Kvr,28-04-2017,"This is the best Mario Kart game to date! Superb courses, nice characters and super smooth game play with a stable 60 fps.
Also for time-trial fanatics there is enough to do with a Nintendo ghost to beat in every level and courses that let ypu master them in every detail, This is a no-brain er for every Nintendo Switch owner.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
DBPirate1129,24-12-2017,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is what one would expect -- a Deluxe version of Mario Kart 8, which was already fantastic on the Wii U.

Deluxe adds several new characters, which are all welcome additions (Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, and King Boo were missing in the original for some reason so it's nice to see them back) as well as an improved Battle Mode. Personally, I've never been a huge Battle Mode player in Mario Kart but this version was definitely fun. It's not something I'm always going to be aching to go back to though. The online is great as usual. The graphics and frame rate are also a huge plus. Nintendo should be applauded for always striving to get a solid 60fps on their games.

If you haven't played Mario Kart 8 before, this is a must-buy. If you have, then I'm tempted to recommend it again just for the sake of being able to take this amazing game on the go.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Jezuzo,19-05-2018,"Es un gran juego exclusivo de Switch, aunque a veces se me hace un poco repetitivo. También pienso que debería tener más modos de juegos, para así quitar la monotonía que son las carreras.

Honestx,22-02-2022,"I will keep this review short I PROMISE!

This is the game that I always come back to when I am bored or the game that I always play when visitors come over or when I want to re-live some moments with my family on the couch. the Mario Kart series have always being that one game everyone has and loves to play. Such great memories I have of this game and past games. Don't even get me started on the ability to play a proper Mario Kart game on the go or even play co-op on the go by flipping the joy-cons on their side. 10/10 legendary game series. great fun at home or on the go!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
llyrowenjones,28-04-2017,"Brilliant and fun game. So vibrant and all races are chaotic and intense. A must buy for the Switch. Online is great and stable, 60fps on handheld and docked.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SuperMatt777,28-04-2017,"A lot of my positive feedback for this game is carried over from the original Mario Kart 8: a slew of amazing tracks, both old and new, superb gameplay, great dlc and loads of multiplayer fun. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe adds a bit more to the table, being 5 new characters, 3 returning favorites and the Inklings from Splatoon, some new kart parts and, of course, the revamped battle mode, which is a great addition to the multiplayer madness Mario Kart is known for. However, despite the praise I give these additions, I can still see flaws. While Mario Kart 8 Deluxe fixed a few problems (mainly the double item holding that was absent in the original), it still holds a few problems that Mario Kart 8 had. The lack of invincibility frames when getting hit by an item can come off as incredibly annoying and opens up item spam from both players and CPUs. This is an incredibly frustrating thing, especially for someone who likes to relax with the game. And, despite the amazing additions, I still believe these were things that should've been in Mario Kart 8 to begin with and really didn't need an 80 dollar port to achieve them. Regardless, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the definitive version of Mario Kart 8 to own. If you never had the original, then this is a must have for the switch, including everything you would've had and more. If you already had the Wii U version, you may feel a slight hint of being ripped off, but if you're also a dedicated fan, then it's something you can likely overlook, especially for something that's fun to play with a group of people.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
kamhagh,24-07-2018,"This game is very okay, It's just mario kart... with better graphic, for 60$ it has WAY too little content, It gets boring after 6h because you just do the same, you race, that's all, there's a battle mode but I don't like it at all personally.

The online mode is very Nintendo. It has long waiting times. and needs a NAT Type B or A

There's just not much to do. you can pretty much play the old ones online on a browser if you want to and it's the same just graphics aren't as good

Pros: Fast loading times means that if you just want a quick race outside (against bots since the NAT Type requirements) it's super easy, I honestly avoid splatoon a lot because of the loading times but that's on a cartridge (slower) too :|

Good graphics at 60fps 1080p afaik when docked

cons:
A huge lack of content, there just isn't much to do

Boring

Bad online multiplayer as expected from Nintendo...

again if you like mario kart go ahead and buy it! But even for someone who is playing it for pretty much the first time it got boring very quickly I don't think I can get a maximum of 20hours of playtime out of this game",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
EpicLadySponge,28-04-2017,"So you know how ports work? They manage to collect information about the original game and modify it to match the modern consoles that we are living in today. Numerous games have done this and some of them may end up tying in its original release, may end up nearly disappointed, or even better... be a complete remake of that original release and manage to be better than its original release. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe falls definitely straight to the latter. If you think Mario Kart 8 wasn't enough, meet Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Definitely more fun than the original Mario Kart 8 and definitely worth the purchase.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
HarryHood,29-04-2017,"Didn't own a Wii U, so this is my first time playing full-screen, HD, online MarioKart...All I can say is ""WOW!"". Brings back the feeling of playing with friends (on a 32"" CRT, usually on the ground) back on 64. The game is locked at 60fps and looks absolutely stunning. The art direction is the best I've seen in this series, and the graphics performance and effects are incredible for a console that is basically a tablet with a fan in it! The amount of content is staggering, and there are quite a few unlocks, considering all characters and tracks are available right from the start. This is one of those games that will be on my Switch until the day it dies.

My only complaints are minor and can be fixed with updates: The amount of overall items, for better or worse, is VERY high in online mode. This can lead to some moments where you're not even moving for long stretches of the race, as you're being pummeled with items. My other issue is that you can't group join/party up with your friends. You can kinda work around it by using the ""join"" button, but it doesn't work well it it's current form (especially compared to other high-polish online games like Rocket League and Overwatch etc) and I think they should look to update it if they're going to begin charging for online services this fall.

All-in-all, I give it a 9.5/10, wonderful game with a long future that's easily worth the asking price. The fact that you can take this game with you anywhere is simply proof we're living in the future!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
TheGeekLantern,08-05-2017,"Una experiencia inigualable. Si te quejas diciendo que este juego es solo un port de la versión de Wii U, hay dos cosas que debes saber:

1- Esta versión mejora cada aspecto del juego además de incluir un Modo Batalla SUBLIME.
2- La sola experiencia de poder disfrutar con amigos en cualquier lugar es algo que no vas a entender hasta que no lo vivas por tu cuenta.

GrumpyReviewer,23-06-2017,"The ultimate friendship-destroyer is back (ish), since it was originally released as an Wii-U title. In any case, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must buy for any Switch owner. I just never get tired of it. Smooth driving, great visuals, awesome cast, variety of karts, fun tracks, MK8D has everything you need for hours and hours of racing fun.

Apart from having a very aggressive AI - who tends to cheat quite a bit - and the absurd amount of blue shells they get, I really cannot point any problems with this game. It's awesome, it's fun, it's a blast, either alone or with someone else.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
amstans,03-05-2017,"This time around they made the game truly addictive and replayable. If you were to compare it briefly to the wiiU version to say it's worth buying it again I would say brighter and not fuzzy. What a difference between the two. I used to think the wiiU version was stunning and now it's painful to look at. Beyond that there are multiple battle modes, new players, new items etc.
They finally nailed it Love this game so much. See you online!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
claytastic,10-07-2017,"Most remastered games nowadays end up being half-assed attempts at making the original game look better without changing the game in any way in order to capture your nostalgia and take your money. Skyrim: Special Edition, Modern Warfare Remastered, BioShock: The Collection and the Dead Rising Trilogy are all perfect examples of this. Once again, Nintendo has had to come in and show every one how something is done with this Switch port of the already amazing Mario Kart 8.
I will concede, however, that in terms of graphics, the game only looks slightly better than the previous version, but it's not a problem since the game already looked great on the Wii U. That's not what makes this game spectacular, though. It's the fact that it's everything the original version was, and more.

All of the DLC tracks and characters are included (something that has failed to make it's way to more recent remasters), and they even made new levels, which means that there's 48 tracks total, and it's not just one of those situations where more is worse because they're less varied. Each level is unique In its visual and level design, which really adds to the game's replayability.

In addition to more maps and characters, they also added a new mode: battle mode. Actually, its a mode with a few different mini-modes. They take certain tracks and turn them into arenas so the players can battle it out. This is done in many different ways, collecting coins, popping balloons, throwing bombs, and my personal favorite, a cops and robbers gamemode where the cops chase the criminals around with piranha plants and criminals have to bust their friends out of jail when they get caught. it's not new since we've seen in previous games, but it's nice to see it return after a long hiatus, since it wasn't present in Mario Kart Wii, 7, or the original version of 8.

To conclude, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is exactly how you do a remastered game. It fixes every problem that I had with the original version, and it changes enough to make it feel like a whole new game, without trampling the legacy of the original. This is the first time in a while where I'm able to say that this is the ultimate way to experience the game. I was going to give it a 9, but then I realized that I actually didn't have any problems with this game, minus the fact that there's 7 different versions of Rainbow Road (making it the Skyrim of Mario Kart), so it gets a well-deserved 10.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Tyke665,30-04-2017,"After 14 years, Double Dash has finally been beaten by Mario Kart 8 Deluxe as the best Mario Kart. As a owner of the original Mario Kart 8, I was very hesitant to buy the game at first because of the lack of new race tracks and the fact that it is sold at full price. But i can assure you that this game is 100% worth it. 48 race tracks, 43 characters, a full and complete battle mode with 5 modes and 8 arenas and a robust online mode: this is by far the most complete Mario Kart game. Plus, you can take the game anywhere with you. If you have a Switch, this is an absolute must buy.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
fire_fist,25-05-2017,"The double item system and new battle mode add a fun new aspect to the game.

Only racing franchise can kill all other racing games easy. DiRT 4 out next month and will not beats MK 8 Deluxe same go for new Forza or Gran Turismo games out later this year and still continue beat by MK 8 Deluxe. :D

Xervoo,30-04-2017,"Fun and exciting game to play, with some form of progression in the kart part unlocks. The racing is a bit unbalanced in the current patch - some items are a bit too common - but the classical mario kart going from 5th to first place in just a few seconds is fun as ever. The battle mode is new and improved and doesn't dissapoint. The current situation on the multiplayer does however. Disconnections are very common. All in all it's a great game, and I have faith that the issues will be fixed in due time.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Zappieroth,01-05-2017,"Game is great in almost every regard, However the multiplayer has connectivity issues.

Other then that there is hardly anything wrong with the game it has everything you would expect from a polished title: 60FPS Stable, Smooth graphics and vibrant colors, A lot of maps and modes to keep you busy for quite a while.

The battle mode is something special, Renegade Roundup is the best mode. This game is worth every penny, i have put 80 plus hours into the game and will continue to do so.

Nagoyablue,28-04-2017,"It's Mario Kart. It's very very fun to play, as always. For the money, it's well worth it to have the best version of Mario Kart ever made.

My one complaint? All courses are unlocked from the start, where as I am used to having to complete each championship to unlock the next. Feels a bit un-natural to be able to race any course from the start. You still unlock Karts and parts, but it's not quite the same.....

Still, excellent game and well worth the money.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
London_Calling,01-05-2017,"A little tricky to review as I've sunk hundreds of hours into the wiiU version and bought the DLC (which speaks volumes in itself).

With a 42 character rooster and 48 stages all together, what more could you ask for? Oh right I forgot, they added a really fun battle mode which is a very welcome addition.

To wrap it up, it's still the Mario kart you all know and love but a ""deluxe"" edition as the name says. It's worth another pick up for Mario kart 8 wii u version owner, and a no brainer for people who don't own this for the wii u",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Gets a bit old getting hit with 3-4 blue shells every race and i still haven't got a single star to use after finishing 24 GP's. Don't get me wrong there is positives to the game like the return of battle mode which is awesome and new characters, Good game that is in need of a major update to sort out the item distribution, Still a must buy for anyone that missed the WII U version.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Creeper3455,01-05-2017,"This is probably THE Mariokart 8 we all needed. I mean,sure,the Wii U version is fine,but this 'Deluxe' version,with all its DLCs,new charachters and new modes,is a tad more playable. There are the same courses and it's the same expirience,but from a graphcal standpoint,like LEGO City Undercover,it looks like they improved the graphics a little bit (And this time,there are no bugs or errors,luckily....). Looks like Nintendo listened about the online multiplayer being not the same without the Battle modes,and it's not a surprise when i say that the Battle modes,with all the new and old maps,are perfectly playable. I mostly play with my Switch when it's on Portable Mode,and the frame rate is fine. It runs at 720p with 60fps,and i'm okay with it. In the end,Mariokart 8 Deluxe may be the first time where a remake is actually better than the original version,with smooth graphics,improved online multiplayer and,of course,the same old Mario fun!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Dargonet,30-04-2017,"The game is really great. I've already owned Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U and all DLC but the Deluxe version with a new Battle Mode, characters, double item slots and third drift boost etc. is still worth to double dip the game for me because it changes the game enough to make a huge difference. However I dislike ""online"" so far. It's the same Wii U experience with more disconnections, bad W-Lan solution integrated within the Nintendo Switch in handheld mode and online needs to be improved in MK8 Deluxe drastically to justify a payment per year for me. Right now it's far away from being good and this don't meet my expectations.

However local multiplayer is even greater with more opportunities playing and easy controls for casual family members are also an extreme good addition for MK8. The new items fit perfectly into the game and it's really amazing playing this game on the go. Beating times on your favorite courses traveling is so far very astonishing.

It's nearly the most perfect fun racing out there. Last thing that needs to be improved is online.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
iNEEDaBowl,09-05-2017,"Overall, super fun. Amazing graphics for Nintendo, not PS4 or XBONE level, but I just love seeing all of the nostalgic characters from my childhood in clean 720p. I would give this a clean 10, but the amount of items constantly in play makes playing online a bit spammy. Even if you have a perfect race you are still bound to have a sequence of getting hit by 2 or 3 items in a row and drop from 1st to 10th. The plethora of items always keeps you in the hunt. But overall the results of each race are more of a slot machine of who has the best items on lap 3 than who is having the best race. The items do make battle mode super fun though.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

BluesBrothers,25-07-2017,"Mario Kart 8: Deluxe is a great example of a remastered port done right and it was a blast to play this on the big screen as well as on the go. The sheer variety of courses, karts, characters, and battle modes is stunning. Although the battle mode is vastly improved, I feel that the could still could have much more with it. The visuals are crystal clear and don't suffer as you undock the console. It's very enjoyable to test your skills online even if you occasionally get booted out. It's awesome to play as new characters from other franchises such as Link and Isabelle. Very solid!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
KingHeavy,12-08-2017,"On the surface, this looks like a port of the Wii U version with a few extra bits sprinkled on. But there's a lot to enjoy, even if you've played the Wii U version before. There's a fun new boost system, the battle mode doesn't suck, and it has Inklings!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Refreshment,18-08-2017,"Mario kart 8 deluxe es una versión mejorada respecto a la de wii u. Al ser una edición deluxe como su propio nombre indica, incluye nuevas cracterísticas respecto al original como: La posibilidad de llevar dos objetos al mismo tiempo, un cuarto turbo al acelerar, nuevos corredores, nuevos vehículos y un modo de batalla en condiciones. Como extra, podemos encontrar los tres DLCs que aparecieron a la venta integrados en esta nueva versión; lo cual, hace al juego más atractivo para aquellas personas que no los adquirieron en su momento.
Como todo juego de la nintendo switch aprovecha las nuevas funciones que ofrece como el poder llevartelo a cualquier parte o poder jugar de manera inalámbrica con otras personas que posean la consola.
El mayor inconveniente que le veo es su elevado precio, los mario kart son un ""must have"" para las consolas de nintendo, sin embargo no nos olvidemos de que estamos hablando de una nueva versión mejorada de un juego que ya salió hace unos años y en mi opinión, no lo tendrían que vender a precio de novedad.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kick454,02-05-2018,"A major improvement over the Wii U version. But it still has some flaws remaining from the other version.

Pros:
+ Soundtrack: AMAZING! It's a mindblowing soundtrack!
+ Gameplay: While it's still just the same ol' Mario Kart gameplay, the gravity gimmick definitely makes the game even more fun. Also 200cc is uncontrollably fun!
+ Characters: Definitely an improvement! Though, where's Funky?
+ Battle Mode: It's definitely an improved version, though I wish there were a few more courses.

Cons:
- Nothing Really ""new"": It's basically a port with a new battle mode and a few new characters. Why not add a few more courses?

Overall, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a really solid entry in the Mario Kart series and warrants a 9.5/10 from me.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Technickle,11-08-2020,"This game is a lot worse compared to it's Wii U release, and the luck factor that comes into play even makes it's a worse experience. Unlike the Wii U version where skill was a factor, luck felt more reasonable. $60 for this? no, no more like $30 maximum. For someone who played A LOT of the Wii U version, I can tell you that, this is not any better. If you still like Mario Kart 8, make sure to keep the Wii U version and dump the Switch version entirely.

Magolor21,26-08-2020,"This game is the perfect example of the Nintendo casual approach post 2010: confusion rules over everything. From a racing game, Mario Kart has officially become a Party game where luck is almost as important as skills.
Most of the choices, from the blue shell running through racers, to the lightning for not mentioning the green shells bouncing crazily everywhere seemed to be done in order to create confusion and help gamers without skills to obtain decent results.
The Mirror mode is totally useless and the 200cc doesn’t suit a track design which wasn’t intended to that.

The item system has completely been flipped upside down for the worse and battle mode is only fun for a while into you find yourself only doing races. Yes it still offers the fun time that Mario Kart 8 does, but it's item system is not great and not enough new stuff was added.

lilbagginz,24-03-2019,"I've played this game for a long time and YES, it was fun at the beginning. But when I kept on playing I realised how broken it was. I was frustrated and discouraged by bad game mechanics.

Threre are so many flaws that I don't even know where to start, but I try to be brief.

1. UNBALANCED: There are different weight classes. But everyone just plays heavies because they've got unfair advantages if you build them right (great speed, high acceleration + turbo, can knock around lightweights).

2. CHEAT MODE: There is literally a cheat option in the settings called 'smart steering'. Actually it's for kids or absolute newbies who have trouble staying on a course without knocking into walls or falling right off. But it's a clear advantage over your opponents on certain tracks like Rainbow Road or in 200cc and destroys any sense of competition.

3. ONLINE: Just horrific! For playing online it's required to pay 20€ anually but getting nothing in return. With nothing I actually mean NOTHING. There aren't any dedicated servers, just Peer-to-Peer!!! The result: everyone lags, only lags, everywhere lags. Nintendo, what are you doing with my money?!
Another side effect of lagging players is that everyone just gets mushrooms instead of other items.

4. MATCHMAKING: As mentioned before there is no real competition because of babysitting/smart steering. High-skilled pros are tossed together with newbies. The philosophy: Everybody can beat/cheat everyone.
Because of the item roulette It's more luck- than skill-based. There is no advantage of being the first because when picking up boxes you get only coins. Meanwhile the guy behind you gets triple red shells and beat the **** out of you right before the finish line.

A typical game looks like this: You lead the whole game and defend your first position like a rabid dog. Then right before the finish line you will ultimately pay the price for your ignorance! Here it comes: First a lightning bolt to take away your items, then a blue shell, a red shell and finally a passing star and rocket. So you drop from your deserved first place to an embarrassing eighth place.",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Coryn78,05-01-2021,"The game is great, I have nothing against it. But instead of giving us a new Mario Kart, like Nintendo did for every console since Mario Kart exists, they just recycled another WiiU title and sold it again with little addition for another 60€. Mario Kart is not the only game to that this happened. It seems to be a trend at Nintendo to just rerelease WiiU games on the Switch. But unlike most other of the recycled titles, Mario Kart is a game you just need for a Nintendo console. With this game, you can't just say: ,,I already own and played the game, I don't have to buy it again'', Mario Kart is just the game you play with friends and family, especially when they aren't that familiar with most or any video games. I am disappointed, because this just feels like a middle finger from Nintendo towards people with a WiiU, because Nintendo makes us having to buy one game multiple times to have something to play with other people. Instead of making the Switch downwards compatible, they recycle old games, and with Mario Kart 8 (Deluxe) I am the most disappointed.",0,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
toastedbuns,29-04-2017,"The best Mario Kart yet! I love renegade mode and shine thief. It's the biggest Mario Kart ever but I miss last man standing in balloon battle mode. The best thing about this game is how replayable it is. You can play this game for hundreds of hours and not get bored. Don't have any friends around? Play online or against the computer. Don't feel like racing? Play battle mode. Or play against the computer in teams, red versus blue in different modes. The music is fantastic as always. This is simply a must have if you own a Switch.

This one is objectively better and reason enough to get a Switch in my opinion because you can play it on the go.
It really is so much fun. The Battle Mode along with most things except car parts being unlocked from the get-go is great.
I also love that you can have 2 items at once now.

I really wish they would add more DLC however. There are so many ol school stages I miss like the DK stage from Double Dash, one of the Bowser Castles from both 3DS(SNES) and DS. The 3DS Mii Sports/Pilot Wings stages.
I mean, you could easily add another 16 awesome stages, and I'd happily pay another 40 bucks for them.
Please Nintendo, give us 4 stage packs for 10 bucks each.

NorwayGamer,02-10-2020,"It's been a while since I played this game - I bought it sometime during the 2017 Christmas season. But the first thing that hit me when I started playing it again was ""wow"" !!

These visuals are extremely impressive, especially considering how underpowered the Switch is compared to the competition. This game easily rivals most games on both Ps4 and Xbone - at least in the graphics department.
The sharp textures, the amazing character models & animation, the level of detail in the courses, and not to mention the lighting effects! just wow!!

The game's appeal is further enhanced by small, but very noticeable tweaks to the gameplay - like two item boxes, an immensely improved battle mode, and other small improvements.

Needless to say, this is my favorite MarioKart to date, and I've played it countless hours since it first arrived on WiiU back in 2014.

Meerkatdawg,30-04-2017,"I've been playing Mariokart since SNES days right up to the WiiU version of this game. There were a couple disappointments on the WiiU mainly regarding the Battle mode. In this Switch version they have been rectified. It's just a fantastic experience and incredibly polished update of the original version. Added to the Switch's great portability and control options, it's impossible not to love and due to the increased popularity in the Switch over the WIIU, there should be a healthy online community too. The online races are not for the faint hearted btw. The only reason I'm not giving it 10 is that there are some graphical issues (most noticeable around the edge of rainbow road N64 version). It's really not enough to discourage anyone though. Oh and the addition of assisted steering and auto gas is great for little kids and those less practised drivers too!

PrimalBanana,17-10-2017,"I’m loving playing through Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and think it’s still quite possibly the best racing game out there if I’m being totally honest. The track design is frankly incredible right down to the themed detailing and the combination of bends and twists for you to power slide through. The music is just perfectly executed and catchy which can be a bit irritating when you’re at work or something admittedly but considering I’m one of those who tends to turn off in game music it’s a compliment to Nintendo that I enjoy listening to their tracks (excuse the pun). There’s so many tracks (race tracks not music) to pick from ranging from new to SNES tracks that have been brought back to life. Fancy a challenge, then select Rainbow road from the SNES and N64 era, when they were much harder than the newer tracks are, it will give you a genuine challenge. I like the challenge this game can offer you. I think it’s something Nintendo used to be really good at but has weakened on in recent years across a variety of its games so it’s good to feel that competition again from the AI. Speaking of AI, they can be ruthless bastards if I’m honest and they can also be like that granny you see doing 20MPH down the country lanes on a Sunday. It does seem a bit erratic at times but for the most part once you progress from the 50CC category they begin to offer you a real challenge. I’ve been playing using the PRO pad, Tablet mode and with the single joy-cons and all felt good to us, although the PRO pad would obviously be my preferred choice given the price of the bloody thing! So what makes Mario Kart 8 Deluxe stand apart from the WiiU version except for that it includes its previous DLC? Well Nintendo have fashioned together some new characters to race as, a new power-slide boost tier, new vehicles, new control assists for the less capable players, the ability to hold two items and a triumphant return of the battle mode which has a variety of game modes for you and your friends to choose from. So, quite the list of new features and it makes the game feel worth buying and playing again. Mario Kart 8 is in conclusion the best racer of this generation, of that I have no doubt. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a must buy if you own a Switch. You’ll have to swallow the £49.99 price tag (that you paid for the game a few years ago if you remember) but all in all it's a price worth paying.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fusy,12-03-2021,"I loved Mario Kart Wii. While the core gameplay remains solid, aspects of this game stop me from finding enjoyment. The twisted tracks are incredibly uncomfortable to drive on. This is especially true for wall riding when your character drives diagonally at the side of the screen. I don't know if it's the angle of my character or the track, or if the camera is too close to the road, but I can't stand these sections. It's weird that no body else seems to have this problem. I'm hoping Nintendo lay off the twists in any sequels or I won't be buying.",3,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
njja02,15-05-2018,"One of the best cart racers I've ever played. Tight controls, amazing visuals, and plenty of great maps. It all feels fantastic. But, the party mode felt a lot more hollow and not all that fun. The main cups were where all of the quality lies.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
night4,04-04-2018,"It's fun, but if you're doing well, you'll never get any items worth squat. I know that's sort of an issue in every other Mario Kart game I've played, but it's compounded by the fact that you often won't get good items if you're doing poorly!

The AI seems to get lightning bolts constantly and conveniently times them as you're jumping over a pit. It happens too often to be coincidence.

I understand that people who are winning shouldn't be getting great stuff, and people who are losing shouldn't *always* get great stuff, but it just feels a little too frustrating after a while.

MK 8 was already the best entry in the franchise, and Deluxe just builds on, enhances, and polishes everything that makes the game so great.

The courses look very smooth and detailed, the character roster is great and includes characters from games like Animal Crossing to Splatoon, and the soundtrack captures the nostalgia of the game perfectly. Online racing has never been as much fun as with this entry and will probably turn out to be the one gamemode you'll keep coming back to. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a fun game to play with friends, whether it's at home, in the park, at school or online.

The only thing I don't enjoy as much as I expected, is the revamped Battle Mode. It feels a bit bland and boring to me, maybe a bit too polished and smooth. It isn't like the chaotic Battle Modes you know from the good old DS or the Wii, instead this Switch version of Mario Kart offers a more easy, less challenging Battle Mode, with easier stages and modified Battle modes.

I can play an incredibly similar version of the game on WiiU using my Wii wheels and it feels so much better to play. Zelda BotW (which is an absolute turd of a game), Mario Kart, Tokyo Mirage, Toads Treasure Tracker, Xenoblade Chronicles, all Wii/WiiU games. Nintendo need to stop rehashing old games. Fire Emblem 3 Houses was amazing, Mario and Rabbids was really good. They're still capable but being extremely lazy in my eyes.

The original Mario Kart 8 was great, but this expanded on it greatly. New characters like Inklings were added, all the DLC from Mario Kart 8 is built-in, and there's even some new karts. Battle mode is now an actual battle mode, with there being actual battle tracks unlike in the original Mario Kart 8 where you'd just battle in the regular race tracks. They also added good battle mode gamemodes. These gamemodes are Shine Thief, Balloon Battle, Coin Runners, Bob-Omb Blast, and Renegade Roundup.

GhostSurfer,03-03-2022,"Just to balance out the numbers, this has to be the worst mariokart I’ve been ever played next to the first one. The way you unlock cars and parts takes wayyyy too long. You get a max of 10 coins per race and races take a good 2-6 mins and eventually you’ll get a new part at 100 coins increments later. They have a “smart” steering and auto driving for babies. I mean really? Where’s the challenge in that. And that brings me to my last and the most offended decision they made in Mario 8 deluxe. Rubber banding, F-ing rubber banding, takes all the skill out of the game, you could be miles ahead but they will be given the best weapons and will be faster than you to catch up. I saw some say “it makes it interesting, it makes it fun” to that absolutely NO! Rubber banding treats you like a kid that is given a win that doesn’t know they actually didn’t do it on your own, that you can’t do it on your own. Rubber banding does the opposite for people that are good at the game, they take the win from you, they keep the other karts near you even if you hit a prefect run all the boosts, all the power drifts, power jumps, jump boosting. It takes a game that is somewhat skill based and says “nope we are going to restrict you because you are too good” and if you’re bad “we are going to pretend you are good” That’s what rubbering banding does to gamers and you can test it out for yourself. Do a good start have someone on split screen behind you watching your good start then do a bad start and you’ll see the other computers stick to your kart. It’s so f-ing bad",0,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Yiskanute,29-04-2017,"By far the most 'definitive' Mario Kart you're going to find for a while. Is it fun? Depends. Do you find being smacked by twenty-two red shells fun? Do you like courses littered with bananas? Do you like being struck by lightning twice in a row?

The game plays well, don't get me wrong, but I feel like the balance of the game is thrown out of wack because of the two-item system. It makes staying in first place harder, which is probably the intention, but it also makes getting ahead of the middle of the pack harder because two items per player just means you're going to experience being a crab in a bucket more often than not.

Ultra mini turbos, while a nice addition, is too tricky to pull off in most cases as a lot of courses aren't exactly built with them in mind and when you're playing 150cc or 200cc, it becomes nearly detrimental to try and pull them off.

New battle mode is pretty sweet and a complete upgrade from what we got in the original, plus the portability of this Mario Kart port means you get the best handheld Mario Kart experience, sorry, 7, but 8 got you beat here.

In short, a nice port but not worth the asking price for existing owners of MK8. Balance is horrible thanks to the existence of the two-item system, meaning that while this is the more definitive version of Mario Kart 8, it is also the least balanced of the two by a long margin.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
mrswitch2687,03-05-2017,"I could spend all day telling you what is good about this game. But i won't. All I will say is that there is plenty to do depending on your preference and that the online racing is superb. I will spend most of my time time-trialling or on the net. The only minor gripe for me is that there is no Switch Original Courses and that sometimes ( v. occasionally) the backgrounds graphics can look.... lazy. But this does not really detract from how good this game really is. Yes, it is similar to the Wii U version and there will be some people who dislike Mario Kart just for being what it is (having a handicap style system where the lower down the field you are, the better weapons you get- which I think is perfect), but the battle mode changes and all the other little tweaks to an already excellent game make this a very worthwhile pickup.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Sad that one of the most inventive gaming companies in the world has resorted to repackaging the same game over and over and charging full price for it. It is folly to believe that this is anything new or imaginative or is gaming nirvana in any way.

SonicCam91,30-06-2017,"I feel this is a missed opportunity on Ninendo's part as a lazy port for the Switch version of Mario Kart 8. I loved the original Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U But have grown to really hate the new version for the Switch. What's new? Not much. 5 new characters (some are copies of gendered Squid characters from Splatoon), some new Battle mode tracks, and um, that's pretty much it.
It's kind of like Nintendo said ""Hey we forgot to add this stuff in the last game. How do we cash in on this? Let's just turn this into a new game and port it!""
I hate how the game encourages you to replay all of the cups over and over again to unlock certain rewards like the exclusive character Gold Mario. To unlock his vehicle parts you need to replay the same game over and over again. Soon it becomes more tedious than fun and I actually started to get very angry at being bored with it. Then I thought ""Is doing all this just for a new character skin really worth it?"" No, it's not.
I guess i'm also negative about it because I had the Wii U version already, but I honestly enjoyed the Wii U version a lot better.

vahn,29-10-2017,"You got Mario kart 8 on the wii u with all the dlc? Don't bother: you're basically going buying the same EXACT game, with just all the dlc included and an insane full price retail (because if you gotta milk your fans, do it at full force!). Hence this game is a zero. Because it has zero value.

You DON'T have Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U? Well..give it a 3 because it's a pretty shallow game with content that can last a day even if you play on the highest difficulty, since it's only hard for you and nobody else. Infact I gave 7 out of 10 on the wii u because while I enjoyed it, It really had nothing going on for me, literally nothing, and the extra characters were essentially all bloody reskins of baby bowser or toads. Genius Nintendo is genius.

Honestly, there are better kart games around: I'm not a fan but I still think Sonic all stars racing and its sequel Transformed to be far superior ""kart"" games and I lost countless hours on those games - they only lack is the online but I usually count it as a plus, not as the main feature (with exceptions of course)

Infact I dare say, if you got people to play with, and you only care about playing online, then this game might be slightly higher on the numbers and maybe a good 5 out of 10.

But as a solo experience, don't waste 60 euros/dollars on it: it has so little content and so much unbalanced gameplay (hello money coins every freaking time!) that I was just glad to have tried it without purchasing it.

Xaphnir,06-05-2020,"This is the most frustrating game I've ever played, and that's say a LOT. Skill doesn't feel like it factors into the game at all. To give an example:

I spent 4 hours trying to win a 150cc grand prix. Was it due to lack of skill? Was I improving consistently throughout these four hours?

No.

All I was doing was rolling the RNG over and over and over again trying to get one attempt where I didn't get repeatedly screwed over by blue or red shells right before the finish line, or didn't get targeted 10 times per lap by items. And when I finally won, I was also helped by different AI doing better in different races, reducing their score and allowing me to win by one point.

I could see this being fun if you have friends or family to play on the same console with. The core game mechanics are solid, and the tracks are quite good. But if all you're going to do is play against the AI or online? Don't waste your time or money.

Overall, it's a game with potential ruined by excessive RNG.",4,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Sidian,10-05-2017,"I've been playing since the SNES version and this is EASILY, by FAR the worst Mario Kart game I have ever played.

- Impressively, the AI cheats more than it ever has before. In every other Mario Kart game I could lap the other racer with ease, in this one that is simply not possible because of the absolutely insane level of rubber banding. Getting 1st place is often down to luck due to the absurd amount of cheating the AI does; the amount of times I've been screwed over literally seconds before the finish line is beyond counting. Not to mention the much more blatant cheating I've seen, such as items going directly through defences I have prepared, blue shells ignoring the racer in 1st place to go for me, I've even seen racers teleporting ahead.

Well, at least there's online mode, right? Wrong.

- Online mode is completely and utterly ruined by several things. Firstly, it allows you to use cheats. That's what I'm calling 'smart steering' because unless it's a map with great, hard to access shortcuts then it is effectively cheating and there is no real disadvantage to using it. Remember the fun of playing on maps like Rainbow Road in the past and laughing as people fell off? Those days are gone, as it's impossible to do so now.

- As usual Nintendo fails to offer basic online functionality. Want to play in 200cc races? Too bad! You have to randomly search for a match and it will often be much slower. You want a balanced match? Too bad! There is seemingly no matchmaking whatsoever and people with triple the average rating of the match will be in the race for no good reason.",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

AlexToral_F,08-05-2017,"Ahora que los ports y las remasterizaciones se han puesto de moda, Nintendo no iba a ser menos y ha decidido subirse al carro, empezando por un juego con más ventas en la incomprendida y mal parada Wii U.
Para empezar, en cuanto al apartado sonoro no hay nada que añadir, puesto que no se percibe ningún cambio notable. En cuanto a lo visual, se nota cierta mejora en cuanto a la calidad: en modo sobremesa corre a 1080 y 60fps estables y en modo tableta a los ya vistos en Wii U 720 y 60fps. Sí es verdad que en el modo multijugador a pantalla partida de 4 jugadores se nota una pequeña bajada de velocidad. En lo que al online respecta, va fluido, pero tampoco es para tirar cohetes.

Ahora, centrándonos en lo importante: ¿merece la pena comprarlo? Este Mario Kart es uno de los más divertidos y competitivos de la saga: el aumento de la dificultad y el modo multijugador mejorado ofrecen más diversión todavía y el añadido de todos los personajes y circuitos (incluyendo nuevas características y los DLCs) se agradece; sin embargo, se hecha de menos la alegría que da el desbloquear elementos como personajes o copa, ya que, a excepción de los vehículos y una nueva skin para Mario de metal, todo viene ya en bandeja.

En mi opinión, si no tuviste la oportunidad de comprar y disfrutar del juego en Wii U, esta es una estupenda manera de hacerte con el mejor Mario Kart de la saga. Si bien le has echado horas a la anterior versión hasta quemar la Wii U, el juego se hará algo repetitivo a no ser que revientes el multijugador.

PD: las pegas que se le ponen a este juego por parte de muchos usuarios no tienen que ver casi con el MKD DX en sí, sino en la compra de este. Pagar 60 euros por un port como si fuera algo nuevo para todos los jugadores habiendo gente que ya ha tenido este juego, es algo abusivo y no hubiera estado de más algún tipo de plan renove o de recompensa a los usuarios por parte de Nintendo.

Sí, es el Mario Kart más completo de todos y sí, al final se convierte en un obligado, pero tampoco ha supuesto una novedad ni un boom tan grande como para convertirse en el mejor de la saga.

MediaFreak,08-05-2017,"Good game ruined by bad AI.

If you're playing with friends or online mario kart 8 is a great game, tonnes of tracks, tonnes of modes, and the 200cc mode is excellent.

If however you're going to play single player, you're not going to have a very rewarding experience. There are no new tracks or characters really to unlock, your just playing for trophies and stars. 50cc and 100cc are boringly easy, 150cc now seems defunct because of the far superielor 200cc where you actually need to breaking during your drifts.

Time trials are pretty fun, but the GP is just an infuriatinf mess most of time. Probably the worst since mario kart 64 (where ai controlled cars would go faster if you over took them preventing you getting a substantial lead.) What makes mario kart 8 gp so bad is the number of cars, theres 12 in a race and they are all gunning for you. You can pretty much predict the order that they'll all finish every race, which is annoying when you don't win a cup after being hammered by everyone on the last lap, even though you placed 1st in the other races.

They had faster speed than my brother and I, and we had to rely on mini turbos and mushrooms to pass them. Even when I shook the controller, the game still wouldn't let me do tricks, and the AI racers were smart enough to drive almost perfectly on the tracks. They also always weigh more than human racers no matter what character or vehicle combo you pick, so AI racers almost always knock you off the track when they bump you. Ai racers also always get better items. I've had instances where I was last place and all I get is triple mushrooms, and even when I'm near the front, all I get is a mushroom when I need a banana or a shell the most for defense against red, green, and blue shells, which AI racers always get, and then they wait till I'm the one in front of them when they all aim for me.

However the battle mode surprised me and makes this game worthwhile.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Xxdaniels751xX,10-05-2017,"The same as always, great fun with friends but it looks like a dlc from wii u. They could have innovated a little more since according to nintendo, the switch was going to be the revolution both in games and in design and this mario kart as it is not revolutionary.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Aldeberuhn,18-06-2017,"Having played this game already on the Wii U, the Deluxe version really didn't add a whole lot to the experience. Mario Kart 8 seemed like a great and innovative approach to the Mario Kart franchise when it first came out on the Wii U, but the newer version feels more like a cash grab at this point. The addition of Inkling racers from Splatoon is a nice touch and the graphics are a little crisper, but when you're speeding around the track, the slightly upgraded graphics aren't all that noticeable. I understand that the game was released on the Switch in order to appeal to a larger audience, but there just isn't enough added to it for it to be worth the price of a brand new $60 game, especially if you've already purchased all the DLC on Wii U.

Another big issue with this game is the online setup. Whatever netcode Nintendo used on the Wii U version was evidently carried over to the Switch with no improvements. You will find yourself being disconnected from online matches multiple times in a single play session. Meanwhile, the races that you aren't kicked out of suffer from extreme lag issues. Playing against laggy people online really gets annoying when none of your items appear to affect your target, despite it clearly showing the animation that they've been hit. You'll also find yourself being hit by items that never seemed to exist in the first place. Items will materialize right in front of you, giving you no opportunity to defend yourself. The online portion of this game is terrible, and I'm really disappointed in Nintendo for not even caring to fix it after the issues people were having on the Wii U. If anything, the problems seem more common on the Switch, but that may just have to do with the larger amount of users.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Max_Sheedy,30-07-2017,"All of this games key components craft a fantastic fun experience for any age.And from playing over 100 hours of this masterpiece I can say that I am very pleased, good original characters, lots of karts to choose from and one of the most important this game can run at a good 60 fps in a stable clear format. But i'm giving this game a sore of 8 because of some of the game features, so, you hop into a game with 11 other players, then you race for 3 laps, but one of the worst features is that if you are in first place all the items you can get are the bananas which are completely useless and the coin, but the most annoying thing in this game is that you are about to finish 1st then you get hit by a blue shell then several other objects, i wish Nintendo could stop this but its just how this game was designed.

Robjapan,29-04-2019,"It's a wiiU mario kart game on switch. Did Nintendo release switch without telling anyone? Why wasn't a new mario kart game ready for the switch??
If I had played this on the wiiU then this game would be getting a 3/10.
As it is, it's a good game, the game play, maps, graphics and handling are all excellent.
There are multiple weapons in the game which are entirely unnecessary. If people aren't good enough to catch up or win races, then so be it. Having people win races because they got multiple bullet bills on the last lap is such ****
No weapon should exist in the game that allows the player to do something automatically.
Green shells, red shells, mushrooms and stars. Nothing else is needed in the multiplayer at least.
In the single player, hey go crazy and give us interesting challenges, maybe we have to use a bullet bill to get over a gap or whatever.
I'm giving this game a 6/10 because it's still fun to play with friends, but on your own it's an exercise in annoyance and frustration.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

PaddingtonBear,10-10-2018,"As a seven year old kid in 1992, I absolutely loved Super Mario Kart. However, the Super Nintendo was the last gaming console by Nintendo that I owned until fourteen years later when the Wii was released. During that time, my taste in games changed, and Mario Kart became a distant memory.

As a present for Christmas '18, my girlfriend requested a Switch. Frankly, it held no appeal to me, as I've never been a fan of handheld gaming consoles, it didn't offer a unique experience (unlike the Wii), and the limited time I spent gaming was already fulfilled on a gaming PC or Xbox One X. However, it did provide an opportunity to take a trip down memory lane with Mario Kart 8, so my girlfriend was gifted a Switch, and I got to indulge in nostalgia.

Quickly glancing at user reviews on this website for Mario Kart 8 will show an abundance of 10/10 ratings. This would indicate it is a perfect game. Unfortunately, it's not, and far from it. There are many facets to Mario Kart 8, and most of them are fantastic. However, the most important facet, the game play, is absolutely infuriating and severely detracts from the experience. Anyone providing a 10/10 rating is either a shill (i.e. paid-for reviewer), a massive fanboy, or hasn't completed a single race with AI opponents.

Prior to playing Mario Kart 8, I would have thought that using the word ""infuriating"" to describe a Mario Kart game would be nothing more than a demonstration of an oxymoron. Unfortunately, it provides a concise summary. The game play is fixated on enforcing an artificial balance of skill. In other words, if you have a low-skill player in last position and a high-skill player in first position, the game logic severely stacks the odds in favor of the low-skill player in last position. It does this through manipulation of the item box outcomes and AI interactions. Whilst the developers likely think this creates an enjoyable challenge for the high-skill player, it doesn't, as it's a cheap and irritating game play mechanic. If the low-skill player wins, it's a hollow victory, as both players are well aware that the outcome has been largely determined by the overbearing artificial balancing system.

If you spend the majority of your time in first position, item boxes will only produce bananas and coins (with the very occasional useful item, such as a horn, being immediately forfeited by a lightning strike before an opportunity to use it arises), and you'll be continuously bombarded by AI opponents (especially on the final lap) with Blooper ink, blue and red shells, and lightning (which you recover from slower than other players) until you inevitably lose the race. This isn't as much of an issue in the 50cc class, where closing the distance on incapacitated players takes longer, but for all other classes it very much is.

Item box outcomes should be utilizing randomly generated numbers with slight offsets. The keyword being ""slight"". A player in first position should not be limited to bananas and coins, and a player in last position should not be guaranteed high-powered offensive items.

I also believe that the default controller configuration needs to be initially obvious to players. My girlfriend and I spent several races bemused at why the steering was randomly ineffective, until we discovered that both smart-steering and tilt-steering were both enabled, which was fighting against our intended actions. An initial prompt on our first race would have made us aware that these controller assist options existed, and allowed us to disable them if desired.

My final criticism is that there seemingly isn't any long-term appeal for Mario Kart 8. Once you've raced in (and presumably won the trophies for) the various cups, which takes a weekend of your time, that's it. What other motivation for playing is there? Sure, you can fire it up when friends visit, but once again, the local multi-player is largely ruined by the artificial balancing system.

If the game play gets tweaked in the future, I will return to revise my review. Currently, however, I just don't think it's worth the $70 AUD asking price.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

This Game has Good Gameplay, Track,Free DLC and everything important that needs a Mario Kart.
BUT there are a lot of things why this Game isnt a good one.
First im a person that dont play Games to Pas some Time games are in my Eyes only good if there have Somthing Speciel ore somfing thats make the Game to ART.
When i am real this Game is UNDER Mario Kart Wii and Mario Kart 8(Becuse its a Port)
So there are a LOT of Downgrades in this Game that are for Normal Persons Not very Specil but for Game Designers Like Me you must do a view from another Pespctive.
Lets Get into it.
First:
This Game has PINK GOLD PEACH ok thats not really a fact but its a Worst caracter ok.
Second:
This Game has fewer animations then MARIO KART WII lol, Like Trick Jumping in the First Game where this Got Invented the Caracters had more Animations than Today WHY i dont now.
Also where is My Camera show from all Posebil Perspectivs like MKWII in this game the camera is after Win/Lose only in the third person front WHY.
Third:
The Music i dont mean the Track Music this is Good but the Hub Music ore The Win / Lose Music is SO BAD i dont now if this is my one feling but really The Music is Bad in this Game.
Forth: This is a port and added absolutly NOTHING new to the Game (Tracks dont count).
So there are a lot of things why this Game is Bad/Good but i dont wanna Tell all of it ye.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

FreedomFighters,04-03-2018,"This review will not be a critical assessment of ""Mario Kart 8"" as a whole. I've already written a review for the Wii U version of the game, which you can read if you head over to my profile. Rather, this review will be discussing how the Nintendo Switch port of ""Mario Kart 8,"" also known as ""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe,"" stacks up against the Wii U version. Is it worth it? Yes, absolutely.
""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe"" features a few solid differences from the Wii U version, notably 1080p graphics, the ability to hold two items, brand new characters, a highly-revamped (and much needed) battle mode, new features to help beginners out, and a lot more! Nintendo really took things into account with this one, working to make sure it wasn't just a lazy ""port"" of the game, and their effort shows!
So, should you buy it? Well, if you don't already own the Wii U version, buy this new ""Deluxe"" edition NOW!!!!! However, if you own the Wii U version, it depends on how the revamps to Battle Mode (along with the new characters) sound to you. Like 'em? Go get it! Not interested? Just stick to the Wii U version. Regardless of your system of choice, ""Mario Kart 8 Deluxe"" is an absolutely amazing game and everyone should have it in their collection, regardless of whether they own a Switch or a Wii U.

Espolosin,20-12-2018,"El mejor Mario Kart y el mas completo de la historia.

Mario Kart es una saga enorme con muchos años y con varias entregas lanzadas hasta día de hoy, si bien todos los Mario Kart han superado a su antecesor este lo supera por mucho, es el mismo videojuego que el de Wii U pero con sus DLCs incluidos y varios añadidos que lo hacen el mejor de toda la saga.

En este Mario Kart como es ya común, contamos con varios pilotos, vehículos, circuitos, copas, modos de juego... Pero en este se amplia mucho mas, de contar con 8 copas pasamos a tener 12 lo que conlleva a tener 48 circuitos, que son una brutalidad.

También continuamos con el sistema de personalización de vehículos de Mario Kart 7 pero con mucha mas profundidad y los ala delta, y la gran novedad de este Mario Kart 8 que se añade el sistema de cambio de gravedad en los circuitos, que hace que la forma de pilotar vaya un paso mas adelante.

En el apartado gráfico no deja a nadie indiferente y se pueden apreciar perfectamente los 1080p 60fps, un magnifico apartado técnico que hace que la Nintendo Switch una vez mas no tenga nada que envidiar de las demás consolas.

En cuanto a jugabilidad es increíble lo realmente bien que se siente tener el control de los vehiculos, en todo momento se siente tener el control total, y da una gran satisfacción cuando se llegan ha hacer autenticas proezas.

Nintendo en esta ocasión apuesta por ir sacando de vez en cuando contenido gratuito, ya sea como aspectos para los corredores o mas vehículos, y hace que el juego se mantenga vivo.

En conclusión, una experiencia increíble que todo el que tenga una Nintendo Switch no se puede perder.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Why have controls in game that help disabled players play if they are hampered with the losing points mechanic, I feel everyone should get at least 1 point for participating and points shouldn't be taken away from players.

Cart customisation should be expanding using a render.material change mesh allowing you to customise the colours of the kart, wheels and kite.

red shells should lock on to the person in front of the person when the red shell is used and therefore if a player over takes someone else when they are targeted with it the target should swap.

Boxes shouldn't be despawned by people going through them as losing out on a box due to faster karts is very unfair. Lightning shouldn't effect anyone behind the player using the lightning.

And finally the game should allow the player to choose which of the two items to use first by having a swap item button.

Offline play should allow you to select which items are in play and should allow you to choose the items raity using a percentage meter.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Each track is memorable (bar a few retro tracks which are downright boring) and the music is really good. The graphics are gorgeous, and the attention to detail in each track is stunning. I haven't played much of the battle mode yet but from what I have seen it looks like so much fun. As far as Mario Kart games go, this is probably one of the best ones.

My biggest criticism of the game however is the horrible online system. Connecting to a game is such a pain and will take forever to load. However, I understand that this may not be a problem on Nintendo's part and it may be my own internet connection problems.

No le doy una mejor nota al juego (pese a ser un monstruo de contenido) porque no lo siento como la experiencia Mario Kart definitiva pese a tener todo el contenido que necesita y más ¿La razón? Es una versión completa del juego de Wii U, la cual en su momento me deslumbró y por lo mismo compré su DLC.

jbakes25,18-09-2017,"Mario Kart 8 is very beautiful racing game. The graphics are top notch. The environments beg you to stop going fast and admire the scenery. The new tracks are stunning, and the classic tracks were given a nice touch. The music scores in each track compliment the scenery. Nintendo did not need to add as many racers as they did like the different babies and costumes for Mario and Peach, but adding Link and Animal Crossing characters was a nice touch. With the deluxe version, you get all the added DLC from the Wii U version so all 16 of the new tracks are there with the original 32 tracks , and the price is good for what you get in a fun racing game. Online racing is still smooth as it was on Wii U, and you will have a lot of fun racing other real world players. Battle mode on the deluxe version has been fixed to give us the battle mode we all love. All the fun modes from Shine Runners to Bomb-Omb Blast are back and the new cops and robbers mode is a fun idea. Mario Kart may look like the same racing game every new entry, but it always draws you in to see all the new creativity put into each game, and this one is no different.

Simple yet incredibly satisfying gameplay. A multitude of courses, characters, and customization options in general. There is so much to be said about this game, but all in all, it is one of the best Switch titles.

Moreover, if you didn't get the DLC but had the original MK8, it's easily worth it. If you had the DLC, weigh up how much you like Battle Mode and the portability factor.

As a final note, this is the first Switch game that really makes use of the hardware. Every single control option works great, portable is amazing, touchscreen actually works (eat your heart out BOTW).

With these few new features, I was able to fully three-star all the grands prix and beat all the staff times in time trials, including the dreaded Cheep Cheep Beach and Dragon Driftway ghosts.

Es divertido como todos, las nuevas funciones de 2 items, 200cc y modo batalla me parecen unos buenos añadidos sin lugar a dudas.
Lo mejor que tiene es que es un juego que gusta a todo el mundo, y se echa muy buenas partidas en casa con amigos. El plato fuerte debería estar en el online, pero en mi caso se queda a medio camino (por eso le doy un 8 y no un sobresaliente). Me hubiera gustado que sea más competitivo, me explico, añadir rangos o niveles como en la mayoría de juegos online, una manera para que vean cómo eres en ese juego. El simple hecho de mostrar una puntuación de por ejemplo 3000 puntos no quiere decir que seas un hacha en el online, ya que lo más fácil es puntuar en las carreras (por encima de la posición 9). Sé que está el modo torneo, pero no creo que eso equivalga a obtener rangos por así decirlo. También ese notable lo doy por se un juego de sesiones cortas, ya que no apetece estar jugando muchas horas seguidas, se hace monótono y fácilmente lo dejas de lado al cabo de semanas, jugando nuevamente tiempo después en ocasiones puntuales.

It is worth every penny of it's purchase price, I might even go as far as to say it it worth buying a Switch, unless you already own it on Wii U and have all the DLC already. The only worthwhile change in the Switch version that is worth definitely checking out is the revamped Battle mode.

The only thing I do not like that much is the character selection. Of course, you have all your classics like Mario, Luigi, Peach Bowser etc. but why did they feel the need to add characters like Cat Peach or Metal Mario or even the baby versions of those characters for example like daisy and Rosalina. In my opinion, those options should have been skins for the regular versions of those characters, like how you can choose the colour of Yoshi. You could have replaced those stupid characters with ones like Zelda, Ganon, Samus or Sonic.

This becomes expensive DLC, but personally it's worth it. The new mechanics are additions and having it portable to great.

You own Mario Kart 8 + DLC:
This was the situation I was in, I assume if you have MK8 and the DLC your a fan of mario kart making it definitely worth it. Nothing's new really, but it every minute is fun and the split screen online is amazing.

The game is super fun and since Zelda is the only Switch Game People bought it for (like me), it is nice to have a great alternative. Also, I love how it doesn't drain the battery. I have noticed this with a few games, I got a good 9-10 hours give or take before I had to charge, but I was on like airplane mode and the lowest brightness. In my opinion, this is the best Mario Kart, but take that with a grain of salt I have only played Wii, DS, and 7 so I don't have much to go off of.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Jtplaz3,19-07-2017,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings all of the mechanics from the other Mario Karts and combines it into an action packed fun, mobile, experience on Nintendo Switch. The game looks great in Docked/Handheld mode, and the game seems to suffer from no bugs from what I've seen. However, sometimes when playing Mario Kart 8 Deluxe I feel irritated at the fact that I can easily be taken from 1st place to 8th place with just one Blue shell or a single Lightning Strike. But I guess that what makes Mario Kart, Mario Kart.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
jikflet,22-07-2017,"Not only the best Mario kart, but probably the best racing game ever! it deserves a solid 10 score for the co-op play, the tense situations, the laughs with your friends when you trow a red shell and make them loose first place when race is about 5 seconds to finish, the anger when you slip with a banana after getting hit by a green shell, after getting hit by the blue shell. if you are reading this, and having toughs about buying it.... why is that? why are you still here? go now and get it! a must have on the switch. period.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Nestiray,21-07-2017,"I had already bought this game on the Wii U version a couple of years back when it first came out. I liked a lot and played almost every day, it was the first ""good"" first party game the Wii U had so obviously I was playing the whole time. It was an amazing game and I loved it, but the version of the Switch is a bit different.

The game, graphics wise, is really good. All the popping colors on your face at high speeds feels and looks really, really great. Content wise it's just amazing, you already get so many characters, stages and modes off the go, plus the revamped battle mode is **** brilliant. With online service and multiplayer features this game is an instant 10/10 for me since I didn't buy any of the DLC on the Wii U version. But even thought this game is so good it just gets overshadowed by the masterpiece that is Breath of the Wild. The game is missing something to make me play it more. Right now this is something you could play when you had enough of Zelda or just want to play Switch with your friends. if you have a Switch this is a must buy though, it's a really good game, better than Forza by a long run.
Final Rating: 9.5/10, ""Great game""",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kallenovsky,18-01-2019,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is a fast and fun experience, though certainly more with friends and family or online rather than solo. It's a better party game than Mario Party that provides excellent challenges, multiple modes, and plenty of tracks and circuits from throughout the series' history. The game could have had more characters, or at the least a more diverse list. Instead, there are too many different versions of specific characters (Mario, Baby Mario, Metal Mario, Tanooki Mario, etc.) that could have simply been costume changes like the Miis have. There can't even be arguments for licensing since Smash has so many others.

I also noticed that unlike all other games on the Switch that I've played so far, only Mario Kart 8 Deluxe seems to have issues with the multi-player joy-con analog sticks shifting slightly left or right depending on the controller. This is the case any controller being used, yet they all work fine on any other game and are not in need of calibration.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
LordDecky,10-07-2019,"This is probably one of my favorite games on the switch. Beautiful well designed tracks that make your jaw drop.

Hillis,05-04-2018,"Although it may seem like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe offers very minimal upgrades on its Wii U predecessor, the improved Battle Mode and other neat additions like Auto-Accelerate and Smart Steering really help refine this often rage-enducing and friendship-breaking experience. Honestly Auto-Accelerate is now just such an integral part of the game for me as it allows me to brake-drift so much easier, which is crucial in 200cc. And this improved Battle Mode, complete with online, would warrant an extra purchase alone, with the original Mario Kart 8's Battle Mode being a blemish on an otherwise perfect game. While the online experience is still a bit lacklustre and could be improved and streamlined, especially after seeing what ARMS did with its online lobbies, there's just so much here that entices old fans back for another race and appeals to new ones. The best Mario Kart to date, undoubtedly.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

but i have family that is BAD at video games, due to being grandparents, or small children...

The game has bright colors that compliments the game with the the Mario feel that is needed to make a successful Mario title.

wpng,01-06-2018,"To me, the Mario Kart franchise feels a little boring. Racing in singleplayer mode feels kind of meaningless. And I think that mainly has to do with the lack of rewards, especially in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. All of the levels are already unlocked when you first start the game up. For example, in Mario Kart Wii you have to unlock all of the levels thru playing singleplayer mode. So that when you unlock those levels it acts as a reward for playing the singleplayer mode. Sure you can get trophies in Deluxe, but you cant doing anything with them. This game shines in its Online matches and multiplayer mode.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

This game does have a few fun surprises like the vehicle upgrades. My 6 and 8 year old girls love this game, and they play it quite a bit, but I personally don't find it that interesting so I wasn't able to play it much (maybe because I played the older versions of Mario Kart for so many years). I do like that this is a very kid friendly game (even a very young child can enjoy this game). Adults can have fun with it too (overall, its very family friendly).

UchihaBawb,09-02-2018,"Mario Kart 8 was the best Mario Kart to date and unfortunately released on the Wii U. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe expands on near perfection by adding elements you didn't know you wanted or needed.
It brings back battle mode using classic levels that awake the little child in you and has created new, with a sense of familiarity, battle types for all players with differing levels of experience.
If you had the original version, is it worth forking out for this? - I'd answer yes and I have. With over 200 hours played on Mario Kart 8 and enough coins and stars to bring us all out of a recession I still have fun with this game and enjoy the time spent with my friends and family, only this time we're trying to get the same coins and stars as last time however knowing more of the little secrets each level has.

Kire_92,20-08-2018,"A fun and relaxing game that’s perfect to play when on the go or with friends. The game is very well made with a lot of charm and you can tell that Nintendo have invested a lot of passion when making the game. The local and online multiplayer is where this game really shines. It provides a bigger challenge when playing online and when playing with friends it’s easy for those who don’t play games that much too just jump in and play alongside you. The racing part of the game is also very satisfying and fun and feels very polished.

Though there are some problems with the game in my opinion. I wish there was more tracks that was a bit longer. Most races last only about 3 minutes and it would be nice to have more options in the lengths of races. The game also has a problem that it can get boring fast. It’s not a game that I can play for a few hours and still feel entertained. Most sessions only last 30 – 60 minutes before I want to stop playing. It somehow starts to feel repetitive and does not offer much variety and lacks meaningful progression and rewards. Though after putting the game down and returning the next day I have no problem in playing it for another 30 minutes when on the go.

Overall the game is a fun, casual game that’s perfect when I just want to have a bit of fun. Though it does not offer anything extraordinary and works only as a bit of temporary fun for me and my friends, but it does that job very good and I love playing it from time to time.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MK8 is an endlessly fun racing game with an incredibly broad appeal, from the most casual player to serious gamers. It's hard to give it a perfect score, because it's ultimately just refining the same old formula, and it feels like it could use some kind of ""story mode"" for single players.

MrSlim,22-03-2018,"This game is the most content packed Mario Kart game yet! And it is really good! (Aside from 2 things)...

the gameplay is very, very fun.... and playing it with friends is a great time time! I would recommend this game to any Switch owner....
unfortunately, if you owned the original game on Wii U, this won't be the best time for you, so take it with a grain of salt... it feels like the same game, nothing's different (coming from someone who put 100+ hours into MK8), after around 10 hours of gameplay, it got boring.... and I haven't really used much since around June...

the 2nd problem (for me) are the character selection, you can be the most amount of characters in this Mario Kart than anyone before it, but there are a lot of shovel ware characters here, Metal Mario, Tanooki Mario, Cat Peach, Baby Peach, Baby Daisy and Baby Rosalina to name a few... you also can't forget the infamous Pink Gold Peach, personally I'd rather have them get rid of these characters than have them at all....

Basically, if you haven't played this game (or little of it) than I highly suggest this game, but if you have played this (around 5 hours or more) You should rather buy BOTW or Mario O, overall a good game with a little bit more content, but, that's what you should expect from a port....",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

XV_,08-09-2019,"For a single-player perspective Mario Kart 8 Deluxe can be a little plain in terms of unlocking things, but this game is not designed for that (all tracks and characters are unlocked from start but you can unlock a lot of karts and parts) its designed for you to play it locally with friends (or online maybe) and in that regard MK8D excels. There's a lot of options and courses that and in top of that, you still can mirror all those tracks and give a somewhat new feeling to them. The kart customization it's very good, so you can race at your own pace and style. One of the aspects that I really like was the music, its just amazing and sets the mood perfectly. There are a lot of tweaks that make the game feel well balanced in regards of which items you can get depending on your place, also the punishment for falling from the road or getting hit is not as punishing so its not that hard to make a comeback and maintains the races very fast-paced as it should be.

Beano12,16-11-2018,"IT’S LIKE IT’S NOT A PORT AND INSTEAD A WHOLE NEW GAME. That’s how great this entry is. The sheer amount of courses (all very good, different and appealing) and characters (a few are useless excuses, but otherwise the character roster is understandable) is amazing. The mechanics are intuitive as always, and the controls are solid. The toy con implementation is innovative. One complaint is that you shouldn’t play in table top mode; either have 1 foot between you and the console, have multiplayer, or get tunnel vision. That doesn’t make my score lower, though. If you have a switch, pick up this truly definitive version of Mario Kart",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Willduffy,10-12-2018,"I've only ever played the Mario kart DS and Mario kart 7 games, but Mario kart is my second favourite Nintendo series out there. I saw this game and instantly bought the game, and this was the actual reason for why I bought a switch. Then it was time to play it.
Positives:
-The graphics are beautiful and all tracks have some kind of appeal to me.
-The controls are so smooth and amazing.
-The battle mode is outstanding, especially compared to Mario kart 8.
-The new characters are all great, and it was clever putting Gold Mario as a skin.
-The double item feature and new items are genius and improve the general game play drastically.
-The purple drift is amazing, and is a good replacement for the power hopping of Mario kart 8.
Negatives
-I can tell that this game is way too similar to the Wii U version. There are ZERO new tracks which is a huge problem.
-They could've added more characters, and they should've removed some of the stupid characters like ""Pink Gold Peach"" and ""Baby Rosalina"".
-The coin is still here. Even if they created the double item it is still there and as annoying as before.

Even if the negatives are very annoying problems, this game is still outstanding and is one of the best sellers of the Nintendo Switch.

The battle mode from the Wii U version has been COMPLETELY fixed, and is now a regular mode I visit. There are a few new characters brought back, including the DLC characters from Wii U. The soundtrack is still awesome. You get all the DLC content as I mentioned that appeared in the Wii U version. There are oodles of tracks to now choose from. The online COULD have a little more variety, like what Wii did with its special challenges. If you did get everything for the Wii U version of this game, the full price tag will definitely put you off.

Akira_The_Kat,12-02-2020,"It's just as fun as it's always been. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is one of the best multiplayer games on the Switch. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the biggest installment in the franchise, with a plethora of characters that span across the Mario universe to more out of left field picks such as Link from The Legend of Zelda to the Inklings from Splatoon to even Villager and Issabell from Animal Crossing. But the gameplay is still as fun and chaotic as it has always been since the original. With classic items from the Mario franchise such as green shells, red shells, and bananas, to new items like the super horn, allowing you to blast away nearby opponents or even the pesky blue shell. The game provides the most amount of tracks in any game with twelve cups to race on, each with four tracks, adding up to a total of 48 tracks. And it doesn't stop with just the tracks, the game also provides you with many body frames, tires, and gliders for you to use, with a total of 78 unique vehicle parts ranging from bikes and karts to even real life vehicles such as GLA and BMW. But overall this game will provide you with many laughs and good times when you and a few friends get together with one another or online.

I paesaggi fuori dai circuiti sono ben curati, spesso viene voglia di uscire dalla strada per esplorarli. Per quanti riguarda i minigiochi, sono belli ma non divertenti come quelli sulla Wii, e ci sono anche meno zone rispetto a quest'ultima: mi sarei aspettato di ritrovarmi gli scenari della Wii, come la roulette.

IkOzael,27-12-2020,"I've had more fun overall in Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart Wii which I'll be comparing 8 to. I'm a guy who leans on the ""quality over quantity"" standard, so with that I say this game ain't all that. The masses say it's the best, but they either haven't played the ones I mentioned or say it's the best because new.

First of all, MK8D's track choices are pretty bland to me, especially some o' the older tracks that were remade. Speaking of older tracks, look what they did to Toad's Turnpike and Yoshi's Valley! The character roster is pretty stupid too. Like, why isn't every clone grouped together like Yoshi and Shy Guy's color variants? And who the hell is Pink Gold Peach?! Sounds like some cringey FanFiction love interest for Metal Mario.

Also, I swear the COMs are rubberbanding... again. If they really are, why? The game already relies on chance and what kart/bike setups you use, so trying to add other **** doesn't add difficulty when it's already random. While I'm at it, I'll talk about the mechanic changes 'cause now it really feels like a toddler fest. For example, remember when the Blue Shell would slow you down significantly since it launched you high in the air on hit? And in a few games, it was possible to escape it (although very hard to do)? Well in this game, it's about as inconvenient as the other shells and inescapable.

Anyway, I don't really play battle mode all that much 'cause there aren't that many maps to play on and the item roster leaves a lot to be desired. It does feel stale dealing with the same small pool of items, especially when they're place-dependent. Off the top of my head, you could've added missing items from the past games (except for ones like the Banana Bunch from MK64), character-specific items with unique effects, and some of the items from the Mario Kart Arcade games. Maybe that's too much for general gameplay. Too chaotic. Well, how about limiting some items to certain tracks? That'll give more of a reason to play those tracks aside from their layout and design.

Aside from racing and battle mode, there's nothing else like missions from Mario Kart DS or a ""Double Dash"" mode where you can pair up with someone to race together. Double Item Boxes are already in the game. Why wasn't that a thing?",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Minimik75,20-01-2022,"I'm gonna try to be as genuine as possible with this review. I looked at a couple of the other positive reviews by viewers, and most of them were strictly praising the gameplay. While that's obviously the aspect of Mario Kart that most people only care about, and I also agree that it's incredible and that I'm glad that it was made so much more fluent and easy to pick up and play, I'm just gonna say that this game is also amazing in its graphics, sound, and animation departments. Actually, before I go on with that, I'm gonna give a shoutout to the battle mode real quick, they really made me forget the sh**hole that it was on the Wii U with so many cool and creative arenas (I especially love the Wuhu Island one), even though I still like just playing normal races most of the time. Anyway, OHMYGOSH this game's music. From jazzy remixes to the new fully orchestrated soundtrack, it sounds and feels amazing on your ears, and makes the game just feel so alive and full of energy. I literally still listen to this game's soundtrack to this day, from the catchy jingles from some tracks like Shy Guy Falls and Moo Moo Meadows and also the ear candy that comes from some of the GC remixes and also N64 Rainbow Road, it's just so epic man. The title theme having the original SNES Mario Kart theme in it is really cool as well. It feels so genuine and like the composers of this game had so much fun while making it. Music Park too, I just love it so much. Now don't get me wrong, I also love the nostalgic music of older Mario Kart games like Mario Kart Wii, but this game's soundtrack just makes it seem like it's the ultimate Mario Kart game. For graphics and animation, oh good Lord is this game utilizing its hardware so well. It feels like more than just a Wii U port for some reason. And all the characters are so expressive, I don't really mind the overwhelming quantity of characters, I'd just say that the next Mario Kart game should definitely tone it down a bit (I'm looking at you, Mario Kart Tour.) Oh yeah and the anti gravity gimmick is sorta cool as well, it does make for some very cool camera angles sometimes I guess, I don't really have anything else to say about it. Oh yeah, the racetrack selection is also so fun and diverse, and I wasn't disappointed with any of the new tracks, but some I definitely like more than others.

nochianand,10-02-2020,"Gameplaywise, this is probably my favorite Mario Kart. Everything flows really nice and the huge amount of cars and bikes allows you to play how you want to. But still, I do have some criticism for this game. First the item system. You can hold two items at once, however, you cannot switch between them. It's really frustrating having to waste your first item just to use the second one. I also think this game missed a big opportunity to bring back all the courses and drivers just like Smash Ultimate did. The last thing I'd like to address is the lack of singleplayer content.

Mario Kart 8 Deluxe brings some minor tweaks to gameplay that make an outsized improvement over the original Wii U version, restoring some of the tactical range of expression that was lost with 8's item system. Performance is flawless, and the racing experience is enjoyable whether in single player, multiplayer, or online modes. The only real stain on this title is the environmental complexity it inherited from Mario Kart 7 and 8, with hang gliding and underwater and anti-gravity driving seeming an overbearing attempt to bludgeon the player with novelty in a title that doesn't need it. The game's incredible variety of 48 maps and near-endless character and vehicle customization offer plenty of range without the need for frenetic and constant changes to the racing environment.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
f1o_o1f,09-08-2020,"While it looks the best, it is far from being the best Mario Kart.
The content is lacking (battle mode?) and the physics might be the worst yet (seriously completely useless engine that would kill any other franchise but because it's Mario Kart it doesn't matter...)

For playing with friends, I would easily pick Mario Kart DS or Wii over this one. While both have their problems, they seem to be a lot better engineered while 8 Deluxe feels rushed and superficial.

Online is okay for what it is (the nintendo-switch-online service sadly is really bad but that's not the game's fault) but there are way too few options to customize a game or to set the maps. Playing with friends is annoying as hell for they just do not give a damn about online play at nintendo.

It is overall really sad to see Nintendo becoming this very distanced company in regard to long-time fans and general communication. I really hope they get to feel some sort of punishment in coming years but I doubt it.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

SirSoil,28-02-2020,"Mario Kart 8 Deluxe truly adds everything from new game modes and all the past paid DLC are back and free sadly some of the new features ruin the game. Now don’t get me wrong the racing feels nice so are the tracks, however they added another slot for items meaning you can have two items at once that might sound good but it’s not. It makes the game more chaotic hard and mainly annoying. The battle modes are still a blast even the new unique modes they added actually fit the larger maps which was a problem in the last game. The character and track roster is outstanding so many things to chose from, the online is good it does what it does well. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe adds so much that is awesome from new stuff to great returning additions, I just wish if they didn’t ruin the main gameplay with the items yes you can turn them off but it ruins the magic of Mario Kart.

JoeQ_,24-03-2020,"Mario Kart 8: Deluxe may be a port of the game from the Wii U, but that does not undermine what it brings from the table in terms of new additions. Deluxe adds all DLC in the original game unlocked and available, a brand-new refined battle mode with great maps; both new and classics, and a brand new double-item system to make the game crazier and fun for all. Giving Switch owners the opportunity to own an amazing game that they may have not owned before is a great move by Nintendo. Everything that makes Mario Kart is here and is improved upon. There are a few nitpicks I have with the game, however, such as the Blue shell being able to hit every player and not just those in first & a lackluster roster of characters to choose from. The game's modes stemming from Grand Prix, Versus, Battle Mode, Local & Online Multiplayer, and Time Trials are all great and keep the game replayable and great for parties.

Baltifru,25-04-2020,"It is the good old Mario Kart, but honestly it does not deserve an overwhelmingly positive global opinion.

First thing first: why can't the Switch get an exclusive Mario Kart ? We're talking about the port of a Wii U game from 2014, still sold full price in 2020. That's a shame.

Second: I have played Mario Kart DS A LOT (more than a 1000 hours) and thoroughly enjoyed it. I played the Wii version as well, but none since them. After all these years, I regret that Mario Kart has not managed to evolve so much. Still the same game modes and nothing new in the gameplay. It seems that each episode just brings a few new races, a few new characters and episodically, new objects, but that's it. And even with this in mind, it worries me to see that Nintendo has to go and get characters/levels from its other licenses to bring something new, a sign that good old Mario cannot renew the concept of his karting game by himself.

Obviously MK8D remains a very good game, hence the 8 score, but it bothers me than this license I love so much can't innovate.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It’s got quite a wide variety of choices for everything, the controls are very solidified (if you don’t have awful Joy-Cons), there’s a lot of battle mode choices, and overall, it’s fun to pick up and play whenever. The only downsides are that the battles modes feel a little watered down compared to the older versions of battle they came from, and the Wi-Fi is definitely janky, but that’s more a system issue.

A todo esto podemos añadir la portabilidad del título, que aun no formando parte del juego como tal, es un muy buen incentivo para jugadores que apenas puedan jugar en sus casas.

Sasarai,20-06-2020,"Mario Kart Deluxe is an improved version of the previous editions. It is certainly one of the best if not the best of the franchise. However it is worth to notice that there are a few flaws in the gameplay, specifically in online racing. Online, races become too item heavy which leaves no room to actual good driving and/or individual skills. Also, item apparition is quite unbalanced. This makes the game somewhat frustrating and annoying to play. Near the finish line, races become more like a random battlefield than an actual interesting race. It is a shame. Lastly, they could systematically include more circuits. Once one has played them a few times, the game becomes repetitive.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Nunca te vas a aburrir jugando a este juego (y menos si lo haces con amigos). Cada mapa, cada vehículo, cada personaje y cada powerus son únicos, dotando a cada uno de ellos de una gran personalidad. El multijugador también va muy bien: sin lagazos, como en otros juegos de Switch, y con una matchmaking correcto. Los únicos ptoblemas que le veo al juego son quizas los escasos modos de juego, la escasez de mapas tras bastantes horas de juego y que no se haya añadido prácticamente nada con respecto a la versión de Wii U.

Gontrand00,13-02-2021,"This is a good MK game. It has great control, easy to learn and it must be really cool to play with other people, almost as much as Double Dash. But sadly the game has several flaws that restrain it from being a 10.

-50cc and 100cc and much to easy, especially for a veteran player who did every MK games
-150cc and 200cc are almost unfair in some ways, since you pretty much always have a race where you get hit by a blue shell 2 seconds before the finish line, get passed by 1-2 or 3 others players and then your score is **** It's sincerely systematic. When you go through every 12 cups, it happens at least once per cup. So since I gave up doing the 100% thing with 3 stars everywhere, I don't really give a damn anymore, but for anyone who tries to do it perfectly, it's gonna be a frustrating experience since this gimmick make the game much harder than it should be.

-There is also a weird mechanic in the game where if you tend to get out a little out of the path, it forced you to go back on track. It's subtle, but thing can ruin races. It literally happened to me on a race where I wanted to do a short curve drift, and it suddenly shifted to make me take a shortcut I couldn't take because I didn't have a boost. So I fell in the water for no reason and it was (of course) on the last turn. It doesn't happen quite often, but this feels like this mechanics was integrated in the game so beginner players wouldn't constantly fly off road, which can be OK if you are on assist-mode, but never on a full speed mode. It kinda crushes the point since you feel you cannot your kart perfectly.

-Also too bad some items are gone because it feels less diversified (after 36 cups).

-They literally changed some races from the past, which is not really a nice hommage since it blow up the point of taking old tracks. I'm not talking about bugs, but about some things that made those races unique. Yoshi's valley is a great exemple. On the N64 version, you could never know who was first during the race because the icon were all switched up with ? marks. Which gave so much suspens and made that race unforgettable. This was took out in the Switch version, which is kinda sad and less exciting.

You feel that's a really good game with great quality, but the laziness of Nintendo (as usual) to do a deluxe version instead of a new one, and the poor additions or changes they did, doesn't really gives a nice picture of the game.

So it's worth a good 8, but far behind what it could have been (which feels like a bad habits Nintendo seem to have with their AAA games).",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

BeeSting1,01-01-2021,"Visually exillerating.

Good

- graphics look great. Tracks look beautiful, which makes racing exillerating visually.

- smart steering is good for casual players, and kids.

- tricks are fun to do. Ramps were nicely placed to string in multiple trick boosts.

- 200cc introduces drift braking which adds a new dimension to the gameplay.

- a lot of car parts.

- blue shell counter is a great addition.

- you recover more quickly when falling off which keeps the pace.

Bad

- unwanted speed boosts from collision with opponents. It makes me fall off the edge sometimes in 200cc. It's completely out of my control because the opponent comes from behind.

- fat characters block my view sometimes

- no way to practice tracks in 200cc tracks. Only option is to split screen, which is lame.

- no button remap makes 200cc awkward, since I have to use Y to accelerate to feel comfortable, but it also requires rewiring. Remap would have been easy fix.

Inorde,22-01-2021,"The perfect culmination of all things Mario Kart. There is a LOT of content in this game and all the tracks are beautifully crafted. Game-play is flawless. It's a good example of easy to learn, hard to master. My children play 50cc with steering assistance. Personally I'm trying to conquer the golden items and that is a tough challenge even after 75 hours of play. Yes, some luck is involved to finish a cup with 3 stars, although with enough skill you can get ahead far enough to make it to 1st place even if several hits slow you down. The web is full of tips and tricks to improve your driving and tactics.

The performance is good. A stable 60fps. The only problem here is 3 or more players. The screen will split in 4 then and frame-rate will be capped at 30fps. It's doable but the difference with 60fps is huge.

On-line play is plain and simple and a lot of fun. I haven't spend a lot of time doing battles though.

One side note: this is an updated version of the Wii U game + DLC. If you already own that there is not much to gain here, although playing this in handheld mode is perfectly doable.

The blue shell is still cursed as well as other items, but when you fall behind in racing games, it can get really hard to catch up, so Mario Kart tries to balance that out.

Not only that, but it is also my favorite game of all time, although I do not get to play it much. Although the Wii U version had a Battle Mode as interesting as watching paint dry, the Switch version spices it up with not one, not two, but FIVE options, and all are as cool as one another. And the added guide helps players to better understand the game and how to play it. But I've saved the best for last, the music and racetracks. Not only do the racetracks keep you on your toes, but the music only adds to the ""I must win"" vibe.

I've never been good with racing game and Mario Kart is the hardest I've ever played yet but It's the only game that makes me keep going back. Usually I drop any racing game after 2-4 race but with Mario Kart, something grab me for good.

It's very challenging when you are at the top 3 and the game is very forgiving and supportive at the same time for anyone that got left behind. They design the tracks pretty good as I need to replay it several time to know when is the right time to drift or even for a short brake.

They added Bowser Jr, Dry Bones and King Boo who were missing in the last game, but still no Birdo or Diddy Kong who should have been brought back from the beginning. Still that is an improvement to the character roster. This game is pretty much Mario Kart 8 but better.

soot103,30-04-2022,"I don't even know where to start with this game. First of all, this game looks pronominal for such a small console. Each of the new tracks are unique and beautiful, each with their own gameplay styles and design. The game is a port of the Wii U game, but it has been improved on in multiple parts. When you enter Grand Prix, all the characters are unlocked, which is nice for players who grinded for characters in any of the previous games for hours and hours. All the cups are unlocked from the start, which is strange, since all previous games require you to unlock the other cups. The issue I have with gameplay are the new features added intended to help more casual players have a more enjoyable time. These features are Smart Steering and Auto Accelerate, which could be turned off, but makes the game feel simpler and easier to beat, instead of feeling like an actual challenge to get 1st place. Other than that, the gameplay feels identical to 8, which isn't, bad, but also got some improvements with better item roulette and the ability to hold 2 items and get double item boxes, originating from double dash.

KipKebab,21-07-2022,"The best Mario Kart game in the series.
From the incredible track design to the graphics, the game is great. The item balance is good, but it could use more variety. It has a whopping 48 tracks, the most in the series. And now they are adding 48 new tracks in the form of paid dlc. They don't look great but are fun regardless.

The game's main gimmick is anti gravity. Anti gravity may not seem like that big of a deal, but it allows for crazy good track design.

The roster is big. There's some questionable characters in it (Pink Gold Peach and Baby Rosalina to be specific) but it's overall solid. I love the inclusion of the Koopalings!

Kinda sad to see some low scores by people who think the AI is cheating while this game is definitely one of the easiest in the series. If you want a challenge though, you can hop into multiplayer.

There's a lot of content and variety. You can play this game for many hours and not get bored of it. There's 5 different battle modes to enjoy. A big improvement on the previous games.

CorgiWithAMouth,09-08-2022,"In the past couple few years we've seen many good racing games. Forza Horizon, Grand Turismo, F1 these are all amazing franchises with realistic looking cars and mechanics bellowed by players. Well....... I don't like any of them. And the reason why, is that I suck at racing games. But ... there is one exception Mario kart. Even though I enjoy playing it with my friends, family, Jim Jon Un and Donald Trump I'm still gonna **** about it for the next 5 minutes.

So Mario kart 8 deluxe is the latest release in the franchise and first of all, it is amazing how simplistic they made everything for new comers. Ask anyone that doesn't play video games what game have they played and there gonna probably say mario kart. A big contributing factor to that is the ""I'm a **** setting"". Turning this on will not let you fall of the map. So basically you can just hold gas and play. This might sound dumb as **** but.... lets say your playing with your little brother, or your trying to get your girlfriend in to gaming or your doing hard drugs so the screen keeps moving around on the wall and you keep falling off of rainbow road so you just say **** it.....

Before even starting a race you have an option to choose a character and parts for your vehicle. As simple as this is, it does pack a huge impact on the game. If you play on 50cc, get that full speed baby, but if you playing on 200cc yeah get that **** speed out my face I need some acceleration so I can strat driving after hitting the wall for the 90th time.

The modes are lacking. Well at least in the single player department. Compared to other entries before it, Mario kart 8 lakhs a story mode or single player challenges. I remember the ds missions in Mario kart ds, which as a kid, just gave you something to do on a car ride. Mario kart 8 you won't be playing this game much by yourself.

My biggest issue with the game is item balancing. Now you have two item slots. And yes, you can get two sets of three red shells. Now imagine how absolutely ****ing herendes it is to get hit by that. In the end of a gaming session with your friends you go from best buds to ""You ****ing piece of **** ; ""Another red shell you **** hole"" ; ""I'll kill your family and make you watch"" ; ""I hope hitler will be ****ing you once you go to hell""

The maps are in my opinion a nice mix up. You have some old cl****ics and some new whipper snapper that will become old cl****ics when the next game comes out. The best map is Big Blue cuzzz uhuhuhuhu ....... The timer starts ticking down. 3... 2... 1... and your emidietly blasted forward with boost pads already under you and then you have these slick turns and and then music goes like dan .. dan dan .. dan.. dan dan ..... this my jam map.

So how good was Mario kart 8 deluxe actually? If you have a group of friends you love playing with, it's a must buy. Even if you'll end up screeming at eachother and the **** you'll still have a blast. It's a 8/10. for sure.

Ow one more thing. Nintendo this is a 5 year old game, which is a port of Mario kart 8 from 2014 released on the Wii U. Can it not be 60$ anymore? Come on, daddy has to pay rent somehow.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MWD2490,05-12-2011,I liked Mario Kart DS and Wii a lot. This game has the playing style of the DS Version but the graphics of the Wii version. It also takes some of the game mechanics of the Wii but has more of the elements that were in the DS version. It takes a lot from the previous versions of Mario Kart which is a good thing and it does not change much of the formula. I like the additions and the characters that are in the game. The online multiplayer is really good and I hope to use it a lot in the future. One of the best Mario Karts to date.,10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

mdwilsonbsc,11-12-2011,"Above all else, Mario Kart 7 is about fun. You can pick it up for 5 minutes or play it for hours and, all the way through, you'll be enthralled.
Most noticeable about the graphics is the animation which is really quick to give a smooth, solid feel, finished off with plenty of detail and good use of colour.
The use of gyro-controls feels reminiscent of steering wheel controls on the Wii which is a great addition to get you more ""into"" the game.
It's fine to work through the single player modes, but the game is harder to put down when you play over the internet. Racing can be frustrating at times but it is so addictive that you are sure to come back to it once you've calmed down!

maddymarie,01-01-2013,"In comparison to it's predecessors, Mario Kart 7 does a fantastic job of knocking them off course via blue shell. The many different courses that could be selected, the kart customization, the new characters; it all was a thrilling ride.. While it lasted, which wasn't very long. I had high expectations when it came to this specific Mario Kart, and to be honest, it didn't live up to what I thought it would. Nintendo had so many opportunities to change things up with Mario Kart 7. A good portion of the game, felt recycled to me. Although it was nice to have many different courses to choose from, many of them were from previous titles in the series. The character roster also felt very small - and I've unlocked every playable character. It would have been great to see new play modes as well. The coin collection and balloon battle modes are quite fun, however it would've been really nice if Nintendo had of added at the very least one extra mode. To end my review, I say that this game is worth purchasing, if you don't mind playing through some of the old courses, or are new to the series.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
muzziklover,23-01-2012,"This is probably going to be a tradition of mine. Whenever there is a new Nintendo handheld console, I would probably always get a Mario Kart game and Mario Kart 7 is the first 3DS game I've ever got my hands on. Being the successor to Mario Kart DS, the best if not, one of the best Mario Kart games ever, consider me a bit disappointed. Mario Kart 7 is a good game by all means but it's a a step down from Mario Kart DS. Let's talk about the good things first. The gameplay is still as solid as any Mario Kart game, you can now customize your own kart, the track selection is excellent, they fixed the rubberband AI from Mario Kart Wii (thank god) and the multiplayer is as good or maybe even better than Mario Kart Wii's multiplayer. The big problem with this game is the content. Mario Kart DS' biggest high point was the high amounts of content it offered and being a generation ahead of MKDS, Mario Kart 7 should've done more and it's the same story all over again with the content issues of New Super Mario Bros. Wii where Nintendo are just being damn lazy. To be fair, I guess I'm judging this game by the standards of what made Mario Kart DS so perfect but MKDS was a generation behind and Mario Kart 7 is in a brand new generation. It needs to be bigger, it needs something new and it needs to have more than its predecessors offered. Gliding and going under water is not going big, Nintendo. Overall, it's still a solid Mario Kart game but for the love of god, try harder Nintendo.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
IrishChai,19-07-2012,"It's hard not to like this game. The levels are well done (and taken from all the other mario karts to date) and all of the races are fun to play hundreds of times with different shortcuts and tricks to each map. It's very entertaining gameplay long after you know the course like the back of your hand. That's a hard feat to keep something interesting after you've raced it to death over and over, but Nintendo definitely achieved that goal. There is a ton of unlockables, and an excellent multiplayer design on top of the time it will take you to win all the races in single player with a 3-star gold cup achievement. Even then, you'll get a whole new challenge unlocked in the mirror mode. The few side games included in the package are somewhat entertaining too, although I didn't really enjoy them personally and don't plan to spend any more time in them. I think I will enjoy hopping online for a race or try and beat the fastest times in the player ghost races for a long time to come.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Umaro67,27-12-2011,"The very best Mario Kart ever made, if not the most original or exciting. A ten out of ten means a perfect execution of concepts with no visible flaws, and that's exactly what MK7 is. This entry has the best physics, the best track design, the best balance and the best controls. Instead of breaking down the pros and cons, I will simply dissect the pros due my lack of conviction in the existence of any flaws. The overall presentation: it's essentially Mario Kart Wii, very similar menus and layout. This is idea, as Mario Kart Wii had the best layout and menus of any Mario Kart game. The online menus and functionality is also largely identical to MKWii, except with a few new features like communities or groups or whatever they're called, I wasn't terribly interested in that kind of stuff. The real meat and potatoes are the raw elements, and this where the game is unstoppable. The tracks in this entry were designed in collaboration with Retro Studios, who if you are not familiar are among the most consistently fantastic level designers in the world. MK7 does not disappoint. Tracks are sharp, engaging, surprising, and layered. The new layers often come in the form of aquatic and aerial sections in which you race in floaty underwater physics or very different hang gliding segments. I cannot stress how much these new sections actually add to the game. On the surface they may strike you as simply being minor distractions, until you discover that you can pull off absurd drifting techniques underwater and that your technique in the air allows you to create your own little shortcuts, soaring past foes on the ground with the right movements through the air and evasion of obstacles. When the tires hit the road again, it's Mario Kart at it's finest. The silky-smooth controls, performance and surprisingly slick circle pad leave every element of manipulation behind. I found myself completely immersed and engaged with the experience, as I frantically evaded green shells, made breath-stopping drifts along the edges of demise in Neo Bowser City and exploited nifty and treacherous shortcuts on Wuhu Island (but no glitching, shame on you!). The drifting is, I guess for a lack of better term, deep and satisfying. The items are all over the place and constantly bring the random chaos to the table while still allowing skill to be the defining pillar in your success....almost all the time. The 3D effect is both profound and subtle. It's essentially perfect, because it doesn't distract or define the experience but adds something foundational to the experience. It's kind of a paradox. I really like the 3D and use it 100% of the time with very little strain or discomfort, and I often have both of those problems with 3D. So in short: use it. The Characters and karts are all largely the same as before except now you can swap out tires with your kart, it's not terribly exciting but does allow for greater customization over your ride than any other Mario Kart which lends itself to more strategies than before, like taking advantage of the ""off-road"" portions of the track design which is more pronounced in this iteration than any other. Another aspect of the track design that I found fun were the single-lap super tracks, adding some variety and a new spin on rainbow road, the rainbow road in MK7 is also the best version yet with more layers to its design. Overall, I can only attempt to recommend this game enough to any fan of racing games or Mario Kart. There's certainly a sensation of deja-vu coming off of Mario Kart Wii, but the execution is in top form. The worst thing I can say about Mario Kart 7 is that it makes all the other ones irrelevant.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

D-Lew,30-12-2011,"Outstanding Mario Kart title, and a much needed big name title for the 3DS that lives up to its reputation. Mario Kart 64 still takes the title of my favorite Mario Kart, but this is a very close second. The visuals are spot-on perfect, sounds and music are nice, and the controls are very precise and easy. The online racing feature is really fun and great, with the exception of the interface. I wish it had a ""party system"" for joining races with friends, and I'm sad there isn't a voice chat feature between even registered friends. Instead, it's oversimplified to make everything easy, while making joining your friends a little difficult. You can create your own groups and invite your friends only to make it easier to race with them, but unless you have lots of friends playing all at once you cannot participate in the 8-player races this way. The new items are pretty fun, but I miss the fake item boxes and Boo. I feel some of the character selection could have been better as well. Kart customization adds a nice personal and strategic touch to the game, and I love several of the designs. Single player will still enrage you if you are trying for 3 star ratings in each cup, as you will always get hit with a blue shell seconds before you cross the finish line. I have had lots of fun racing against time trial ghosts with Spotpass and trying to beat the bell curve of record times and set ""perfect"" laps - unfortunately the area I live isn't very 3DS active, so I haven't been able to try the StreetPass features.

One is the Lucky 7 which allows for the usage of the 7 items in the game (this really isn't overpowered though), the Fire Flower (which is really a refined version of the fireballs in Double Dash), and the Tanooki Tail (which is useful for collecting coins that you cannot just reach, stopping the weaker items from affecting you and close range attacks).

Aouzy,12-02-2012,"Well, i actually thought all the rumors about this game being best in the series was true. MKW was bad and i thought this was going to redeem it. But no, this is just as bad. Here are some pros and cons

Pros: Kart customization, Better online and communities, some great tracks like Neo Bowser City, better retro courses, blue shell problem is fixed (It used to be 3-5 a race in MKW, now it's 1-3)

Cons: The Fireflower item which is very unfair and you get it around 2nd place. Very small and tight courses. The Maka Wuhu glitch that noobs do online. Very short Rainbow Road. 100cc isn't needed unless you want gold wheels. Bad characters, don't even try doing the first 3 retro courses on 150cc. And a lot more item abuse than MKW.

There's less content in this game than in Mario Kart DS. The removed the ability to add an emblem to your kart, they left out the single player missions and mot of the tracks are old ones. If I wanted to play old tracks I'd play the old Mario Kart games. It just feels lazy. I do however like how they added the ability to customize your kart. That's a really neat feature but they don't quite explain how you unlock different parts well. It's also pretty nice to just go into the water to drive or glide across the skies. It feels different which is neat, but there should've been more of these segments in my opinion. Overall, despite my disappointment with somethings I think anybody with a 3DS should but this game.

MANU3L69,03-02-2012,"Although a seasoned player can easily get through all the cups in a day, Mario Kart 7 is a great game, and among the best in the 3DS lineup. I have to say, I've played several Mario karts and they just don't seem to change much in almost anyway. It's honestly like Call of Duty. You can't wait to see the new graphics, or the new roster or the new amazing courses they have set up for you. Honestly, it's a love it or hate it type of thing. If you like the formula and you just want new maps and racers, then this game will more than satisfy you. On the other hand, if you think each Mario Kart is too similar and you think it's become a bore, then you should probably pass. That being said, I would like to just say what I like and dislike about the game. First off, I love the graphics and controls. At first, the driving feels a bit weird, but once you get used to it, you'll be zipping through the maps with ease. I also love the gliding and the underwater parts on each map. They make it more dynamic and more atmospheric. The game is colorful and bright but also dark in some areas as well. I also found that the 16 old maps are actually revamped and some even seem like totally different maps. The 16 new maps are amazing, my favorite being Rock Rock Mountain or Wario Shipyard. There are 32 maps, and all of them are fun to play on. The multiplayer is rock solid as well. It's fleshed out pretty well and there's almost no lag to worry about. The things I dislike are the AI and that goddamn blue shell. The AI in 150cc are pretty difficult to overcome and the blue shell almost always hits me on the last lap. These are old problems that Mario Kart fans should come to terms with however. Overall, it's a great racing game, with a decent roster, really fun courses, solid online multiplayer and good graphics. I recommend this to any 3DS owner who likes Mario Kart remotely.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
BlogDog123,27-01-2012,"This is the second best Mario Kart game to date (Mario Kart 64 is still the best). The wide selection of new and retro tracks are teeming with details, and the 3D really brings the game to life. Also innovating for the franchise is customizable karts; something I hope Nintendo will do for future Mario Kart titles.

buellerbueller,27-12-2011,"Though this game has its flaws, which I'll explain in a minute, this is probably the most thought-out Mario Kart ever (even the title has a reason for being ""Mario Kart 7""). My first criticism is that the action is slow. I'm driving my kart around, and it seems like I'm going under the speed limit. Also, the characters are quite aggressive, and the result is one too many hits with a Red Shell. Speaking of power-ups, that's one of the best parts. With the new 7 power-up, you can use 7 objects at once! I also love the beautiful and well-built tracks, specifically the Pirahna Plant track in the Star Cup. I love the glory of unlocking a new customization to your kart when you get a certain number of coins (the coins are actually new to the series.) I love these features, but the heavily-promoted abilities of flying and underwater driving are the sole power of the game. If only they could use more of this feature. I hope that the flying and underwater driving aren't shelved, like the two-person kart in Double Dash!! Overlooking the flows and frustration, this might be the best Mario Kart game.

cub317,26-12-2011,"Mario Kart 7 is another very good entry into the Mario Kart series. The graphics of this game are among the best on the 3DS, and the game is very fun too. In this game, you can create your own kart to suit your needs, and go out to win a Grand Prix. There are a few new gimmicks to note as well. There are hang gliders now, which allow you to glide in the air, and you can now go underwater. Both of these gimmicks make the game far more interesting. The new courses have been created specifically so you can get a feeling for both gimmicks. The controls of this game are no different from any other Mario Kart game, and that's another thing that makes this game great. The graphics of this game are very bright and colorful. By 3DS standards, they're amazing. However, there are also a few criticisms to this game. The first thing is that there is no versus mode. This made me very disappointed because that was my favorite mode of the regular DS version. In versus mode, you were able to start your own Grand Prix, and choose the settings to fit your needs. You could choose the A.I. level, the rules, the engine size, the number of races needed to win, and whether or not you want a team. The 3DS version doesn't have this. It probably has it in multiplayer only now, but I don't play the game on multiplayer so this is a let down for me. Also, the game may have a customizable car, but the rest of the options are limited to what you can change within the game. The rest of the game more than makes up for this short-coming. However, if I had to pick a favorite, I'm afraid I'll have to say that Mario Kart DS is better than Mario Kart 7. Mario Kart DS has more customizable options, has a versus mode, and still stays true to the Mario Kart formula. Mario Kart 7 is a very good game overall, but if you want something better, buy Mario Kart DS instead.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Happymonk,29-02-2012,"Mario Kart 7 is quite possibly the best Mario Kart game yet! All of the tracks are great fun, with some I can see being all time classic tracks in the future. There is a lot to do in the game but it's lacking the mission mode from Mario Kart DS. All in all I'd say the gameplay is brilliant and is the best I've seen in a Mario Kart game to date, the items are reasonably well balanced (they've improved the Blue Shell this time!) although the two new items seem a little pointless, I'm sure nobody actually hates them. Now, the inclusion of gliding is very good and I really hope it stays, it feels as though it has been pulled straight from Pilotwings 3D! the underwater sections don't really add a lot to the overall experience, but I wouldn't complain if they ever returned. The ONLY problem with this game is its character roster, it doesn't feel like it has enough, 17 in all, and its missing a couple of Mario Kart essential characters (WALUIGI!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and Baby Mario), don't get me wrong, the characters that are there are all good (yes, I don't mind the Honey Queen or Metal Mario) but it's just oddly missing the two characters I've already mentioned. And for that reason Mario Kart 7 is on about the same level of awesomeness as Wii, but 7 probably just edges it in fairness. If you own a 3DS, buy Mario Kart, it's one of those games that you'll still be playing a few years down the line, it won't disappoint!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
dharma,16-06-2012,"Mario Kart 7 is another must have title for the 3DS. They all feel the same, I know, but it's a game that really benefits a lot and fun to play during your traveling time. For once though, the rubber band AI is slightly 'toned down'; a more hardcore experience for the fans (and still accessible for casual gamers as well)",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Darkicicle,07-04-2013,"Although I am a bit late to review this and I got it first thing it was released, I am still going to.
It is a lot better looking than any other Mario Kart game although it is still the same base game there are many new tracks and lots of new features. I am glad there aren't bikes in this game and I like how they used the gyro/motion control of the 3DS and you can use it if you want to.
It is also nice that you can now use gliders in the game if you go on blue boosters, it is quite enjoyable and can sometimes show off a bit of the track. The coin system is allso interesting, you can get coins to speed you up more but it is only a small increase in the speed and coins contribute to some unlocks.
Although I don't think that half the game should be retro courses, I reckon it'd be better is there is only 4-6 of them.
The multiplayer either online or locally worked amazingly and had to be the best multiplayer out of all of the Mario Kart games. Although the friend code system can be a bit tedious and would be better if only one person needed to add you then you get a notification saying if you want to add them or not would be a lot better. Other than that it works quite well.
It is quite sad that they removed the VS mode where you can just race against CPU's as practice for Grand Prix's you can still use VS mode in multiplayer with a friend, but even without the VS mode for singleplayer I still enjoyed it a lot, even though there can be a bit of coin grinding here and there.
One final thing; the Streetpass/Spotpass features are quite good, you can race against people you saw online with their ghosts and people you pass by in Streetpass if they have the game and you can do other things too.
Overall great game and I'd definitely recommend this to anyone who'd like to try out a racing game for the 3DS or is a fan of Mario.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
hit925,01-01-2012,"It's Mario Kart, of course it's going to be good. The online is improved from MKWii and the communities are a good idea but could have been expanded. I think the new courses are mostly good, particularly the 1 lap Rainbow Road but some aren't the best. I saw no point in having two Wuhu island courses. The old courses also have some odd choices but are mostly good. The new changes are good but ultimately it is still good old Mario Kart.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kirisoul,09-01-2012,"This game has all the depth of a console mario kart on a handheld. The tracks are beautiful and detailed, the models are well rendered and simple but good refinements to the traditional formula make this a must own for 3DS. The fact that none of the new elements like kart customization and gliders feel fun instead of being gimmicks is more than you can say for most wii games already, and the multiplayer is simply astounding. Wifi is excellent, local multiplayer is great, you can even set up your own grand prix! Honestly, I don't see any other 3DS game matching this in quality except OoT 3D and maybe the upcoming Metal Gear Solid.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Leigh28,30-12-2011,"Am making this short and sweet review!

Game is a complete joy to play and with a wealth of options on display there always something to do!

Online is great as ever and there's a lot to unlock even in single player and new customize karts are plus !

Only bad thing is blue spikey shell is back and consistently ruins your races and sends you to last place which is frustrating!!! and possible worst item in whole game!!

Also were is donkey kong junior and dry bowser or dry bones? there are lots of characters missing from game which makes no sense! and is shame not seeing them included in MK7:(",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Djangolulu,26-12-2011,"What a fun game. Better visuals and a few new game mechanics continually push the Mario Kart series forward. Mario Kart 7 includes good 3D presentation, although its not really a necessary addition. The multiplayer is improved, but very often I found myself joining a lobby right as the race was starting, and having to sit through the entire duration of the race until I could actually play. All the chance and luck of Mario Kart is the same; you can be in first place for the whole race, and be bumped to last with an unfortunately timed blue shell and an enemy with star power bashing you off the track. Skill, while important, means next to nothing, and anyway, everyone is either a Japanese of European pro at Mario Kart, so the only variety is in the items. The Tanooki Suit and Fireball power-ups are the only new additions, and the sliding is different, but you'll get used to it. Mario Kart 7 is one of the must-have games for the 3DS, and you'll spend many hours racing on the new tracks. It proves that Mario Kart is always fun.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
DarkFlame16,11-02-2012,"A decent Mario Kart. It's not the best in the series, but, people will enjoy customizing their karts, driving underwater, and gliding through the air just to get that trophy waiting for them at the finish line. But, the thing that really pisses me off the fact that you can get hit with ANY shells in the air. Come on, really, it's bad enough that they do this on ground level, but, now they can do it in the air too?",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
MM64z,23-01-2012,"This is probably the best game in the series thus far. Mario Kart 7 makes full use of the 3DS's new abilities, such as complete 3D depth, stereo sound, gyro controls, and the wi-fi racing, not to mention this game's overall great track design and other stuff like that. I like the new characters introduced, especially. The picking of the retro tracks was well-done as well, although there are always still a few I wish they didn't choose. Its online multiplayer is great except for the fact that everyone keeps spamming this certain glitch on one of the courses. The ability to customize car parts is a big innovation, and so are the gliders, underwater driving, and first-person view. Like Mario Kart Wii, you can also tilt the 3DS using gyro controls to move the kart when you have first-person view enabled. Overall, Mario Kart 7 is a near-perfect game and I would recommend it to anyone who owns a 3DS.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
TomWutton,14-02-2012,"Still same old fun. Nice graphics, the personalization of karts is cool, and the 3 or 4 new track design (sectors instead of laps) is a really cool thing ! Online multiplayer is really well done (althought I wished we could race more than 8...). I have 2 complaints that refrein me from giving MK7 a 10 : the solo cups are way too easy at 50 and 100 CC; and the lack of a Challenge mode like in the DS version is unforgivable. All in all, its a must own for any 3DS gamer. Oh and by the way, the 1rst person **** view is a nice attemps, but hummm...No....Sorry it doesn't fit in the Mario Kart series.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
yoshikartguy,21-02-2012,"First off I just wanna say the game's graphics are amazing and are equally comparable to the Wii's (not like any system isn't though, right?) The Gameplay is enhanced from Mario Kart DS with the Circle Pad. The only negatives I find with this game are how useless/hard to use the online communities are, the lack of numerous battle stages (-looks at the sky- NINTENDO!!), stupendously boring battle, and lack of missions, single player vs. mode, etc. from Mario Kart DS and other Mario Kart Games. Overall, this game is amazing and is probably one of the best yet. However, Nintendo lacked in making this more of single player experience and overdid it on the multiplayer. Next time Nintendo... MAKE BALANCE XD

8/10 :)",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Mr_Critic,24-02-2012,"So i picked up a game called Mario Kart 7. First of all, i'm one of those guys who - of all Mario Kart games - liked Mario Kart 64 the most. I'm not a big fan of Mario Kart Wii, nor Mario Kart Double Dash (worst MK-Game in my eyes). Mario Kart DS was ok, but not at the same level Mario Kart 64 was back in the days. I'm sayin all that stuff to show that i was very sceptical at the beginning about this game. I seen the Trailers and the new stuff and thought that it could only go two ways: (A) Be very dissapointing OR (B) A welcomed upgrade to a legendary Kart racing game that made my childhood very entertaining when wheather wasn't the greatest and i had to stay at home. After several hours of playing this game i decided it was (B). The game has what made Mario Kart 64 so popular and didn't take stuff into the game that made other Mario Kart games terrible. It's the best Mario Kart in my opinion. So... jeah, i know i said Mario Kart 64 was the legend of all Mario Karts but this game is even better. My initial scepsis about the new stuff like cruisin' under water or flying in the air dissapeared really fast and transformed into the point that this is the stuff that makes this game so special and adorable. Another thing i noticed are some ""balance"" changes.

In Mario Kart DS it was possible to drive past the courses like a snake to get infinite boosts and even though u didn't drive the shortest possible route, u was faster than your opponents because u was always on that boost-mode. Asians were the most common guys to play like this. Mario Kart 7 cut that corner. It's not possible any more. Drifting is still a big part about this game, but its not faster to drive on a straight route like an S looks and be faster than a guy who just takes the shortest possible way. Conclusion: The graphics look sharp, the animations are great, the new items make sense and last but not least the courses are beautiful and great to play on. Hell yeah, even the hated ""Rainbow Boulevard"" isn't such a dissapointing route like it was on Mario Kart Wii. This game is the best Mario Kart u can get for money and the online mode is working very well too. To be honest i can't even think about a single bad thing in this game.

Thanks Ninetndo, you brought the game back to a guy who thought the series died after Mario Kart 64.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JakeWarburton,09-03-2012,"Good points:
-Fun gameplay
-Fun online, provided you don't get disconnected often like I do...
-Good replayability
-Kart customisation
-Different game modes. Grand Prix, Vs Race, Time trial, Coin battle, Balloon battle.
-Land, sea, air. You can be driving one minute and the next underwater with a propellor or gliding through the air.

Bad points:
-Blue shells got EVEN MORE annoying. Now they run along the road taking out people who aren't even in first.
-Rubber banding: Doesn't matter how skilled you are, they will always catch up. Some may call this fun, I call it a pain in the arse. When combined with homing shells, this can mean the difference between a clear win and coming in last. Seriously, I've been bombarded on the last race of a grand prix 10 meters before the finish line by 3 different CPU opponents and ended up coming next to last.
-Glitches. There are a couple of known glitches in races at the moment meaning what could have been your favourite track is now your worst nightmare. Nintendo are NOT patching this in order to ""keep things fair for early adopters vs. newcomers."" The game won't be going down in price any time soon so you might as well grab it if you plan on buying it.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
rubin,26-12-2012,"Wonderful! What I like best about this game that it stays true to the ""portable"" spirit. It's simply perfect for killing time between classes, in a bus, waiting in line for the doctor and the like. While this might make your ""casual radar"" go wild, make no mistake, MK7 is a very well crafted game with a strong multiplayer feature. Simply seeing the amount of detail put into the tracks makes my heart jump with joy. The racing mechanics are very good; the new gliding feature is super fun and works particularly well with the 3D (Alpine Pass is simply breathtaking). Cart customisation (which affects the way cart behaves) + 16 different characters (17 when you add Mii) allow you to add personal touch to your racing. Overall it's a very solid game that makes for a perfect introduction to a great system that is 3DS.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Brandonk917,24-03-2012,"The newest entry of Mario Kart is definitely fun with some glaring faults. There is no mission mode this time around which is a real shame. Single player consists of grand prix, time trial, and battle. Grand prix has eight cups with four having new courses and the rest with old tracks. Time trial has yourself trying to beat your own times with an option to race ghosts. Battle mode is a disappointment. There are only six tracks with coin battle being broken since once you have ten coins, you can't grab any more. This makes you just run away for the rest of the race. The main reason you would want this game is for the multiplayer. The online is flawless with a constant sixty frames per second. There is also no snaking anymore which is a huge plus.

VeryCrispy,09-06-2012,"A very solid version of Mario Kart and currently one of my favorite 3DS games. I really enjoy the variety of characters and kart components. I also really like the online play. It is very easy to get into some good matches with some random people. The community mode is interesting but I haven't had much success with it. I can't really fault Mario Kart for that but more that 3DS players aren't as abundant as Nintendo probably would have hoped. With Mario Kart and the other new releases like Heroes of Ruin and Kid Icarus hopefully it will become more popular and make the community mode more relevant.

Single player mode is great though and excellent for casual gaming. I strongly recommend picking up this game and it definitely makes having a 3DS worthwhile.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
nbajunior,04-07-2012,Mario Kart 7 is a very good 3ds game with a lot of content. It is an absolout must have! The small character roster and same extra game modes(balloon battle & coin runners) keep this from being a 10.

Piplup1144,25-11-2012,"This game is like a advanced version of Mario Kart since it had to do with Streetpass, Spotpass, online 8 players, underwater race, air race, and more! There are so many new features in this game. This game may get boring, but it's one fun game to play. Players who played the older Mario Kart game might enjoy this game and also who is new to Mario Kart. Instead of choosing a selected car, you can customize your own car in 3 different parts. These 3 parts are: Body(This is where you sit), and Wheels(This is needed for driving), and Wings(You don't want to fall 100 feet!).

StrangerMonco,07-12-2012,"I love mariokart 7. i think its the best or at least joint best with with DoubleDash. It handles great and looks great. the lack of characters is a dissapointment though. and the new tracks are good, but the choice of classic tracks are a massive let downs. i expected to see more super mario kart/mariokart 64/mariokart super circuit/doubledash tracks, but we get a mixture of those with WII and DS tracks. WTF. they arent classics, they are recent. dont include them in. we want nostalgia. Mariokart WII is the WORST mariokart yet. and im soo glad nintendo redeemed themselves with 7. they also didnt even pick the best tracks from the DS and WII version. i think what could have been improved also is the lack of characters and lack of customisations. you should have a lot of customisations to begin with, and be able to unlock more and more more frequently. not do 8 races to unlock 1 set of tires youre not going to use. ive always been an acceleration man myself but when it comes to customisation im presented the same problem i had with mass effect 1. with mass effect 1 you would get some amazing armour, with the best stats, but it was green and pink and looked like turd; then you get some amazing, bolt metal, heavy machine armour, but its stats are awful. With mariokart 7, my best combination is to have a bumblebee car, small puny tires and a parachute. the car looks awful, but has the best stats for me. id prefer it if you picked the stats you want, and had the customisations you want. i know this kinda defeats the point of customisation. but do we really need it? its fun and good....if its done properly but i suppose for the first to include customisations, its done a pretty good job. i would recommend mk7 to anyone, and it will take many many hours of your time. oh and 1 more thing i dont like...they took out that options mode where you could create a little vinyl to have on the front of your car. that would have been perfect for street pass, so i dont know why theyve taken it out :/",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Victory,11-12-2012,"I'd say this is one of the better Mario Kart games out there. I enjoyed it more than the Wii version and the old DS version. I'd recommend this over the others due to the greater variety of sections, where you can drive under water for a little bit or use a glider. This breaks up the action nicely so it is not as monotonous as previous games. One thing I will say on the negative side is the amount of levels is the same as always, 4 new cups and 4 revamped old school cups from previous game making up 16 tracks in total. If you have played all the Mario IKarts to death like me then the old cups are slightly.. well.. been there done that.. While not a bad number it's just a big boring sometimes to see the same set up with every release.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
FaloRoy,14-12-2012,"This game is definitely one of the better Mario Kart games made so far, in spite of the feeling that it is somewhat rushed. Game play has gotten the addition of gliders and underwater driving, both of which do feel like a nice change from the usual driving experience in previous games. Both allowed me to find alternate routes and even some shortcuts, so they really do work. The kart handling in these areas do vary with different combinations, some will work better than others, but the experience is satisfying. My only problem with these two features is that on a few of the tracks they do feel pretty useless, like the underwater driving on N64 Koopa Beach. Otherwise, they are cool new additions that don't screw up the game play. The single player offering is solid with the usual circuit racing, battle mode, and time trials. The new tracks are colorful and creative, and do offer their own sort of challenge to the game, like Music Park and the new Rainbow Road. Retro tracks are also nice and utilize the new track add-ons effectively, for the most part. Battle mode is decent, but I wished the new courses actually had some gliding and underwater driving. In spite of that all the tracks are pretty cool, too. Plus, collecting data via Streetpass can get you another person's ghosts and their own created Grand Prix, which is an interesting versus mode-like way to play. While it doesn't have the options of Vs. mode, if you like the tracks in this game, then the custom Grand Prix will be an enjoyable experience. Multiplayer mode is amazing, especially the online, which is really the best so far. The ability to play in communities with set rules is a nice change from just entering random matches. You can also play against registered friends, past opponents, and people you've met by way of Streetpass as another way to join a game. I was even able to see my record against them and even what mode they where playing in (Battle or Race). That, along with very little lag, no hackers, and the patch to fix glitch abuse on some of the tracks makes this a big improvement in the online department. As for the local multiplayer it is just as good as what the DS version offered, and I found no problems with that either. The items have been toned down, and some were taken out (like the POW block) to scale back the luck element, and take my word for it: it's for the best. The new items also don't feel too over-powered. The Lucky 7 is very useful and not frequent, the Fire Flower can be annoying at times, but is a great projectile weapon, and the Tanooki Tail is good for close-combat and defense as long as you're patient with it. I was only annoyed by the Blue Shell's ability to roll me to a side, although it rarely threw me off the track and I do feel like that complaint is being over-blown by some people. The game itself does lean towards pure racing rather than luck so that better drivers will finish higher most of the time, which is great for the serious gamers. The sound is superb, with many catchy tunes for each course, and the character voices didn't annoy me a lot either. Graphics are great for the platform and the 3D effect is nice to look at as well. Section tracks were a cool new feature, kart customization is simple, but not too streamlined, and the first-person view with gyro controls works surprisingly well. The only problem with gyro controls is that you are using them on a handheld, so it will feel awkward at first. The character list is pretty good, even though they did take out some popular ones from past games, and the character list size of 17 is actually not that bad for a 3DS game. Sense of speed in this game is pretty nice for a Mario Kart game, and not too boring. They did bring back coins to increase speed and unlock new kart parts, which is also nice to aim for in a race. The tweaks to the game may be conservative, but Mario Kart is at the point where the core elements have been so tampered with, that they have found the right spot in this game.
All-in-all, this game is excellent. I do wish the single-player offering was a little deeper, the characters choices a little better, and the new battle tracks a bit more inspired, but those are really just minor problems. Multiplayer is better than ever, tracks are great, game play is well-done, and the game is fun all-around. Must-own if you have a 3DS or are a fan of Mario Kart.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
jimmer_winner,21-02-2013,"This Mario Kart may not have had as big of an impact on its system as Mario Kart DS did, but it is unquestionably the best Mario Kart yet. The controls are very smooth and precise, and I have my own customized kart that I can maneuver almost perfectly. I was disappointed that there was no traditional versus mode with just one player and computers, but maybe that was something only I enjoyed. The lack of missions didn't bother me. The graphics for the most part were amazing, the best yet, although some character models like Bowser still seemed kind of clunky. The tracks weren't as memorable as past ones felt, but after going back to play Mario Kart DS, Mario Kart 7's tracks seemed a lot more complete and satisfying in comparison. The re-addition of coins is great as well. Mii characters are forgettable.

Matt1251,28-03-2013,"Wow. Just wow. Between this and all the other Mario Kart games, this franchise is, hands down, my favorite VG franchise ever. Firstly, the courses. The courses have a great deal of diversity to them. From the simplicity of Toad Circuit and Luigi Raceway to the epicness of Rainbow Road, all of the courses were very fun to play. Second, the karts. Where do I begin? Really, everywhere! The kart customization, never before seen in a Mario game, shines. My personal favorite is the Soda Jet with mushroom wheels and the paraglider. I'm telling you, the possibilities are endless. Finally, the online play. Let me just say this: About 90% of my time playing this game is for the online. The new addition of communities is nice. It's also very challenging in some of them to get to the top of the leaderboard. You start with 1000 VR, or BR if you like battles instead of racing. From my knowledge, the limit is 99,999 VR(BR). My goal is to get to 10,000 sometime. About 5,800 to go! Overall, this game is quite possibly the best Mario Kart game yet, and I look for more in the future!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Beastprogamer,26-02-2015,"Second best Mario Kart game with first being Mario Kart Wii. The characters are okay,the graphics are stunning,the stages and courses are the best. Maka Wuhu is my favourite stage and my time trial best is approximately 1 min. and 10sec. Online is decent. I like how the Mario Kart Channel came back and the please wait a moment sound effect was also reused from Mario Kart Wii. One of the best handheld game of ALL-TIME and you should definitely go pick it up.

With some beautiful graphics, great controls, and some very nice additions from the last game in the series, I feeled like I was actually riding in a go-kart through this entire game. The 3D in this game actually helps , and makes it feel much more crisp than previous installments. I think that this might be the best Mario Kart game.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It has well-designed tracks as well as the usual 16 retro tracks, customizable karts, a large lineup of characters, and great graphics for a 3DS game. You unlock karts, characters, and parts through Grand Prix races. The online mode works really well with constant full lobbies and virtually no lag. Local multiplayer is great as well.

GamecubeLover,01-08-2016,Mario Kart 7 is good but probably the worse in the series. I think the game has a BAD selection of characters and the courses are similar to other mario kart courses. This game is also another way to use Miis but the concept is overused.,7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

TheOkCringe,26-04-2020,"This game is all right, but certainly not a perfect title. The game definitely offers some innovative mechanics, and some pretty memorable courses, but the overall feel of this game if kind of awkward. The battle feels lackluster, especially with the 10 coin limit in Coin Runners, which makes no sense. Nothing totally wrong with the title, but it only got a 6.83 out of 10 from me, making it my 6th favorite title.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
modeVII,04-12-2011,"After playing all the cups at least one, and some of the early ones a few more times with out kart configurations, quick synopsis of this latest Mario Kart is that it is tentatively brilliant.

The first obvious change when start racing is the feel. It's closer to the Wii version with the sliding. There's no left-right wiggle as with the DS version; you hold the slide as long as possible to build the boost. Most obvious is that it feels so sluggish to the DS. There you can flick the kart all over the place. Also, driving on dirt kills you! It slows you down so much and can barely steer. This is where the ""monster"" tyres come in, if you choose to select. Obviously you lose general handling and acceleration.

Equally with the Wii, tracks are quite elaborate, and seem generally brilliant. Need more time to decide - to see how they cope in full race mode once familiarity sets, push karts and tracks to their limits. Already it seems they have a good learning curve to really excel, especially with the karts with lesser handling and acceleration.

Also new is when you hop at the crest of a jump, you get a small boost on landing. I believe something similar in Wii where you'd waggle for a trick. Works really well in 3DS.

The glider addition works well. By hopping off jumps and angling the glide, allows some strategy in gliding, whether diving for coins, or creating lift to clear sections of track.

The 3D is good. I use it all the time. Of course, it's not necessary to enjoy the game.

Difficulty is much the same as other MKs - ie: easy! In my first go (150cc), I played all new cups for a 1st (two attempts), 1st, 3rd & 4th. On retro cups, did first two for 1st & 1st. A friend defeated both final cups on first attempt, the retro one winning all races. He owned Wii MK so was able to adapt easily to the handling. He raced with high acceleration and handling configuration. The big advice with the difficulty is to use heavier karts and fatter tyres - ie: reduce acceleration and handling. That, along with using a fatter character, will substantially increase the challenge. I've made this my personal challenge to defeat the game on standard kart and wheels. So far, in about 7 attempts, racing on the first 3 new cups, not even close to winning any.

Best of all with MK7, standard MK cheapness is there. Meaning that while often it seems unfair, it never is. Racing to hold of the hoard and even winning against the odds, it's still so satisfying. Remember also that tables will turn. One race I was leading for most of the last lap, then got hammered with blue shell and fireballs, dropping to 7th. I was furious. Then picked up a lightning and glided over in first. If there's some criticisms, it's is that the fake item is no longer part of your arsenal. While 16 new and 16 old tracks sounds nice, why not 20 new and 60 old? Even easier, why not tracks to be raced in reverse (not mirror). Sure some will need jumps or zippers to make them work. So! Add it. That immediately doubles the tracks available. Also, how about a track creator like Mod Nations Racer? My only hope is that Nintendo will add this in time. At least DLC for new tracks. This fascist way that Nintendo works has bothered me for years. As the review says here, custom options should be any combination of items, not just a single item. I'd love to set triple-reds and tails in a custom race. Why can't I?

Other changes are all positive. Gone is the horrible POW weapon introduced for Wii that knocked out everyone ahead of you. Add to the fact the grid is back to 8 racers from 12, it means for a far more fluid race. New weapons include the Tanooki Tail to whip nearby karts and block weapons, and a Fire Flower that allows shooting fireballs forwards or backwards. Both are great. The Lucky 7 (7 items all out your disposal) surprisingly doesn't over-power the game. In fact, often they are not all used for you lose them from someone else's attack.

The next test is the online and just see how the game really excels and its overall balance - because the multi-player is the true measure of the game. While I rate MK DS as easily the best of the series, it was plagued with the ""snakers"" that could turbo-wiggle the entire course. The revised sliding method on MK7 means that MK7 has potential to be at least a close second if the balance no adverse exploitation is there. Right now, two friends that swore off buying a 3DS and MK7 already see the potential. One has bought the game and a 3DS with the other very much considering it.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Phalanx2006,04-12-2011,"I have played every Mario Kart title to date and this one has the best online multiplayer yet. In fact it has the best multiplayer of any Nintendo published title to date, in my opinion. The communities feature is a really nice touch. I would have given it a 10/10 if not for the requirement of friend codes. The tracks are a great mix of old and new and the ghost data obtained through StreetPass is a great use of the feature. Now if only they did something about those friend codes....",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Ironmonger,17-12-2011,"The game was good, but not great. The glider and under water capabilities do add new dimensions, but they aren't in the races enough. The glider is only used is a little over half the races. Even when it is used, the average glide lasts no more than 6 sec. Being under water is cool, but the only difference between water and land is a slower discent and wider drifting. My three main NOs were: 1.) Only half the courses were new. Yes, it is cool to relive old courses, and I didn't see every game, so some were new. However, the Mario Kart DS (first for DS) game had every course new, which was awsome! 2.) The battle courses are kind of boring. Mario kart DS had battle courses with levels the fight above and below others. 3.) the biggest one, THEY REMOVED THE CHALLENGE MODE!!! Mario kart DS had a mode where you could do unusual talks in a kart leading up to mario kart boss battles. That part of the game was my favorite!!! *P.S. To Nintendo: would a storyline in the game hurt at all?",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
realgamefan,21-12-2011,"Mario Kart is back and better than ever. Beautiful graphics, fantastic courses, and awesome online. The online is the best Nintendo ever produced. Mario Kart 7 gets my highest recommendation to 3DS owners and newcomers to the system. Fun, Fun, fun!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Luigibarqs,10-12-2011,"Mario Kart 7 is the third Mario Kart game for portable Nintendo consoles and the seventh Mario Kart game overall (excluding the spinoffs Mario Kart GP 1 & 2 for arcades which featured a crossover between the Super Mario series and the Pac-Man series). The game consists of 13 characters with 5 of which being unlockable. The starting line up of 8 characters you get when you first start the game consists of Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Princess Peach Toadstool, Kinopio Toad, Koopa Troopa, Donkey Kong (previously known as Donkey Kong Jr. in the SNES title, his father being Donkey Kong Sr./Cranky Kong from the Donkey Kong arcade game) and King Bowser Koopa which is the exact same cast as Super Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Super Famicom. The main gameplay gimmicks consist of performing tricks off of ramps with the R button to gain speed boosts, gathering coins to gain small boosts and slightly increase top speed and acceleration but the benefit maxes out at 10 coins, utilizing a glider and propeller to guild yourself around both in the air and in the water respectively, using drift boosts to speed up, and finally for the first time ever in a Mario Kart game, the ability to switch between First Person and Third Person driving views. For the first time in the Mario Kart Series since Mario Kart 3: Super Circuit for Gameboy Advanced there is two Rainbow Road tracks available for selection. Two mechanics, Drafting which has been significantly empowered and Drift Boost which have been significantly nerfed return however the Snaking concept which was a popular use of the drift boost mechanic in Mario Kart 5: DS for significantly increasing speed seems to be next to impossible to pull off thanks to the new game mechanics. The Single Player offline experience has been significantly minimized since Mario Kart DS mostly due to the Mission Mode and VS Mode being dropped leaving only Gran Prix Mode, Time Trials Mode, Balloon Battle Mode and Coin Runners Mode as the only single player modes. On the other hand, the Multiplayer modes have had a major content upgrade, Wireless play and Download play give you access to all tracks and far more content than in its DS prequel. Wifi modes consists of 2-8 player racing and battling, you can also create personalized community server groups with your own personal rules and game modes that can be accessed by a password code and later saved to a favourites list for later easy access. Once a day get a download of various content to your Mario Kart 7 channel (if connected to Wifi) such as ghost data to race against in single player and various other challenges and activities leaving you with some replay value for offline single player play. In online you now have a Virtual Ranking score (VR) as well as a win and loss list.
Your VR increases if you place in the higher ranks, it decreases if you disconnect during a race and it stays the same if you place low. People that you meet in wifi races will be recorded so you can track them if you want a rematch and their information also added to Mii Plaza and games with similar features like Super Mario Land 3D. If you are expecting an in depth multiplayer and online experience, you should probably get this game, if you want an in depth single player or offline experience, you should probably look elsewhere.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Wormoid,05-12-2011,"It's not a joke, this is Mario Kart at it's best yet! Mario Kart 3DS is the 7th entry in the long running Mario Kart series, and it has made the biggest leap in the Mario Kart series to date. The courses themselves are obviously created by some of Nintendo's greatest minds, and unlike Mario Kart Wii, the courses are tight, well made, and allow for expert play. 16 characters and not far from hundreds of Kart combinations, the seasoned player can easily get a combination that suits them well. Time trialing has received extra emphasis, and the effort is clear to see in it's entirety. Daily entries from Nintendo and Retro Studios make you come back for more each day. Furthermore, Online is much improved, it follows Marion Kart Wii's set up but drops the previous lag which allows for racing online at a smooth 60 Frames Per Second, even in 3D. Communities allow groups of people to get together and play each other, and even have leaderboards to keep you coming back to try and get to the top. However, it's not without it's faults. The lack of Event mode and minor item inbalance (Although well improved from MK Wii) hinders 7 from achieving a perfect score, but it's the best Mario Kart yet. And quite possibly one of the best racers ever.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

I enjoyed being able to customize my Kart and the fact that a glider will pop out when you are airborne was a fun addition. The online is very well done and lots of fun. It is a game a hardcore gamer can enjoy or you can toss it to a first timer and they will get the hang of it very quickly.

The only things that bothered me were small things like the lack of characters from previous games. The character roster being rather small compared to what I thought it would be. Waluigi, Dry Bones, Dry Bowser, Birdo, Funky Kong, as well as a few others, have been ignored in favor of some less important characters (IMO) such as Lakitu, Metal Mario, Wiggler, and the Queen Bee from the Mario Galaxy series. I mean c'mon why would you take Waluigi from us? The 10 coin limit is also rather annoying when you are trying to unlock different car parts. All in all, its worthy to pick up, but it could have had a lot more unlockables, maybe a few new modes to shake up the mix, and easier online capabilities.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The only thing that subtracts points is the addition of only 16 new tracks and limited options for the rest of the game (battle mode and coin runs).

It somehow managed to take the graphical level of the Wii version, improve on it, and put it in a handheld console. The drifting mechanic has been changed to mimic the Wii's, requiring you to hold left/right continuously rather than wiggle the d-pad left and right. The gliding mechanic works quite well, and is quite fun to play around with. The kart customization is fun to change around and mess with to find your dream kart. The Wi-Fi multiplayer is excellent, and is where I spend most of my time. Even if you don't have an Internet connection, the challenge of obtaining 3 stars on every cup is always there.

Mario Kart 7 has good game-play, and customization is fine, its that the character roster is very small, only compromises of 12 characters. Online mode is hacked at times, leaving a player vulnerable to being hacked, or meeting hacker on a race, and leaving servers down for maintenance

Speaking of ""leaving"", Nintendo left some things out. What happened to quick race?! Or what about the beloved missions from Mario Kart DS?!? They decided not to add those.

That isn't all, the whole game is one big glitch. Maka Wuhu has a glitch that can skip three quarters of the whole track. What promises to be a revolutionary game would've been one if they fixed everything and added what the players wanted.

Lustikurre,13-05-2014,"+ New amazing tracks (including 1-way tracks).
+ Aquatic racing and gliding.

- A.I cheating,
- Powerslide babyfied,
- Skill = luck
- Removed game modes (Single race and Mission mode)

If you ever played the DS version of mario kart you know what a mario kart game should play like. Nintendo has removed all skill in this game as the powerslide is now automatic so you cannot catch up if you're behind or broaden your lead with pure powerslide skills.

The whole game is mostly based upon luck now. Will you get bombarded with blue shells? The answer is moslty ""Yes"", especially when you're in the lead at the final lap. You cannot do ANYTHING to avoid them either. On the 1-way tracks the A.I is always faster than you for some odd reason, making it even harder to finish in first place.

Another let down is the removal of the single race and the mission modes from the DS version.
I loved being able to play race after race with the cource chosen at random for me, or playing the cool missions once in a while, but Nintendo oddly chose to remove features instead of adding new ones.

All in all this is a stripped down version of the DS version and my conclusion would be that if you don't own the DS version I'd say give that version a go before this one. Trust me, the gliding and the aquatic racing isn't better than skillful powersliding and more game mode options.",3,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Brc123,15-11-2014,"I think people are giving this game leverage just because it's ""Mario Kart"". Don't get me wrong, I love Mario Kart, but I could have done fine with not buying this game.

I will start with the positives: The tracks are very good. The game looks fantastic for a Nintendo Handheld. And the underwater and hang gliding actually feels like a much-needed feature. The soundtrack is pleasant, the controls feel smooth and accurate. The new items are fun. And the kart customization is pretty cool. And that's about it.

Now for the negatives: I have no idea why Nintendo brought back coins, it only adds to the luck factor when you're hit 5 times in a row by shells, bullet bills, stars, and your loss of coins causes your maximum speed to go down. The roster is beyond pathetic. Taking out classics such as Waluigi, Toadette, Birdo, Diddy Kong, etc, for characters like Lakitu, Metal Mario, HONEY QUEEN? Really? Probably Mario Kart 7's most unforgivable mistake was the absence of a VS mode. If you don't have Wifi or a friend with the game, you can play Grand Prix (Gets old really fast and can't choose specific maps), Time Trial (Boring...), and the terrible Battle mode. The elimination for balloon battle, shine runners, etc, was the best part of battle mode, but with coins it is pretty much impossible to lose and extremely boring.

All in all, the game feels lazy, and was probably just rushed out to help out with the 3ds's abysmal launch sales. I may have ranted a lot about the cons of this game, but the things Nintendo did do well in this game, were fantastic. I will continue to have mixed feels about this game but for now",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

funkydoodycool,28-05-2015,"An almost perfect Mario Kart game. I've long preferred the handheld offerings, at least for single player fun, and this entry has not let the series down. The tracks are all exciting and fun, the graphics are beautiful and the music enjoyable on every track. The game seems to have been balanced better than others, with the CPU players not seeming to ""cheat"" as often - on MKDS I would often be close to winning a race when a few million red and blue shells would come at me and make me end 5th. Well, it seemed that way sometimes.

Of course the game includes a Retro cup, with levels from earlier entries remade in the 3DS engine. These are fun and almost entirely great choices. One strange choice though was to include levels from the DS game, which you can play on your 3DS console anyway, but I guess not EVERYONE has it. It IS nice to see them in the upgraded game engine though!

Gameplay remains largely the same as you will know from the series, with additions from the Wii title including a speed boost if you hit the hop button as you leave a ramp. To me this adds little to the racing - if anything it makes it even easier to get to the front of the pack. This is already a little easier than the others, probably due to the previously mentioned lack of ""cheating"" CPU. This game also includes short flying sections (sometimes shoehorned into the retro tracks) where you leave certain ramps and a hang glider pops out of your car. This is fun, but again adds little to the racing. I would have preferred to see a Diddy Kong Racing styled choice between flying or driving on selected tracks.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Even online you still feel like you are on your own as it's become more about holding a racing line than actually competing with your opponents via power-ups and launching things at them.

Lots of people love this game but I have no idea why. It's too simple to be a simulation and its too boring to be an arcade racer.

My only gripe with MK7 is the fact that it is on a handheld. I love the Mario Kart series, but that is due to its local multi-player. Because it isn't easy to gather a group of friends who all own a 3ds and MK7 and are all available to play, my favorite aspect of MK is removed.

GoombaJMR,12-01-2014,"This is a wonderful and probably the best racing game on the 3DS out here right now, and the quality of multiplayer greatly increases the amount of play value in this game, but it lacks two things that can make this game a wonderful one to play on-the-go. The first thing is that there is no VS mode (aka single player, choose your own options tracks). This is a huge problem with the game, as there is probably no wifi therefore no online play for you to play when you are away. The second thing is that battles have time limits, which isn't much of a downside, but if you remember MKDS, There was never a limit. You could play and have fun while screwing with the AI as much as you want. The roster is also quite small, but that could be changed with a dlc or update.

gorelequint,19-04-2013,"Everything about this is an improvement over the Wii version slightly better handling, replacing the tricks with surprisingly good hang-glider and underwater sections, great course designs, slightly less chaotic, meaning a skillful player stands a higher chance of winning (as opposed to the Wii, which made it very hard for the most skillful player to consistenly win, with it's over the top blue shells etc.)

The graphics are a big step up from the DS version.

The reason I'm marking it with only 3 stars, is for 2 of the most willfully stupid design decisions I've ever seen in a modern video game.

Firstly they've removed single races so if you want to have a quick race on your favourite track? Tough, you can't. You have to do a 4-race Grand Prix in sequence you can't just have a single race. So if the track you fancy playing happens to be the excellent new Rainbow Road track, you have to finish 3 other races before you're allowed to play it (unless you choose to do a solo time trial). While it's not game breaking, it is an idiotically stupid decision. It's really page one of Video Game Design 101 in a racing game you let players pick a course and race on it... has there been any other racing game in modern gaming history where that feature was removed?

And secondly there are 2 camera views normal and the view surprisingly works really well, gives a great impression of speed, lets you have a close-up view of the other racers. It should be a lovely optional extra feature for players who prefer it... except... when you select view, tilt controls are enabled whether you want them or not.

Other companies allow the player to choose which control method they prefer, and which camera they prefer... but apparently not Nintendo.
If you like the view, you have to suffer tilt controls whether you want them or not... and if you prefer the conventional view, you're not allowed to use the tilt controls even if you wanted to.
Tilt controls are ok, but tilting messes up the 3D so you you like the 3D effect, and like the view, you have to painstakinginly keep the 3DS dead level as you steer with the circle pad (cirle pad still works in view), anytime you accidently tilt the console, you veer off to the side.

Another annoyance is the 3D the depth of 3D is really toned down here, compared to something like Starfox. Again, other companies might let the player choose how much 3D the player wanted (after all, that's the whole purpose of the 3D slider) but no, Nintendo have decided that the players only have the option of a very gentle 3D effect here if you wanted deeper 3D like other games? Tough, Nintendo have decided you can't have it.

There's no denying, it's great to look at, fun to play but when Nintendo start turning into Apple, with their philosphy of telling customers what they want, instead of allowing them to choose, and it starts to impact on how much fun a game is to play, they deserve criticism.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

There was a time, back when Mario Kart Double Dash was the major MK at the time, even though there was no Story Mode, as is typical with Mario Kart, Double Dash had a decent amount more replay value than Mario Kart Wii and 7.

knifeandfork,17-07-2013,"This game is amazing. The track designs are perfect, allowing secret shortcuts, including great obstacles, and generally excelling, and the 3D effect couldn't be better. Those who've played mario kart before know to expect by now. Mario Kart 7 adds some new items- the fire flower, which does exactly what you would expect, and the tanooki suit, which allows you to flick nearby karts with your tail. The problem is it's nigh-on impossible to get close enough to a kart to do that. The last new item isn't really new- the lucky seven gives you seven items to use, but one of those a bob-omb, and if a kart touches it you both blow up. Another is a star, but another kart could easily collect it. So the new items are disappointing, but at least not crazily out of control like in Mario Kart Wii. There's a new feature though- kart customisation. Using this, you can piece together a kart using wheels, the kart itself, and the glider to go with it. It's so much better than ever before, allowing you more freedom with karts than ever. There aren't many characters to choose from, but you can play as the 3DS's mii. Just not as anyone else's mii. The character options aren't bad, but there could be more of them. Another addition is the glider. Off certain ramps, you can soar through the air. It's faster than driving, so you should stay in the air as long as possible. There is a time trials mode as well, which is made better by streetpass and via the online mario kart channel. Which brings me onto another thing: the online. This is brilliant, as you can not only search for random players, but play with friends, and create your own custom communities with set rules for what items appear. And there's also local multiplayer as usual. This is an excellent Mario Kart game, second only to Mario Kart DS.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Klobb,20-07-2013,"This is a great game, but it's not the best Mario Kart game.
First, the good: This has the best tracks in the series. Every new track has been made with care and precision, and every retro track has been remade perfectly (except Koopa Troopa Beach- they butchered that imo). Online is also amazing, and you'll find yourself spending hours racing against strangers of varied skill. This game also has the best controls of every Mario Kart (turning doesn't suck, and there's no snaking), and single card multiplayer allows all tracks to be played (unlike Mario Kart DS only allowing 8). Now, the bad. Firstly, the characters suck. Instead of Waluigi and Funky Kong we get a fat bee and the jerk that throws spinies at you. Sorry to be negative, but characters could have been so much better. Metal Mario is cool, though. Then there's the absence of single player VS. I spend hours upon hours on that mode in MKDS and MKWII, so Nintendo removing it is a step backwards for me. Battle Mode sucks, too. It beats the Wii's abysmal battle mode, but points are not as fun as lives. Lastly, the game came with a few glitches- they aren't a big deal, but they shouldn't be there. Still, an excellent game and I recommend it to any 3DS owner. It plays the best, but lacks features. 9/10",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
AtomicLugia,29-08-2013,"Aww, another multiplayer-only game. Yes, it contains a single player mode but it's so pathetic. They made the V.S. mode only for the stupid multiplayer.

Good things about the game is Rosalina, who's getting another chance to be playable. And the multiplayer is good, because this game is ONLY for multiplayer.

kerglis711,03-08-2013,"Game play-9: This game is the best of the mario kart series, and it makes me never want to return to wii again. The controls are amazing, and the secrets are very nice. However, in wifi matches, the items are highly overpowered and often leave me in poor places just because of luck when I should be in second or third. In other words I had to dock a point because the items are very unbalanced. However, this is one of the smoothest racing games available and you cant hate that, and the gliding and kart building feature are as good as Nintendo's ads would make you think.
Length-7: Sure it has 4 difficulties, but it's just the same experience harder. There is a nice variety with 32 tracks, but grand prix mode blows by in an instant, a problem with all mk games. Although however, you can still shoot for VR and records, and the difficulties is at least somewhat padding so I'll let it through with a 7, although i was considering a 5 or 6.
Sound-9: I love the crisp and great sounding music, and the retro tracks revamps sound especially well, I found a few tracks that didn't sound good though so i can't give it a perfect 10.
Graphics-9: The backgrounds and everything are amazing, however i found a few things a bit underdone, but all in all it gets a 9.
Fun-10: The fast paced fun it gives can't compare to most other games, unless your tired of it, it may be one of the first games to come to mind when you want to have fun with friends. This masterpeice is the pinnacle of not just the mario kart series, but the entire racing series itself!

MIDP,04-08-2013,"Just like every other Mario Kart, this is a great multiplayer experience. However, what hinders this game from getting a perfect 10 and me, still preferring to play the old ""Mario Kart DS"" instead, is the simple lack of the ""Settings"" option that exists both on the Wii and DS version.

What exactly am I talking about?
Well, first off, let me have you know that,
Graphics in this game are amazing, top notch.
Online is the best in the series so far.
Levels are maybe not THE best in the series, some of the new ones are fun, but I definitely miss some old ones, but that wouldnt keep them away from a perfect score in my opinion.

So, to answer what I mean with this ""Setting"" stuff.
In Mario Kart Wii as well as DS you can play multiplayer. When you do so, you can then choose the rules of how you play which are two simple choices ""Wins"" or ""Races"".
This means if I play multiplayer with 5 friends, we can play a tournament, with the computer over 30 races if we wish. Or 2, or 8,15, you get it, whatever we want.
Now however, some genius at Nintendo decided to remove this option, limiting us to 4 race tournaments.
There is nothing wrong with a classic 4 race tournament of Mario Kart. But the question is, why remove the option?

I who personally love to play a cup of 8 races with my brothers and friends can now not do that. And another thing is when playing the ""Communites"" online, I can there also, only play 4 races, but now without any computers, which mean I cant play an online tournament with one friend...unless its one on one races of course.

Thats really not what Mario Kart is all about.
Of course I can go and play against other humans with my brother, and keep track of where we are placed. But video games are a lot about immersion, and that kind of ruins it.
This is why I now have gone back to Mario Kart DS when racing on my handheld with friends.

Great game, but a simple setting is what has taken away the lasting appeal along with the perfect 10 to a 7 out of 10 with this rating system.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

NathanJones,12-09-2013,"Alright before I begin, let me get this out of the way first. Out of all the Mario Kart games, Mario Kart Super Circuit still remains one of my favorites. Mario Kart 7 was the first 3DS game I ever had. The 3D is great, the gameplay is fun, and the multiplayer is fun. It's cool that you can race everyone from around the world online, but when you use the items they don't even WORK at times! It takes over probably 2 seconds to hit the opponent right in front of you!

But even so, Mario Kart 7 rocks. Score: 9/10.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
User12345,22-09-2013,"Mario kart 7 is a decent game. But has lots of problems. First of a all this game was rushed for Christmas which is why retro studios had to come and help. But that is why there are not a lot of characters in this one. Also no vs mode offline is really annoying to those that would like to race by them selves on there own decided courses. Time trails is not that good because you can't save a replay and the ranking is not like Mario kart wii how it had a better ranking system. Now for the good. First online is here with 8 player battle and vs which is really fun. Your ranking goes by VR in this one just like Mario kart wii. But you gain VR slowly and I barely get matched up with people around my skill level, I've been paired up with someone that had 33,000 VR meanwhile I only had 1,137 VR. That is a problem which every nintendo game online suffers with. I can describe online in one word lag. No matter how good of an internet you have you will get lag which is frustrating I have been hit 3 times in less than 5 seconds with that stupid tanooki tail, star than red shells. From 2nd to last in less than five seconds. It's not fun when that happens because no matter what item you get it won't bring you back I guarantee. Now for communities, first thing I thought of when I heard about communities. ""Wow this actually seems cool"" but I was dead wrong. First of all your community is not private as people you've played with can join via the friendsopponents list. And it takes long to join one once I was waiting for 30 minutes to get in one and it had five of my friends and we all have good internet. The game had no skill involved all luck. Such a frustrating game. Wow so you don't get much in this game. This game could have been somewhat better if it was not rushed. But they knew people would still buy it which is stupid. I would rather wait and make the game better than making it rushed. Please nintendo don't this again it's embarrassing and just shows how much you care for the quality of the games, the fans and the reputation of your games.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Falcus,07-12-2013,"It's Mario Kart on the 3DS. Not much more to say.

The core game is great here--casual kart racing with insanely addictive multiplayer and smooth graphics. What's wrong with the game? Lots of things.

The multiplayer, while very fun, is extremely limited in terms of game modes. The two ""battle"" options are very simple offerings. The main mode is amazing, but major disconnection issues plague one's experience. It's rather annoying, especially when it takes a long time to load, connect, reload, and so on.

There are also very few characters to choose from, with just over 15 unless I'm mistaken. The new courses are pretty good, but none of them are anything spectacular. Also the kart customization is quite useless, as is the ""gliding"" mechanic and the underwater segments, as they last only for a minute or so.

The item imbalance will kill you--but that's what you've come to expect when you hear ""Mario Kart,"" right?

Other than those flaws, the game is great--addicting, fun, nice-looking. A good game for the 3DS, and for any fan of Mario Kart or kart racing in general.

Diego3005,28-12-2013,"This game is the best mario kart game ever, the tracks are really fun and there are many new and great characters. The only defect is that we can not play quick matches (vs.)",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GERCharon,02-02-2014,"Mario Kart 7 feels no different than its Wii predecessor. In singleplayer, you can choose out of 4 classes and out of 8 cups. Each cup consists of 4 Tracks. 4 cups consist of totally new tracks, the other 4 contain classic tracks. You can earn new kart parts by collecting coins, unlock some additional characters and get yourself some stars behind your nickname in multiplayer by completing every cup with a certain number of stars. Like in the Wii game, it is not exactly clear, what requirements have to be met to get the maximum of three stars.
There is also a Time Trial mode, where you can beat the records of people you met via StreetPass or SpotPass. (I actually never played it). You can also practice multiplayer games against the AI.
After I got the three Stars in every cup, the singleplayer offers no replay value for me, because I'm not interested in Time Trials.

As always, Mario Kart's strength is its multiplayer. You can play this game via download play, which I totally love. Players without a copy are forced to play as Shy Guy and cannot customize their karts, but who cares? You can race every single track, participate in cups, etc.
Internet play also works smoothly. Matchmaking doesn't take long and is mostly balanced. You get points for wins and loose points for losses. It is exactly the fun I expected. Sadly, you can only race single tracks against another. No cups are available in open matchmaking. Every player votes for a map and then one of them gets picked randomly. This sounds nice and fair but I found myself playing the same track a couple of times in a row.
Of course there is also the well known balloon battle mode and some other competitive minigames.

Mario Kart offers enough unlockables to make for a satisfying singleplayer. Its multiplayer works well and offers a lot of fun. You can also switch in to cockpit perspective and steer by using the gyrosensor. I would turn off the 3D effects for this one, though.

Still, it suffers the same problem of the Wii title: If you are a crappy driver it doesn't matter a bit, because the worst players get the best items, and the best player the worst items. You can race a perfect track and still get hit by a blue shell and then get placed last. You need no skill at all to hit with a red shell, and you normally can't evade them. I think that the game is just unfair, and that gameplay Is somehow broken because of this. Still, multiplayer offers lot of fun, especially when playing with friends. Drifting works like in the Wii, not the DS game.

Overall, graphics and sound are awesome. I like the new tracks and the selection of the old ones. I dislike gameplay balancing. Still it makes very much fun.

I do not understand that games like this, that are predestined for DLC doesn't get them, instead games like Super Mario Bros. gets some more levels...",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

I also love playing online on different communities and things. The Battle Mode is also much better than in MKW, because it makes it where teams is only an option where in MKW you had to be on teams which was something I HATED! The only gripe with this game is that it doesn't do anything too new to the series despite some new racing features like going underwater and gliding, but if you want a nice portable version of Mario Kart, then I would recommend Mario Kart 7. (One last thing, why is it called Mario Kart 7?

-beautiful designs
-first row 3ds tracks only bottom track previous games tracks
-new charcters
-A.I harder(not really)

pikodon,03-04-2014,"before the game came out there was a rumor about nintendo releasing DLC for games, and then I kept seeing mario kart 7, and I got really excited with the possibility of extra tracks other than the usual 16, and i was a little let down by the absence of that feature, especially with so many ""classic"" tracks that either came from mario kart wii, or from the classic track selection from mario kart wii, we expect to see new tracks everytime in 3D, thanks to moves like this, some people will never see their favorite tracks in 3D, because Coconut Mall is more important.
the random selecting track when playing online is a joke, there's a 90% chance you'll get tracks like coconut mall, daisy cruise, or 2 others ALL the time, sometimes is so frequent I wonder why didn't they call this coconut mall 7
also a cheap move was making you limited to getting 10 coins max whichever mode you're in, and don't give you coins you get in time trial or vs time trial, the lamest padding to make the game last longer considering you need them badly to unlock new kart parts.

but the gameplay is great, and the new gliding feature works really well and can give you a boost if get to use it well, really fun.

luisflopez,20-05-2018,"And here we are with another great installment in the Mario Kart series, one that I recently got to enjoy for the first time. MK7 a fun, quality game, but one that could have been better if it wasn’t for a series of dumb decisions made by Retro Studios and Nintendo.

The core gameplay is as fun as ever, so if you’re looking for the same good old Mario Kart gameplay, you’ll definitely find it here. The handling of the karts feels nice and responsive, althoguh I wish 150cc was a little bit faster. To me, it felt kind of slow compared to its direct predecessor, Mario Kart Wii.

MK7’s new tracks are remarkably good. And much of this is thanks to the game’s new racing gimmicks: underwater driving and paragliding through the air. Both of these are welcome additions that fit the Mario Kart formula perfectly, and lead to very creative course designs. Being able to race in first-person is a nice touch.

Another new feature in MK7 is the ability to customize your kart with different bodies, tires and paragliders. This is pretty cool idea, and it adds a good amount of variety to the game, but honestly, I still prefer the non-customizable, yet more iconic vehicles from Mario Kart Wii. Speaking of that game, bikes are gone, which is very disappointing.

MK7 also marks the return of coins, which are now used to unlock kart parts. On one hand, having something else to do apart from finishing first is a good idea that adds another layer of depth to races. But on the other hand, I think I didn’t really enjoy having kart parts locked behind coins. It takes away some of the excitement of unlocking things from beating cups and time trials. And also, the coin requirements for unlock new parts are way too high. They were obviously set with online play in mind, because for single players, unlocking everything is going to be a serious grind. It will take much longer than in any previous MK game.

Another aspect where MK7 disappointed me is the character roster, which is seriously bad. The Bee, Lakitu and Wiggler are all lame newcomers, and on top of that, they take Waluigi away for some inexplicable reason? Give me a break.

Another inexplicable absence is Versus Mode. Yep, the series staple Versus Mode is gone. This is a problem that also ties with the unlockables problem, negatively affecting single players. On top of having very high coin requirerments for unlocking new parts, the only way to earn those coins in single player is playing the Grand Prix cups again and again, because Versus mode is gone. Having a Versus mode where you play your own tournaments, with your own rules, tracks, teams and such, would make earning coins much more easy and fun. It would have also added a lot of replay value for single player.

For some reason, MK7’s battle mode is really boring. For the record, I spent a lot of time playing balloon battles in single player in Mario Kart DS, but in this game I get bored after the first round. The battles being no longer by elimination and rather by time, is one of the reasons to blame for this.

MK7 was my first experience playing Mario Kart online with other people. And boy is it addicting. I wish entering a race was a little quicker, but it is acceptable as it is.

So in all, Mario Kart 7 is a good installment for the franchise, one that will definitely have you covered if you’re looking for some simple, addicting hours of fun. Especially if you’re into playing online multiplayer. MK7 is a great game, and a very recommended purchase for any 3DS owner, but at the same time, it is an installment with weird flaws and shortcomings that could have been easily fixed.

JJTX,01-06-2019,"One of the best-looking games on the platform, and among the best in the long-running Mario Kart series. The only major drawback is the relatively small roster of racers.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Muffin_Reviews,07-06-2014,"This game is a grand new step into the racing genre and attempts to move away from generic racing to more varied and fun methods of getting round the extremely well crafted tracks with the use of a new glider power-up that lets you take to the skies and soar to victory or the underwater power up that allows for new and interesting sub-marine tracks that Nintendo are fantastic at making. Along with the 16 new courses there are also 16 re-mastered courses as always which have all the new features seamlessly added to them giving new ways to enjoy old courses.

However this is not the only thing that Nintendo has changed. New kart customisation has been added to the mix with some really creative ways to change up your kart with things such as wooden wheels and flower gliders each being given to you in a random order after getting a certain amount of coins. More characters have been added also with new racers such as Lakitu and Wiggler unlockable at the later 150 CC cups. Online also received a boost with it being easier and easier to race people around the world.

Despite all this this game isn't perfect. The kart parts you get after you get a certain number of coins is broken and whilst I did get parts I often got just wheels or chassis and didn't get a single glider until I had over 2,000 coins not an easy feat for someone less willing to grind for coins. This could be easily fixed with an in-game shop instead of the random parts system allowing players to choose what they unlock. This would increase the fun factor greatly as I would have the parts I wanted and not what the game decided it should give me.

Another thing to note is this game offers little challenge for the seasoned pro at Mario kart. The 150 CC mode can be challenging but was easy enough for me to beat in one or two tries on each cup. Overall there is little to no challenge in the single player as the AI just can't compete with players of a moderate skill level which was a shame as I was hoping for more of a challenge in this game. Lastly there is no real reason to keep playing after beating all the main courses. The battle mode is mediocre at best serving as a tacked on final thought to keep players for longer but isn't worth much.

Overall this game is fun, light hearted and a fun game despite it's minor flaws and gets a 8/10",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
dinosauryoshi,28-08-2014,"Yet another great Mario Kart.

I bought this when I was fed up of waiting for my Wii U MK8 bundle to arrive a few months ago and it proved a more than satisfying game to fill that gap and I still regularly turn to it for some on the move Mario Kart goodness.

Visually I like it a lot, things are bright and the 3D works well and adds a sense of speed, although I have to have it turned low otherwise I’m constantly moving out the sweet spot and things get blurry. Tracks are varied with a wide variety of themes keeping things interesting. The Kart customisations, although not as cool as the ones available in Mario Kart 8 still offer some nice variety, especially considering this is the game where this concept was first introduced.

The driving doesn’t feel as smooth as MK8 and it’s not as fun to drive. It is the most fun to drive of all the handheld iterations I’ve played so far however with drifting being a satisfying experience. Gliding and driving underwater (both of which were introduced in this version) also feel great. The Kart variations offer plenty of variety in terms of how you want your Kart to drive. There’s no bikes here however, not something that bothers me as I rarely use them anyway but some people will find this an issue I’m sure. The weapons are as good as ever with my only complaint on this front being the super leaf item which I’m glad they dropped for MK8. Although it’s satisfying to hit people with it it’s just not that useful unless people are right next to you. There’s the usual rubber-banding AI although it’s nowhere near as obvious as on the DS version and the AI proves to be fun competition most of the time. The online of this game is great too. Not far behind MK8 in terms of the interface although there are less available options. I’ve never experienced any disconnecting or lag issues either so it gets two thumbs up from me.

At this point it’s worth pointing out one area that MK7 thrashes MK8, and that’s the battle mode. 8 dedicated arenas and two fun modes make it very enjoyable to play, especially online. I do wish that you could have a life limit rather than a time limit on the balloon battle mode however (like the classic N64 version) and it’s a shame that all the arenas are played out on one level and not multiple levels like block fort and double deck (again from the N64 version). This would have made things a little more interesting.

Content wise there’s the now standard 16 new tracks and 16 retro tracks. Most of the new tracks are great (big fan of the Wuhu tracks in particular) although a few perhaps a little confusing (I’m looking at you Wario’s Galleon). The retro track choices are good too (especially the n64 ones but I’m biased on that front) but it would have been nice if they’d jazzed up some of the older tracks (from the SNES and GBA) a little like they did in MK8 as they look a bit plain and flat when compared to the others.

The character list is interesting to say the least with the rather questionable inclusion of Honey Queen and Wiggler and the exclusion of Diddy Kong. Other than those oddities though the roster is solid in my opinion and offers a good variety of racers from light to heavy.

Overall this game is a lot of fun, the new items, mechanics, and courses are all great and the online is well implemented. Its flaws are quite easily looked over due to just how enjoyable the game is in general and I see this as the best hand held Mario Kart yet.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
00-z3N,25-11-2017,"Review/Reseña (English/Español)

Score/Nota: 7.6/10

The first thing I played this great console was precisely this MK7 and there are many things, positive and negative, that can be said about this game. Starting from the most superficial, technically the game is beautiful, as usual in the MK, perfectly fluid and in terms of sound at the height of expectations. In the aspect of the difficulty is well covered as it offers enough without being impossible, speaking of the online functions, are very well implemented as well as the local cooperative function, which turns out to be the best that the game offers since the time of replay increases exponentially.

The tracks in general terms are fine, not as creative as in previous sagas, but decent, which is a bit disappointing since one of the main attractions of the game was ""land, air and sea"" and it feels like I'm lacking in terms of air and sea. As far as 3D is concerned, it is obviously uncomfortable for most, but it was an addition that was made very correctly, as well as the functions of the gyroscope. One of the things that most annoy most devotees of this saga was the roster of characters, and is that many charismatic characters were replaced by several that simply no one is interested, being a very strong mistake, because is evidently the core of the game are its characters.

Another point against we see when choosing the car and is that it is a step back in the saga the fact that they are personalized, instead of everyone having their own car. As a maximum point against and without being the total fault of the game as such, is the way to control it and is that due to the physical characteristics of the console, it results in a short time (1-2 hours) incredibly uncomfortable to play.

A very weak MK for what the franchise has accustomed us, and I only recommend it to the most diehard fans of it. 7.6/10

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Lo primero que jugué de esta genial consola fue precisamente este MK7 y son muchas las cosas, tanto positivas como negativas, que se pueden decir respecto a este juego. Partiendo de lo más superficial, técnicamente el juego es bellísimo, como de costumbre en los MK, perfectamente fluido y en términos sonoros a la altura de lo esperado. En el aspecto de la dificultad está bien cubierto ya que ofrece la suficiente sin ser imposible, a su vez las funciones online están muy bien implementadas, así como la función de cooperativo local, que resulta ser lo mejor que el juego ofrece ya que el tiempo de rejuego aumenta exponencialmente.

Las pistas en términos generales están bien, no tan creativas como en sagas anteriores, pero decentes, lo cual es un poco decepcionante ya que uno de los principales atractivos del juego era “tierra, aire y mar” y se siente como que falto en términos de aire y mar. En lo que al 3D se refiere, evidentemente resulta incómodo para la mayoría, pero como sea, fue un agregado que se hizo de manera muy correcta, así como las funciones del giroscopio. Una de las cosas que más molesto a la mayoría de devotos de esta saga fue el roster de personajes escogidos, y es que muchos personajes carismáticos fueron reemplazados por varios que simplemente a nadie le interesan, siendo un desacierto muy fuerte, ya que evidentemente el núcleo del juego son sus personajes.

Otro punto en contra lo vemos al momento de escoger el carro y es que es un paso hacia atrás en la saga el hecho de que sean armables, en lugar de que cada quien tenga su carro propio. Como punto máximo en contra y sin ser culpa total del juego como tal, es la manera de controlarlo y es que debido a las características físicas de la consola, resulta en poco tiempo (1-2 horas) increíblemente incomodo de jugar.

DBPirate1129,10-01-2015,"Mario Kart 7, like all the games in the Mario Kart series, is super fun and engaging and will keep you playing for years...or at least, until the next installment arrives. This entry is no exception and perhaps has even more lasting appeal with its on-the-go capabilities. How does Mario Kart 7 stand up to its predecessors and it is better than its successor? Here are the answers:

In my opinion, Mario Kart Wii is a bit better than Mario Kart 7. MK7's new courses aren't as good and the character roster is just terrible compared to the Wii entry. Characters like the Honey Queen from Super Mario Galaxy and Lakitu (who is already in the game as a referee, mind you) were just not needed. Though some may argue that the characters don't matter, I'm pretty sure most would not be impressed.

The game is far from and though. Both the new and retro selections are great (even if there are a few boring ones: Cheep Cheep Lagoon, Shy Guy Bazaar, Daisy Hills, etc.) and will keep you coming back again and again. The online is an improvement over Wii with much better connection and better retro courses to choose from. Battle mode is also better than Wii even if it has fewer stages to choose from.

It's still as fun as Mario Kart has ever been; racing and/or battling your rivals remains a joyful experience. There's also a few new items; the Fire Flower lets you pelt opponents with fireballs, the Super Leaf has your kart sprout a tail which you can use to whack nearby opponents and items, and the Lucky Seven surrounds you with seven items (a bit crazy, but it still seems fair).

The lack of a single-player VS mode is disappointing, but Mario Kart 7 is still recommended to any 3DS owner.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Hakros323,30-10-2015,"This game does have some faults, but is overall a strong game for both the Mario Kart series and the 3DS. One of the best things about the game is the online play, which is better than Mario Kart Wii. It's very addictive and fun. Players online have VR, which shows how good the player is, and will either increase or drop, depending on your finishing place.
This game does bring some new features. It introduced the Gliders that allows you to soar through the air, and you can now drive underwater.
Perhaps the biggest feature is the new Vehicle Assembly. You can pick your vehicle's Body, wheels, and glider, which can bring some unique combination.
The courses are also fun and unique, although there are some dead weight in the courses. My personal favorite is Piranha Plant Slide. The retro courses are pretty cool, too. It has GCN Daisy Cruiser, DS Waluigi Pinball, Wii Koopa Cape. Just to name a few.
However the game does have faults. Perhaps my biggest grip is the roster. The game only have 17 characters to play as, which is a big step-down from the Mario Kart Wii's roster. They kept staple characters like Daisy and Wario, as well as some fan favorites like Rosalina and Shy Guy, but also cut out beloved Mario Kart veterans like Waluigi, Toadette, Bowser Jr. & Diddy Kong. And the newcomers does not make up for that in the sightliest. The newcomers include Honey Queen, Lakitu, Wiggler, and Metal Mario. Most, if not all, of these characters, nobody asked for. This is definitely the weakest roster in the series so far.
They also cut bikes and missions, which is a disappointment.
Overall, despite some shortcomings, the game is easy to pick up, and fun to play. The graphic is marvelous and the online play is addictive. A game for everyone.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Bmaje,30-10-2015,"I never got the hype of Mario Kart, and I can't work out the point of a second one on the DS except to exploit the 3DS's rather weak, blurry 3D function. Mario Kart isn't a bad game, by any stretch, but it really doesn't do anything to add to the series, except add flying to to the Mario Kart genre... And it doesn't really do much as the flying has rather dull, unresponsive controls compared to the rest of the situations you'll find yourself in while playing the game. The roster plays like your usual who's who in the Mario Universe, and the larger characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong have slow acceleration yet high top speeds while Toad has great acceleration yet low top speeds and Mario has the best of both worlds. Does that count as a spoiler?",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

SmashBPG,28-12-2015,"Mario Kart 7 is a Must-Have if you own a System that is in the Nintendo 3DS family like a 3DS, 2DS, New, XL, just to name a few or I think that's all if them. Anyways... This game is amazing, great graphics, and perfect controls, if you played any Mario Kart Game especially Mario Kart DS, you're gonna love this game. I got this Game way back in 2011 for Christmas along with Mario Sports Mix, Pilotwings Resort, Super Paper Mario, etc. The graphics like I said is great for the 3DS. The controls are flawless and perfect. The game runs very smoothly at around 60 FPS (Frames Per Second). The new features such as the gliders, underwater racing, are cool. Hell, the jump boost from Mario Kart Wii made a return-even with the same Sounds. The Battle Mode is just fun and great. The Battle Arenas such as Wuhu Town (from Wii Fit and Wii Sports Resort), and the retro ones are awesome, as well as the tracks such as Wuhu Loop, Maka Wuhu (both of which are on Wuhu Island from Wii Sports Resort), Rosalina's Ice World, Rock Rock Mountain, and the retro ones are all awesome. The only flaw is...not having Single Player VS actually disappointed me. Online Mode is good. I have played this game for well over 100 Hours and have all 3 stars next to my name, this game truly is addictive... well at least for me. Mario Kart 7 is actually my fourth Favourite in the series, I liked 8, Double Dash and Wii slightly better but it's still a great game and if you hate MK7, you're BEYOND silly as JB.

Nintendo543,07-04-2016,"This game is pretty fun. As with all Mario Kart games, you have different modes to choose from. You can choose Time Trials, which you are trying to get the fastest time possible. Then there are the two Battle Modes, which are Coin Runners and Balloon Battles. Those are really fun for quick sessions of play. Finally, there is the Grand Prix. The Grand Prix is basically the story mode, and you are trying to get 3 Stars on each Cup. There are a few different modes for it. They are 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, and Mirror mode. 50cc is easiest, 100cc is medium, and 150cc is hard. The mirror mode is 150cc with the tracks inverted, so it'll be a tough challenge. This game also uses StreetPass, so you can see other peoples Win/Lose Ratio as well.

Sai_rox,07-05-2016,"The Mario kart series has always been a fan of mine, but this game was a little sub-par compared to all the others. First off, not the best character choices. They incorporated characters that weren't that beneficial to the Mario series, but left out some the key people that were helpful in the Mario kart series. Next, the new courses they designed weren't that good. I feel like that not the most creativity was put into this game. Courses such as Shy guy Bazaar and Daisy Hills weren't that creative in my opinion. Three retro courses were added that weren't that good in my opinion. DS ""DK Pass"", GCN ""Dino Dino Jungle"" and GCN ""Daisy Cruiser"". Also, a major glitch was show able to slip past editing in Maka Wuhu, skipping about 1/3 of the track.

While the game has some great race tracks, like DK Jungle, Neo Bowser City, Piranha Plant Slide and Rainbow Road, most MK7 tracks are quite bland and easy. It really seems Nintendo had ran out of ideas for the game. The character roster is very weak, as well. Honey Queen and Wiggler aren't very iconic Mario characters. Waluigi is a lot more iconic, and he should have been playable. But Metal Mario is easily the worst inclusion, he´s just Mario encased in metal. Battle mode is very boring, as 2-minute matches and boring stages screwed it over. VS mode is only available in multiplayer, and it's not even that good there. But the soundtrack is very decent, the graphics are great for the 3DS, and the 3D effect is very neat. Overall, the game is fun, but at the same time, is a bit lacking.

The tracks are no killer, sort of annoying really. But not annoying that will make me stop playing.

Some may say that this is the first Mario Kart game to give the opportunity to custom your ride, and for that it is excused, but as im not making comparision here: The customization options are not very large, so. thumbs down for this.

There is not many courses to choose.

The graphics are poor. Not ugly. But they definitely are not pretty. AT ALL (Here i'm comparing with some other titles that I have experienced on 3ds).

Now, thank god we can play online for free, because this basically save the gameplay and its worth to buy this game. It's fun to play online (altough i do believe TEN THOUSAND COINS is WAY too much to get a golden ride that is not even good to run)

The others types of ""courses"" such as coin rush, or coin mode, and dont recall the exaclty name, are just terrible.; no one plays that **** just mention it is give more credit than it deserves. is that terrible.

Definitely worth to buy if u have a 3ds. But not an oustanding game.

Mutty99,18-02-2021,"With an average character roster, and even if the courses are playable in Single Player only inside Gran Prix, this title is hella solid to this day. The course selection is not the best in the series, but still very good: they brought back the best tracks from both DS and Wii in the retro courses, and the new ones are charming as well, especially Music Park, the Wuhu tracks and the one-lap Rainbow Road.
I think the biggest downside is the over-exaggerated grinding for acquiring the gold parts; even if the wheels are obtainable without too many problems, the other ones require either Streetpass + Way too much time to spend online, or an unrealistic amount of coin grinding. 20k coins for the last part, when the max coins you can get from a Grand Prix is 40. Nintendo, really?
Still, Shy Guy is a fully playable racer, so I guess it's a win on both sides.

SloppyJones,31-07-2020,"This is a good game, like just about all Mario Kart games are. If you're a fan of Mario Kart, you'll like this game. However, out of Mario Kart DS, Wii, 7, and 8, which are the four I've played, I would say this is the weakest one. Honestly, most of my displeasure stems from the fact that they removed Vs. mode from this game for some reason. That really hinders the replay value of this game for me, since it means that if you want to play races without any other actual people, you have to play either Grand Prix, where you can't choose specific races to do, or Time Trials, where you don't have the CPUs to race against. My other complaint is the distinct lack of Waluigi. The core gameplay is pretty much the same as the other games before it, where you just drive around as Mario characters, hitting people with items and having a good time. The kart customization is a cool new addition, and so is being able to glide through the air and drive through water. The graphics are also very nice for a handheld console, being way better than the graphics for the DS one, and about on par with most other games on the 3DS. One part of this game that I really love is the ability to play with friends who don't have the game. You can play with them through download play, and while they can only play as Shy Guy, it's better than nothing, and has allowed me to have some good times in this game with friends who I normally wouldn't have been able to play with.

ND-Bringer,13-07-2021,"At the time it was viewed to be an utterly brilliant game, but it hasn't aged well with Mario Kart 8 Deluxe overshadowing it. Now don't get me wrong, I still think it's a good game. While the core mechanics have improved and the new gliding plus underwater driving mechanics are a blast...the variety is pretty bland this time. No missions, no simple VS matches, at least we have Balloon Battle and Shine Runners...I mean Coin Runners!The main meat of this game is the online multiplayer which can be pretty entertaining, but playing this game alone is otherwise pretty barren. Imagine if you were unable to connect with said friends. The only thing you could really do is replay cups and collect coins for random new parts. Not a bad way to kill time, I've collected over 700 coins and have only unlocked 1 new glider. I really like the customization options, but like Skylanders Imaginators, you need to wait a long time before you can unleash your customization creativity until you have the necessary parts. Even 16 cool, new tracks can get old fast. Even little problems can grow in time, like how in DS, enemies like Thwomps are shown on the bottom screen mini map, while in 7 they're no where to be seen. What if your on a long, straight path, wondering where the next turn is...AND BAM! You're hit by an out of nowhere enemy while scanning the area below. It's gets worse with trying identify the theme Nintendo is trying to create with this game. DS carries a Super Mario 64 theme, while the tracks aren't mysterious, they are rich with colorful designs. Its links with 64's adventure theme. If you play Kart DS after 64 or 64 DS, it's a really wonderful game combo since they carry similar spirits. 7 on the other hand is a mash between Galaxy, 3D Land, Mario Kart Wii's shadow art style. There's not enough room on a handheld system to fit all of that together. I also would've preferred mainly 3D Land theme as well as having a similar colorful art style so it at least could carry a decent theme that's a treat for the eyes. This shoddy art style feels bland somehow. 3DS kids games should have flourishing colors not serious shadows. That's better suited for E10 and teen games. That's the least of this game's problems. The character selection may not be the worst, but where is Waluigi? He has his own killer track now, this isn't Smash Bros, many people count on him being a playable character! Remember how irritating it was when DK wasn't a playable character in Mario Party after 4 until 10 came along? He's no sideshow attraction! Even though he was in the first game. Seriously, the Honey Queen was that important to make a new character? I may love unlocking new characters, but there is little thrill to be found here. The rest of the characters may be cool, however unlocking them is a challenge with unbalanced difficulty. It's not that hard, heck the com difficulty feels a lot easier compared to DS. New characters except for the Mii, can only be unlocked by claiming 1st place cups from the 150cc Grand Prix. In DS, characters and karts are unlocked with each completed cup from easy to hard. Giving the racer a sense of growth while playing through the game. But here in 7 all the challenges are at hard difficulty. Making the journey feel one-minded and frustrating inexperienced players. I still remember tasting defeat every day while trying to complete these cups.It just makes things stressful with this unbalanced difficulty. Even after collecting a ton of coins after a cup you're not guaranteed to get a new part, its uninspiring to get better at this game unless you have some friends to compete with. As for the tracks, we got a decent selection of new and old tracks. At least Waluigi Pinball made it into this game! DK's jungle reboot stage is great! But he's strangely calm that the Tiki Tak Tribe is attacking his island this time. Also, Wuhu Island is a great setting and all, but do you really need to add 3 Wii Sports themed stages? I'll say it a game, this game needs more variety. If you want to add another Rainbow Road stage, despite all of the tension they create, I can live with that. But I don't know if everyone remembers Pilot Wings and Wii Sports Resort all too well. Point is, I didn't love this game like DS. The driving and multiplayer mechanics may have improved, but without that, this game would have nothing to stand on. I will give it credit for giving birth to 8, but today its a fallen king that's likely to stay down and leave its kingdom to the next heir. But this king hasn't aged well. Great at the time, but its just not as enjoyable as DS. It may have better control, but you're in for underwhelming experience compared this series last Mario Kart handheld game. Even after winning all the cups in 1st place with my Bowser Jr. Mii, I not really satisfied. This game failed to appeal to me. Sadly it will forever live in Mario Kart 8's Deluxe's shadow.

It is extremely easy to accidentally engage the Gyro controls while steering with the 3DS’ control stick. Some of the new tracks are split into sections rather than laps, adding a new challenge to the series that was carried over into Mario Kart 8. Overall, the wonky controls and atrocious character roster makes this easily one of the worst entries in the Mario Kart series.",1,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Kdog152,22-12-2022,"Let's start with the negatives just to get them out if the way:
- Mk7 has the worst Mushroom cup in the series next to Super Mario Kart on the NES: Toad circuit, is an alright track, Daisy Hills is decent, Cheep cheep lagoon is bland and bad, and Shy guy bazaar is an overrated track, it's just mediocre.
-Mission mode from Mario kart ds still hasn't been brought back.
- Blue spiny shells are too common. Literally though, I swear like 5 spawn a race sometimes and that's not an exaggeration.
-There's still a time limit in Balloon battle and you still respawn when all your balloons are popped. Like why? Why can't it be like Mario Kart Ds where you had no time limit and it was a game of elimination? Once you lost your balloons, you where out.
- There is no VS mode!!!! (unless your playing online or on multi player). WHY!!!! this means there is less replayability in this version.
- Why didn't they have bikes return from Mario Kart Wii?
Now for the positives:
First of all the gliding and Underwater mechanic is a great idea that works really well, however, the water one is underutilized. This new gimmick means that the courses can be more expansive and less flat.
The fact that you can now customize your vehicle now is awsome and leads to some really creative kart combinations.
While this game has a small and weird character roster, all the choices are good (apart from Honey Queen)
Besides the mushroom cup, this game has some really creative and fun tracks, such as Wario Shipyard/ Galleon, Maka wuhu/ Wuhu Mountain loop, Rock rock Mountain, Melody Motorway/ Music Park, Mario's circuit etc and it has the best Rainbow road in the series. I mean, Rainbow road in this game is phenomenal. You get to ride on Saturn's rings and literally drive on the moon and there are some really good shortcuts as well.
The Online in this game is surprisingly functional and fun, it's very rare that you get hackers.
For once coins are actually useful, you unlock kart parts by collecting them.
This game has a really good selection of retro tracks.
in conclusion, while this is one of the weaker Mario karts, it's still a good one.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MarioReviewer,20-11-2022,"In the Mario Kart series, Mario Kart 7 is not talked about enough. Just because Mario Kart 8... well... exists, 7 just gets shrugged off as 'It's on the 3DS, it's meh.' . However, I feel like Mario Kart 7 has the best tracks of any Mario Kart, including Wii Coconut Mall, DS Airship Fortress and of course the sublime Rainbow Road. Move over, Mario Kart Wii (or Super Circuit if you're an OG), because this one is packed with joyful... goodness...? Anyway, this game also introduced the paraglider and underwater sections, which the paraglider I absolutely love, yet the underwater sections being lacking and just the overworld with slower karts and annoying fish. I'm glad they haven't shut down the online (yet), because it's so fun to square off against other people just like you who probably has been questioned for carrying about a 3DS, but when you show them your shiny Mario Kart game they apologize and leave you alone. Also, the battle mode is a battle mode. The battle mode is fun sometimes, but I really couldn't care less about it when you already have a bunch of joyful grand prix cups to play (especially this game) and some ol' time trials. Overall, in terms of design, gameplay and battle mode, this game is *takes deep breath*... better than Mario Kart 8 (Deluxe).",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

SealedLooks,20-01-2023,"Mario Kart 7 had big shoes to fill. With the enormous succes of the DS console and with that the succes of Mario Kart DS, there was some pressure on the new 3D Mario Kart. Not only was MKDS a fast paced racing game wich fitted the DS very well, it was (together with the MKWII) the most inovative mario kart yet, at least on the handhelds it was. Unfortunatly for MK7, now that we know how MK8 and deluxe looks like, the first hit it has to take is the visuals. It is a obvious upgrade in comparison with MKDS, but that was really it. It doesnt do much for me, also because MKDS makes up for the visuals in some aspects with a lot of character, wich MK7 has way less of. Not only is the music mainly reused, but i found most of the new made maps not really inovative nor intresting, it is a given at least some of new maps in an MK will play and look cool, but (again) if you compare in with MK8, it has way less going for it. Some new aspects were decent. It introduced the glider aspects, and that does add a new mechanic to the game, and can work in your favor if you do it correct. The 'double drift boost' is also introduced here, wich is probably the best thing about the gameplay next to it using a joystick and taking very good advantage of that. But unfortunately i did not like the character selection nor did i like almost the entire feeling this game gives off. it has a blant cover and a boring menu if you ask me. It still is for me a pretty good mario kart, it still is a game you should have because you can put so many hours in it, but for me it does a little bit more than the minimum required to get you hooked. Good, but not fantastic or groundbreaking in almost any aspect",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Single player is really fun even if you get bored of it, every once in a while is still fun. But the REAL highlight of the game is... the multiplayer. Multiplayer is as fun as ever, probably even better. Multiplayer is the same as ever: 4 player chaos in creative courses with mind-boggling items and newly made anti-gravity sections. Anti-gravity is as it sounds like, karts racing on walls and upside down, its not really a HUGE thing in my opinion but its a well made new and fresh idea. Online mode is a mode where you race aginst people Worldwide, Regionally, with Friends or in Tournaments. Worldwide is where you race with people around the world, Regionally is where I assume is where you race with people from your continent, with friends is with people you have played with randomly and people in your Friend List, and Tournaments is where you race with a set amount of rules and gain points to see in which place you landed.

nigelgrab,27-07-2014,"Mario Kart has successfully made itself feel brand new, more than any prior release in the series. The gameplay is familiar yet fresh and exciting, and the anti-gravity sections actually feel good - slightly more floaty and drifty than normal, but still a joy to control. The latter goes for all the gameplay - finding your style of play and a kart combination to match it is just awesome.
However, the replay value is actually fairly lacking, due to a disappointing battle mode that feels tacked on and empty, and no extra modes different to past entries. So pretty much once you complete every grand prix (and mirror mode if you're into that) you're left with nothing else worthwhile.

Hakros323,22-11-2015,"This game is another must have for anyone who is one of the following:
Likes Mario
Likes racing games
Have a Wii U
Or all of the above.
Mario Kart 8 is one of the best games in the Mario Kart series, and heres why:
The graphics are AMAZING. It's absolutely breathtaking, and the littlest details were perfect. The retro courses and a beauty makeover too, and they look better than ever.
The courses are all awesome, fun, and unique. Its hard to choose a favorite! It does have the best Bowser Castle IMO, and while this Rainbow Road can be a bit lackluster compared to other rainbow roads, it's still good. The Retros courses were....eh....but I'm sure there's some courses that fans are happy to have back.
Like Mario Party 7, the online play for Mario kart 8 is great. Compete is races and battles with many players around the world. You can join online Tournaments and even make your own.
This game introduced the Anti-Gravity feature. With this feature, you can race virtually on any surface. Driving on walls and ceilings, this makes the race even more fun, and it's a interesting feature.
And customize your kart feature returned from Mario Kart 7. You can make your own unique kart combination.

There's a few flaws this game does suffer from, though. Namely, the Roster and Battle mode.
The roster, while way better than Mario Kart 7, still lacks some fan favorites like Bowser Jr., Diddy Kong, Boo, & Dry Bones. Although they did return Toadette and Waluigi. But the newcomers introduced are, well, bad. The Koopalings make their first playable apperance, which is good if you like them, but if you don't care about them, that 1/3 of the roster you're not going to like. There's a lot of baby characters in the game, all 4 babies from Mario Kart Wii returns along with Baby Rosalina. It's good if you like cute characters, but they're generally unwanted. Aaaand there's Pink Gold Peach, a character that NOONE wanted. So......roster still needs work.
And the battle mode? While is previous installments, you battle on courses made FOR battle mode, this installment, you battle on courses made for racing, with a few adjustments made. Not very creative.

But this is still a strong game for the Wii U. Get it if you have one.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

mvpeter24,05-07-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is a total anomaly.

On a system totally devoid of good games, MK8 shines. This is not just the best game on Wii U, but the best Mario Kart ever, and one of the most polished and fun Nintendo games ever made.

Mario Kart 7 tried to mix up the very well-tread Mario Kart formula by adding underwater and air-based sections to many courses. This installment continues that trend, keeping the air and water sections while adding anti-gravity sections into the mix. All the sudden courses that you could never imagine are a reality, as racers ride their karts all over the walls and ceilings.

But these changes in gameplay aren't even the thing that makes this the greatest Mario Kart yet. What really makes this game stand out are the new tracks. In previous games, I found it easy to pick out the 3-4 ""best tracks"" in the game. In this game, there is no such thing. It seems like every track is so unique, colorful, and carefully crafted that you could never make a list of the ""best."" Even the retro tracks are incredible. This game breathes new life into some of the best historical Mario Kart tracks, reimagining them in HD in ways you never even thought about when playing their 16-or-64 bit counterparts (I'm looking at you, Ribbon Road).

The visuals are probably the best on Wii U, showing off impressive realistic-looking lighting effects on courses that burst with color and charm. You never wanted any more out of a Mario Kart game, and it leaves you wondering if graphics can ever get better than what we have here.

The music in this game is unbelieveable. Nintendo started orchestrating their music with Super Mario Galaxy in 2007, but it took a long time for that shift to catch on in their other properties. 2008's Mario Kart Wii and 2011's Mario Kart 7 still featured MIDI-based music. This installment marks the first orchestrated Mario Kart game, and it sounds good. So good, in fact, you'll be dying to get the soundtrack.

In a world where DLC is treated like the devil, Nintendo has given us DLC in this game that any gamer would dream about. For $12, one can purchase an additional 16 tracks for the game, essentially boosting the total content of the game by 50%. These bonus packs keep up the quality that the other courses have, and are an absolute must-own.

If you made the mistake of buying a Wii U, this game is a must-have. Hell, this game was so much fun that you might consider buying a Wii U just to play it. Just be weary that this is about the only good game on the system.

It unfortunately uses the same maps that you race on, and Nintendo even misses its chance to make a ""Battle-Dome"" where you can drive up the wall, upside-down on the roof and etc. Vehicles in Battle-mode are also very slow, and are lacking any options to change this.

All in all though, this is a great game, and it might end up being one of my favourite games of this generation.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

They're far from the standard copy/paste from the past, and each of them have been retrofitted with the new things this game brings, while still maintaining their original feel. Nintendo clearly put a lot of time, effort, and thought into this game, and it deserves every last cent that I've spent on it- and I haven't even STARTED The multiplayer yet!

niemand2014,05-06-2014,"Why Mario Kart 8 is the best of the Mario Kart series? Because it summes up the best of all previous titles, has high quality content (in terms of tracks, drivers, animations, ...) and most of all it has an improved game balancing!

Tracks
The 16 new tracks (plus the 16 remade maps, of cource) are amazing: Great Level Design, great Production Design, and each track has tons of unique visual content! One of my favorites is the one that reminds everyone of the Sugar Rush game in the Wreck-it-Ralph movie. Considering the rather low performance of the Wii U, Mario Kart 8 looks just beautiful: Textures, Shaders and Animations were made with passion definitely. Moreover, the gameplay of the new tracks are very much convincing, offering various challenges, shortcuts and game elements that are unique for each level, such as the Giant Bowser literally hitting the road in Bowsers' Castle.

Replay-Mode
What a great idea: After finishing a race, you can either see a replay of one of the drivers in full length, or configure parameters for a clip that the game will create automatically and that depicts some of the most interesting situations that occured. While playing the clip, you can pause, reward, forward AND slow down the playback. Especially the latter ends in VERY funny laughing fits when playing with friends. Seeing players get bashed, raging around with power-ups or having incredible comebacks in the last lap at slow motion is fun and a (meta-)gaming experience at its best!

Balancing
Finally! 1) Getting of the track (/the course), like by falling into the deep, doesn't make you go for the last place anymore. 2) Items now keep the balance between being too powerful and being too lame, still keeping enough space for surprises. 3) The racers nearly always drive in a quite narrow field, fostering the tension. But: You won't rotate from place 8 to place 2 to place 7 to place 1 all the time. Mario Kart 8 races always feel like very fair yet exciting, thrilling and surprising challenges. Finally!

Drivers and everything else
Just AWESOME.

There is still much more to write about this game, but it's simply not necessary, because nearly everything can be judged favourably. I would give it a 11 out of 10. Unfortunatelly, there are no distinct arena tracks for the good old multiplayer balloon battle (first known from Mario Kart 64). So let's say: 10 points.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MrTexasRanger,30-05-2014,"Phenomenal. Absolutely spectacular game. Exactly what I was hoping for from the 8th installment of the Mario Kart series. I was able to play through half the courses in one sitting, and the rest in another and ended very content with the results. The game looked amazing, ran like a joy, and had a great soundtrack (heavily influenced by the trumpet). I've yet to do too much focus on the multi-player as I am currently enjoying single player. Now as amazing as this game is, I do have merely 3 complaints as no game is truly perfect.

A. The zero-gravity/hover mode was visually impressive, but did not effect the aesthetics of the racing. You are still racing on a standard curvy track it just looks fancy. On that note the retro tracks could use a bit more zero-gravity.

B. Battle mode. If you've played this game, the title explains itself. They done-goofed the battle mode. The courses are no longer fun and interesting square arenas, but are portions of the courses itself. Completely shattered my nostalgia from battle mode.

C. Why all the mini bowser/bowser relatives? I don't have the character list in-front of me, but there are I want to say 6-7 bowser relative characters from the New Super Mario Bros series. These seem like wasted space as they easily could've included more characters from series' such as Super Mario Galaxy/Sunshine.

That's it for the negative. Those are really minor complaints in the grand scheme of things as overall, this is the most I've enjoyed myself in a video game in quite some time. I can't help but smile and let the nostalgia overflow me as I play this nearly perfect installation in one of my all-time favorite series'.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Gameplay is classic Mario Kart, but with a couple new items and elements that always keeps things interesting and on your toes. The level designs are almost awe-inspiring on a visual level and a whole lotta fun. If there is ANYTHING keeping me from giving this a perfect 10, it'd be the fact that the current character roster is saturated with Baby versions of characters already there. It make the selection of characters feel...lacking, and not really diverse. But that's a nitpicky issue, as they are all balanced better than ever before. For those on the fence for buying a Wii U, this is absolutely worth the ticket price. The engine is efficient (60 FPS for 1-2 players local and single-player) and looks as good, if not better than, most next-gen games currently available. It's also more fun than ANY Xbox One or PS4 game out now, and the best part is it'll keep on giving for years to come, especially with the strong possibility of DLC in the coming future.

Pros: The visuals. Wow. It looks amazing. The races. The Characters. Multiplayer etc.
Cons: The battle mode. This is the thing that held it back from a 10. They put actual race tracks in the game instead of those cube tracks. This results to instead battling it out with your friends, you drive through the track hoping you find them. And even you do find them, they're just gonna zoom past you.

eirikwatz,08-06-2014,"Striking colors, fantastic music and unabashed fun, that is whats waiting for you in Mariokart 8.

Mariokart 8 is fantastic game showing that a series in its 8th installment can still come up with fresh ideas and deliver such a high dosage of pure gaming joy. in a time where the trend to bash on Nintendo for being ""unoriginal"" and ""behind the times"" its refreshing to see a game without the mountains of blood, gore and excessive dlc and microtrnsactions from a AAA publisher.

Let's pretend you have never played a game in the mariokart series. What does it play like? well mariokart (and almost every kart racer) builds upon the idea of crazy physics and over the top tracks that you duke it out on, often with some sort of item/weapon system. strategic use of items and Mastering of inline drifting is top priority.

while the same basic concept remains the same for mariokart 8, it's still the most refreshing kart game i have played in years. The antigravity feature may not seem to be much of a change at first, but its how much it plays in with gliding and underwater portins that makes it all work together. while mariokart 7 also had the gliding and underwater sections, it never really meshed. But with the antigravity in mariokart 8 it manages to transition seamlessly from one to the other without it feeling like thoughtless addon.

aside from thye new features what improvement does this 8th installment in this gaming megaseries bring to the table? for me it was the changes made to how items and drifting work. in past mariokart games you had the ability to pick up an item, shield you back with it and pick up another item in your hand, ready to blast anyone brave enough to slip past your defenses. This made first place almost invincible and impervious to attacks. not this time though as you can only pick up one item at a time, leveling the playing field. but as a consolation for the nefarious shell and banana fortresses they have the superhorn, an item so glorious, so magnificent it shattered the mind of many a mariokart fan, sending tears of gratitude from battle worn eyes. This item is able block the dreaded blue spine shell. halleluja!

As mentioned earlier the other major improvement to this game lies the improvemt made the drifting system, the bikes in particular. in previous installments bikes had the ability to inline drift, makeing them superior to karts in every way. this is fixed in mariokart 8 by giving every new vehicle type its own advantagea and weaknesses. bikes have better drifting, ATV's have better traction rough terrain and recover faster from slipping of the course into mud or grass. regular karts have better overall stats on every field and have an advantage when racing straight ahead on regular asphalt. of course each character also brings their own stats and preferences for vehicles. this makes this the most ballanced mariokart to date. cpu's are still terminators hunting the player down though.

the graphics in mariokart 8 is some of the best graphics i have ver seen in a video game eve. no its not the most technicaly advanced graphics ever seen, but its still gorgeous and proves the wiiu is no slouch when compared to the ps4 and xb1. the creativity that is put into the design of each track, both graphicaly and from a gameplay standpoint is mindblowing. even the the retro courses have been remade with new features and gorgeous HD visuals.

the online is probably the best nintendo has ever had, you can customize EVERYTHING in the different modes, from item selection to tournament rules and times. i ahve experienced no lag or dropping and have not had any conectivity issues over my long play sessions of this game.

there is only one issue i have with this game and that is a big one for some people. they completely ruines the battle mode. no more custom made arenas designed for crazy deathmatches and high intensity weapon slinging. instead you batle it out on the tracks from racing mode. this makes battle kode slow and tedious and completely unplayable with less than 12 characters. once the player count dips below it becomes more of a match of finding someone in an empty nothingness compared to the chaotic fun of previous battle modes.

all in all this is a fantastic game and a testament to nintendo's creativity and skill in game design, showing us why they still reign when it comes to making an actaully fun game and not barely interactive ""cinematic experiences"" that is so popular today. if not for the lackluster battle mode this would have gotten a 10 out of 10, but it seems nothing can reach perfection. a stellar game worth every buck for years to come. a definite BUY.

1 - The character selection is a bit lackluster. How about Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Boo, Birdo, ROB, etc.?

IntelligntGamer,30-05-2014,"I could write this review using a single word.

Fantastic.

But it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't describe the colossal amount of effort Nintendo has gone to to make Mario Kart 8 the prettiest game on Wii U, even prettier than Super Mario 3D World, the prior graphical showcase Wii U owners like me would use to show off what the console could really do if people just tried. From the character models to the fact that this game runs in 60 frames per second, even in split screen two player, Mario Kart 8 is now the go-to-game to show people that Wii U can rival even the PS4 when it comes to graphical prowess. The fact that this came out the same week as Watch Dogs, which looks last gen even on the PS4, makes this all the sweeter.

It wouldn't be enough to tell you about the little graphical flourishes Nintendo have sprinkled throughout the world, so little that you don’t really notice them but they help bring the world to life. Things like Donkey Kong’s fur or Mario’s mustache rustling in the wind as their kart zooms around the track. The little background animations that don’t need to be there but are. The word “fantastic” would encompass these things, surely, but wouldn't tell you how impressive it is in its subtlety.

It wouldn't let you know that the racing controls in this game are spot-freaking-on, just as they have been in every Mario Kart since the halcyon days of the N64.

“Fantastic” wouldn’t explain how great the music is, from the synthesized beats of the Electrodome to the orchestral music of Cloudtop Cruise.

Nor would it be enough to tell you how easy the online matchmaking is, putting more “adult” games like Titanfall to shame. Or how well online multiplayer runs. Or just how fun it is.

Fantastic wouldn’t tell you where Mario Kart 8 stumbles, either. The most obvious stumble is Battle Mode, a multiplayer favorite since the original Mario Kart came out on the SNES. Whereas previous iterations of Battle Mode had custom built arenas, here Battle Mode is reduced to reconfigured versions of the Grand Prix mode tracks. It’s such an obvious fumble that you wonder why Nintendo even bothered to include Battle Mode if they were going to half-arse it like this.

There’s also the use of the Gamepad; in the sense that apart from being a horn or being the usual avenue for off-TV play, it’s not really utilised as well as it could be. How about a reverse camera option, so you can always see what’s happening behind you? What about a local 2 player mode that allows one player to play on the TV and the other on the Gamepad? Great ideas that aren’t there for some reason.

Mario Kart 8 may also prove the adage that you can have too much of a good thing. Some criticized Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS of having too few characters, but here there may be too many. Choice is always nice, but the fact that there are five different baby characters, and six of the Koopalings, makes the character choice seem a bit superfluous. There are differences between all the characters, of course, but when the differences are so subtle because of the large variety of characters to chose from, you end up wishing for less.

There’s the consistent problem of the enemy AI being all knowing. I’ve always seen single player Mario Kart as Me vs. 8+ computer characters working as one. This problem becomes all the more obvious when you start making it to the front of the pack. For example, Mario Kart veterans know that the only time you get items like the Blue Shell, or the Lightning Bolt, are when you’re at the back of the pack. When you’re all the way back there, you can’t really know what’s going on in first. So it’s insane that when you’re leading the race, and about to jump over a precarious jump, that a Lightning Bolt hits you at just the right time to see you spin out and fall to your doom. There’s no other word for that than unfair; fantastic is definitely not apropos.

A minor niggle I have… and it’s really minor… is the fact that the default menu choice following a race is the Replay button. If you’re anything like me, you’re constantly hitting A trying to speed up your progression to the next race. Mario Kart 8 looks set to break me of that habit, since starting a replay of the race just ends up slowing me down. The replay feature is a nice feature, don’t get me wrong; the ability to edit and share videos on Youtube and Miiverse is especially cool. But it’s not the main game.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is fantastic. Just fantastic. It’s pure fun. The new anti-grav feature is arguably a gimmick, but when it bends your mind (and the course) it’s just, well, fantastic fun. Mario Kart 8 stumbles in a few places, but the overall package is one of quality and substance. It’s a game all Wii U owners should be buying right now, and it’s a game that should make non-Wii U owners rush out and buy the console right now.

Fantastic. Get it now.

Bellachichi,31-05-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is my favorite game in the franchise. This game is an absolute blast at every turn. The 16 new courses are gorgeous, and the 16 remastered courses are all changed enough to make it feel like a brand new experience, with just the right amount of nostalgia. Online play so far has been working flawlessly, and new games start in less than a minute.

My only gripes is the character roster and the battle mode. The roster is filled with babies, koopalings, and metal characters. Which are okay, but when these characters take up the space of fan favorites like Dry Bones, Boo, and Birdo, I start to think that maybe we don't need 5 baby characters. And the battle mode is significantly different, now taking place on actual tracks from the game instead of in a fixed arena. It's difficult to catch people when you either have to tail behind them, or they zip past you going the opposite way.

These issues are easy to look past, as the core gameplay and track design is better than it has ever been. This game is pure unadulterated fun, and is definitely worth your time as a Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It's a gift that is so rare nowadays, yet never goes under-appreciated. Mario Kart 8 is the prime example of this. It delivers with such poise that it makes you wonder if the Wii U was ever on struggle street. Titles like Mario Kart 8 are what bring supposedly doomed consoles back to life. Every game has its issues, and Mario Kart 8 is no exception. But when the magic of Nintendo shines through, there isn't anything that makes you feel let down. For over 30 years, Nintendo have been the kings of game development, and Mario Kart 8 shines brightly with every other classic gem they've ever made. Kudos to you, Nintendo.

kayymoneyy,30-05-2014,"It's always a god feeling when a console gets a timeless classic of a game like Mario Kart 8 is. This game adds to an already great, underrated lineup of games for the Wii U. The first thing I noticed when I threw the game in was the graphics. Finally, an HD version of a Mario Kart series that easily gets a spot in my top 10 all time greatest game series. The courses are beautiful and you find yourself admiring just how good everything looks mid-race. The critics definitely nailed the key point here, the fact that you're getting everything you loved from past games in the series while giving you more features like customization and a couple new power ups. This is the first in the series where, in my observation, can be master of the controls in the former Mario Karts but will have a bit of a learning curve with this installment. You have to be a bit more careful on the turns when first starting up, but if you recently polished your skills with one of the older Mario Karts, you'll catch on by your 2nd or 3rd cup qualifier.

The anti-gravity elements are in my opinion not emphasized enough in gameplay, say when go upside down your camera realigns with the track so it looks like your driving normally so it's more like a underlining concept to keep the series and action ticking.

PolisKanin,07-06-2014,"Fun enjoyable gameplay. This is my favourite Mario Kart yet (previously it was Mario Kart 64). The gameplay is enjoyable alone, but best played with friends or being competitive online. The only flaws are the poor roster (full of babies, metal mario and the aweful pink gold peach) and in battle mode you can only play on race courses rather than courses specifically designed for it like previous installments in the series. This leads to you driving around trying to find someone for the whole match, and when you do it's someone on your team, but you're so happy that you have found someone so you throw an item anyway, but it harms them as items aren't on team. However, battle mode isn't the main feature in Mario Kart, and the roster can be forgiven by the fact you can play as Mii, which have almost endless customization possibilities.

I thought for sure I was going to have to sell my Wii U but this game really turned it around for me. The game itself is standard Mario Kart, with a small twist ""anti gravity"" while this didn't really break any grounds for me it was a cool feature and was a lot better alternative then flying as they had in sonic racing. The drift system is pretty cool I wish they would have added a 3rd boost option for drifting vs the 2 stages that currently exist. I have unlocked just about anything the ghosts were not too difficult to beat it was more of a ""showing you all possible paths in a given course"". I still have not accomplished 3 stars on all 150 cc mirror events but have completed regular 150cc and the rubber banding can be pretty ridiculous at times, but RNG is RNG. The online play is smooth for me I have not seen much lag or any kind of frustrating mechanics beyond the normal MK8 experience. I'm still waiting to get the 10k coins to unlock the last item. Overall the game is great! Fun with friends or with strangers and even with some of the same annoying mechanics regarding the rubber band feature its definitely not as strict as it's previous Wii release.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

dmelendez34,24-06-2014,"If battle mode was better, this game would get a 10 from me. Not having special battle mode areas was the worst idea Nintendo had. I would have preferred they simply reused the areas from past games at least than having players race around tracks.

The tracks are great = the new ones are beautiful and creative and the old ones are touched up to make them more enjoyable.

Gotohellcadz,16-06-2014,"A solid game offering a fantastic graphics and controls. It's only shortcoming come from the butchered battle mode and last lustre multiplayer features and awkward roster additions/changes. As while the multiplayer in it has evolved and lost the majority of it's networking issues what happened to the community system from mk7? It worked great and they had every opportunity to work on that but instead we're left with a tournament feature which while it does work for setting up game tournaments it doesn't for managing your community of players for game nights on the clock. I did also have a few nit picks with the item system this time around as while I'm glad they nerfed blue shells into the ground item pickups across different race placings is broken (5th place gets a bullet bill, 8th get's a single banana) focusing more on defensive drops rather than mario kart's previous offense with the majority of drops being shells. My last issue is that they removed a lot of the fan classic characters and tracks. We only get one snes track (donut plains 3) which is terrible when considering the other snes tracks and the retro and new tracks as a whole don't have many standouts. But you probably know all the pros with the game, like amazing graphics tight control etc. If you own a wii u this is a must buy.

DestinationMarc,30-06-2014,"I really enjoyed this game! Now, it does have its issues, but first, what's good about it; the controls are nearly similar to Mario Kart Wii, and while I was worried about this, the underwater/parasail segments from Mario Kart 7 were actually easilly controllable. The visuals? Amazing. It is SO enjoyable playing a Mario Kart game in beautiful HD! The new items were cool, though I personally find the fireball item a bit useless; maybe it's just me, but unless you have good aim or just get lucky, it's pretty difficult to hit opponents with it. The new levels are just GLORIOUS; Electrodrome is my personal favorite track! I'd also like to mention that the online functionality is WAY more improved from MKWii's; I love the tournament option personally! The anti-gravity is a cool feature, but honestly, though not to this degree, I've seen the concept before in another racing game, Crash Nitro Kart, sideways tires and all! Now, on to the bad; first and foremost, the battle mode. Everyone's said this already, and my opinion's no exception, but I think it was a bad idea to implement actual racetracks as battle courses instead of arenas. Secondly, when you're first place in a race, you'll usually get coins as items, which can be real frustrating, especially when you're trying to defend yourself. Also, Rainbow Road? Not exactly a challenge, which is considered a nitpick, but c'mon; everyone knows Rainbow Road is the craziest course in any Mario Kart game! So, all-in-all, while I'd like to give this game a 10, personally, those major issues do hold the game back a bit.

cwepahguy225,05-07-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is awesome. The course design is great and creative. The character roster is the biggest yet, and has the Koopalings as playable characters (for the first time ever). However, there are too many baby characters (and what about Birdo, Diddy, Hammer Bro, and Dry Bones)? Even though anti gravity doesnt bring any massive changes, it's still fun and I love it. It was like ""the glue that connected hang gliding and underwater racing"". Gamexplain said that. The tracks are incredibly detailed, making the game more like the real world. The music and graphics are both stunning. The game does have some cons though. You can't carry a backup item anymore, which sucks. Also, first place gets less items. The big downside is battle mode. Battle mode is ruined. It uses slightly modified courses instead of arenas. Also, the cpus are way too good, there aim w/ green shells is perfect. They need to be nerfed.

The online mode offers great competition and excellent replay value. Now for the downside, some tracks look muggy and there's an unnecessary use of the anti gravity in some tracks. The online mode lacks voice chat during the race, I would've enjoyed vocally taunting some players. The online mode does suffer from lag depending on the region you play in.

frogvsmosquito,12-09-2014,"Before I got Mario Kart 8, the only experience i had with Mario Kart was playing it on my friend's DS. And that previous experience was positive. This, however, is even better. It's all I remember from the DS game and a lot more.
The first thing you'll notice when you start racing is the antigravity. Antigravity sections work differently than the others. Colliding into your opponents would normally be a bad idea, but in antigravity when you collide into an opponent, you'll both get a little speed boost, so use it wisely to get ahead!
The game has 32 tracks (16 new and 16 retro). Tracks have so much variety. On one track you'll find yourself in a world made out of sweets, on the other you'll be racing through pipes avoiding Piranha Plants, on the other one you'll be on a big floating track above the city, you name it! And with the new DLC coming, which will add 16 more tracks, expect to be racing through Hyrule!
Online multiplayer is one of the best I've seen. Didn't. Crash. Once. And the feeling when you finish first, ahead of experts... it's so satisfying. You can also either participate in tournaments, or you can create your own for others to compete in. Rule settings are pretty detailed such as race class, time when tournament begins/ends, number of races... You can also bring a friend to play online with you in the same room! Oh the laughs, rages, ups and downs...
The only thing I don't like is the battle mode. The goal is to pop other player's balloons. This time, instead of specially designed battle arenas, you'll be battling on one of the 8 selected tracks. It can take a while for someone to pass so you can pop the opponent's balloon. Or you can hide behind a rock or something and wait for some clueless Mushroom kingdom resident to pass and pop his balloons. Hehehe...
Overall, very good game that you should own if you have a Wii U.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Forbod,22-09-2014,"While i'm a huge fan of most Nintendo games I have to say that Mariokart 8 was a bit of a let down. Don't let the massive hype and undying fan-dom of people fool you into thinking that all Nintendo games are super fantastic perfect games. While Mariokart 8 sported great graphics and fun gameplay. It did however lack in the character department sporting many unpopular Bowser spawns and baby versions of characters. But what really destroyed my love for this game is the realization that the game purposefully punishes winners and rewards losers during a race via the power up system. Whereas if you are holding 1st place you have a 90% chance of receiving just coins (Even if you have your max 10/10 coins) from the power-up cubes and a 0% chance of getting any strong power ups. The best you may receive is a single mushroom boost or a green shell but those are very very rare. This leaves anyone trying to hold 1st at a huge disadvantage and completely defenseless and usually easily beat at the last stretch of the race unless the person in 1st is a extremely far ahead.

All and all I kinda regret paying 60 bucks for this game and the only real fun i get from is it playing with friends locally.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Mariofan,07-02-2015,Mario Kart 8 is one of those games that you should get a Wii U for. It is a great game. The graphics are so good. The gameplay is awesome. The character selection isn't that great. The track selection is the best. Mario Kart 8 is awesome and is definitely worth buying.

BeanTheDuck,04-06-2015,The same old Mario Kart is here with almost nothing new and it is more boring than ever but is pretty to look at because of the HD. I would recommend the DS and 3DS game over this WIIU title.,5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Lots of tracks and a decent AI that does not seem to cheat too much, as the old MK games did. The Game lacks a proper Battle mode and it's a shame and disgrace towards all fans of the series to skip this in favor for a""new and innovative"" battle mode, which demonstrably have been proven quite boring by too many players, including me. A question for Nintendo, where is the classic battle map DLC or any hints regarding a possibility ? The 7 out of 10 score from me is due to the great singleplayer experience.

MEFzelder,09-05-2016,"Desde ""Mario Kart 64"" no encontraba un juego de carreras que me atrapara tanto, esta nueva versión tiene una manejo muy suave y responsable que hace que sea fácil de aprender y dominar, sin mencionar el detalle puesto en cada pista haciendo que cada escenario sea entretenido y vistoso.
""Mario Kart 8"" es uno de los juegos que mejor cumplió en cuanto a ejecución, a pesar de que la Wii U no sea tan potente como sus rivales generacionales el juego se reproduce en unos fluidos 60 frames por segundo, y solo se reduce a 40 cuando son 4 las personas que estan jugando en simultaneo. El juego utiliza la fórmula de siempre carrera de kartings con items con diferentes funciones que hacen que la carrera sea competitiva y cambiante en cada momento, con la incorporación de 32 pistas, de las cuales 16 son remakes de pistas de versiones anteriores.
Uno de los puntos fuertes de esta versión es la diversidad para construir tu competidor ideal, no solo puedes balancear el vehículo a tu gusto sino que se agregaron dos pesos a los tradicionales corredores livianos, medios y pesados, sumando peso pluma y muy pesados. Otra mecánica es la secciones de 0 gravedad donde el vehículo anda de cabeza pero debido a que la cámara te sigue siempre detrás y con la misma perspectiva no me produce ninguna diferencia con ir sobre tierra.
El punto más débil del juego es el modo batalla, debido a que no hay niveles planeados para este modo, se reutilizan las pistas de carreras generando situaciones muy aburridas para atacarte con items porque es muy difícil coincidir con tus rivales, este modo es totalmente olvidable.
A pesar de lo malo del modo batalla este juego es un ""Must have"", es de lo mejor en cuanto a jugabilidad y gráficamente, ideal para competir en línea o local con amigos.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Mikeylano,02-06-2014,"Most reviews fail to point out any of MK8's flaws. I shall attempt to do so. Nevertheless, I bought the Wii U specifically for this game and I am glad I did. It is a masterpiece, but it is not perfect.

Everything is great, except for:

- Ability to hold a weapon in reserve: Now you can only hold one item at a time. You cannot hold, for example, a banana behind you for defence whilst hitting an item box to get something else in reserve. This feature was removed unnecessarily. Now, if you are in 1st, you simply hold on to whatever defensive item you get, rather than attempting to sabotage 2nd place (in fear that you may get a coin). This makes the game significantly less tactical.

- No on-screen map: whilst there is a map on the game pad, it is not as practical as having one at a glance on the television screen. It also makes playing with a Pro Controller more difficult. Checking whether and who is fast approaching is now not as easy unless you pause the game, lift the pad up and try to retain concentration or use the rear view mirror, which may only give you a brief snapshot of what is going on behind. This pales in usefulness to a full map which shows you the precise location of everyone (including those ahead) in an instant.

- No quick way to compare vehicles and parts: There should be a compare button that allows you to select one vehicle/part and track the bars of others against it. The only practical way to compare is looking up an online table.

- Online track voting: no longer can you select any of the tracks. You are given a selection of four tracks, or can simply opt for any random course. This is a step backwards.

- Awful battle mode: I am alarmed at how bad this is. There are no arenas - you just race around (a select few of) the normal tracks firing at each other. This is so bad that it makes you wonder whether the game was rushed.

- No horizontal two-player split screen: the only available mode is vertical. This makes it very difficult to see around sharp corners in advance, and caters for the few times that the camera deviates slightly on the diagonal. Give players the option at least.

- Character selection: too many babies and repeats. You can play as three types of Mario and Peach. The Koopalings are a nice addition but at the expense of great characters like Diddy Kong. Why is ""Pink Gold Peach"" more iconic than Diddy, Dixie or King Boo?

- ""View replay"" is default selection after race: by default, ""next race"" should be selected, not view replay. This gets frustrating when you just want to get to the next race but through 20 years of habit press A only to be presented with the replay screen.

- AI: unfortunately the AI seems to cheat quite a lot. Thankfully, now that online is the centrepiece, this does not matter so much. You can really tell the difference in challenge when you play against the AI and then online. The AI has faultless accuracy for items like green shells and the boomerang, and seems to get the perfect item to ruin your race at just the right time. Expect bloopers on the last section of Grumble Volcano and blue shells in the last 20 seconds of a race when you are winning (this usually happens at least once every grand prix).

- Weapon distribution: Weapons from 1st to 6th place are invariably on the weak side. Mushrooms, coins and single bananas/shells are very common. Things only get interesting in the lower half of the pack, unless you race on frantic mode. In past MK games, 3rd place and below usually netted you something more powerful, such as triple red shells. However, even at the back of the pack, it is still entirely possible to get weak items, whilst those in the middle get high powered ones. This is very bizarre.

-Effect of coins: I think the return of coins is a great idea, but they are so important that driving skill is less important than whether you have 10 coins or not. The problem is that when you get hit or fall off, you lose three coins. This means that people in the middle of the pack are less likely to ever catch up with first place because they are constantly battling it out between each other and slowing each other down. In my experience, most races have one person far out in front and an explosive pack of people in 3rd - 10th that is anyone's game.

- Retro track selection. Personally I think there are too many tracks from the handheld games, although all of them are done well. However, I think Toad's Turnpike should NOT have included anti gravity elements, because this means that the main focus of the track - bustling amongst the traffic - is lost.

This may seem like a lot of criticism, but overall it still means that MK8 is a great game. All the tracks are enjoyable to play (although I don't think any of them are spectacular), the music is great and the racing itself is very smooth. The way the blue shell works (back to N64 days) is very welcome. No doubt I will be playing it for many years to come, hopefully with patches.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
emwick81,27-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 would have been much more enjoyable had it allowed arenas for battle mode. I long for the battle mode days of the SNES. It is nearly impossible to track down one's opponents in the race track battle mode environment of Mario Kart 8. Nintendo, please correct this!! Otherwise, this will be the last Mario Kart that I buy. Thanks for your consideration.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Celever,08-06-2014,"In a game series such as Mario Kart, breaking the bar and delivering a truly fantastic addition to the series is far more difficult than one would first think. Mario Kart 8 is overall a great game and is a lot of fun to play, however there are several design choices which I highly disagree with. The most noticeable is, of course, there being no map on your television screen. Looking down to your gamepad for a map is also very detrimental to your race, and having to do so will hinder more than help. This was especially noticeable in battle mode, where a map is more necessary than ever as you try to navigate full-sized tracks in order to find another player.
Another less noticeable design choice was that after a race in a Grand Prix or Versus race cup, you cannot merely mash the ""A"" or ""2"" button to move on to the next course. This is because they placed ""View Highlight Reel"" above ""Next Race"" or ""View Results"" in the menu, which has made me have to view the replays unnecessarily. Especially because, let's be honest here, very few people view replays of their races. This leads on to another complaint I have; it feels as if the development team hasn't tried to refine the game properly, and spent their time on unnecessary features such as Mario Kart TV, which is essentially a primeval version of the ""Mario Kart Channel"" we saw back in 2007 for Mario Kart Wii. A couple of noticeable cases of not refining the game properly is the lack of a stopwatch, and having the scores added or subtracted to your ratings disappearing after a short amount of time.
The game is also unfortunately easy. The whole point of Mario Kart is to be hectic, exciting and a fun multi-player experience. This game seems to be more like a generic racing game the likes you would find on other consoles. The Special Cup had me falling off of it a total of 2 times my first time playing this game (which was 150cc) when I truly didn't know the tracks. Both ""Rainbow Road"" tracks have too many walls for a finale, and other, actually quite hectic tracks such as Cloudtop Cruise or even the very first Mario Kart Stadium are pretty much lined with walls the whole way through. However, one of those examples is from the Mushroom Cup and the other from the Special Cup. This game has no difficulty curve! This is especially apparent when DK Jungle, from Mario Kart 7's Special Cup, appears in the Banana Cup of all things. Arguably the hardest new track in the game, Mount Wario, is in the Star Cup, not the Special... I could go on.
However, one must give credit where credit is due. It is likely that all of the retro tracks have had to have been made from scratch, as many redesigned parts have been placed in the tracks, along with all textures now being HD. Unfortunately, I prefer the retro tracks to the new tracks almost unanimously, but there are a few new courses which I think are going to be all-time favourites for me, such as Cloud Top Cruise. The Anti-Gravity is an incredibly fun feature, and it seems quite chaotic whilst driving through them in a pack. However, there are times where it seems quite tacked on (such as in Wario Stadium). In a franchise like Mario Kart, you have such high expectations to have to try and live up to it is no wonder this game isn't quite as good as others in the series. However, this is the worst game in the franchise, but it is still quite close.
However, this doesn't stop it being an incredibly fun game, and while it doesn't appeal to me, I'm sure it appeals to many other players. It looks gorgeous, as has been stated repeatedly over the Internet, but graphics alone don't make a game. Not once have I had a sudden urge to play Mario Kart 8 since buying the game. However, this is because the game doesn't appeal to me because what I see in a Mario Kart game is a short burst of fun-filled adrenaline with items and constant shifting of the places. What I see in Mario Kart 8 is a serious racing game the likes of the Dirt series featured on other consoles.

In short, if you want a serious racing game, I would buy Dirt 3 and an Xbox 360 over the far more expensive Mario Kart 8 and Wii U. If you want a fun and hectic Mario Kart game, a Nintendo GameCube (or Wii!) and Mario Kart: Double Dash!! would be the better option for you, along with Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart Wii in that order. If you already have a Wii U, then Mario Kart 8 is a very worthwhile game to pick up in the shallow game library the system has.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Aayph,03-06-2014,"I'm a bit disappointed by most of the reviews here, especially the 10 point reviews.
Many praising for the good old Mario Kart in HD, the sales bringer for the Wii U.
As hardcore Nintendo / Mario fan it seems you are not allowed anymore to note something negative, otherwise you might be a hater...

But let us face it straight - As Hardcore Mario Kart gamer it's letting me down.
Of course the game has many good points and it's still an excellent game, but if you played Double Dash, or the Wii version and you played it really hardcore you will find many difference in the Balancing of the game which will annoy you.

Lets start with the positive:
-> Best Graphics in a Mario Kart game so far
-> New Type of Vehicle, Quads
-> You can build your vehicle as you like (comp. to Wii)
-> Wonderful track design

Points that are neutral, mostly depends on personal taste:
-> New Items - There are good and bad additions
-> Character Selection - Some nice characters have removed, some have been added
-> Wheelies have been removed (comp. to Wii)
-> Item rates depending on place have been greatly change, less different items for first places etc.
-> Redesign of old tracks (+because it's not just a copy, -because they have become less interesting)

Negative things:
-> You can now only hold 1 items, removes strategy aspect from the game
-> Tracks are easy to master, it requires not much skill anymore to drive good times
-> Game became more luck based because of the new balancing

For me the races do not feel that intense anymore as on the Wii, I've the feeling I've less control over what happens with me. It was always the case you could have a good or a bad phase, you could easily drop to the last place or with luck having a comeback and win the race from last place.
In Mario Kart 8 it seems more usual that you drop a lot places, then gain a lot places again etc. the field is more tight together, but this does not mean it makes more interesting, it makes it just more annoying.

In my opinion the game has become even more casual than it already was, so for people playing from time to time, families and Kids it's great. But for people who also wanted to drive for competition need to look for a new game.

Actually subjective I would give it rather 4-5 Points, but from objective view it's more 7 - 7,5 points.

I as Nintendo fan boy and Mario Lover hope the next game becomes more intense again, but Mario Kart has lost the status for me as 'must buy game'.

Jecht_342,03-06-2014,"The first thing you'll notice about this game is that it's beautiful. I've liked the look of past Mario Kart games, but this one is beyond compare. Even the remade maps from past systems look amazing. The second important thing about it is that they've made some new innovations, and they all work pretty well. Driving underwater and on walls and gliding are all fun mechanics that are similar enough to fit in, but different enough to make the game seem fresh.

Rikkaiser,11-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a step backwards for the Mario Kart franchise. It's getting a lot of positive attention, as you would expect a Mario Kart game to get. I think people are beginning to disregard any flaws that a Mario Kart game may have now because of a delusion that all of these games are perfect. If this is your first time picking up a Mario Kart game, I would recommend Mario Kart Wii over this game, if you already have a Wii or Wii U. So why don't I like Mario Kart 8? They changed things that didn't need to be changed. It felt like they took content out. They added things that didn't need to be added. And worst of all, it feels like it was lazy. I'll get the positive things out of the way now, because I'd like to put more emphasis on the negative aspects. The game is fun, as usual. The game is gorgeous, too. The graphics are very nice to look at, the music sounds pretty good. They added a Piranha Plant power-up, which I thought was a strong and good addition- it chomps every few seconds, giving you a small boost each time and grabbing/attacking anything on your screen (even the Blooper that sprays ink). They also added a Music Box power-up, which was an excellent addition because it sends out a shock wave around the user, flipping any nearby enemy drivers and destroying any incoming hostile projectiles (including the Blue Shell) or any bad things left on the road. It's a power-up that requires skill and timing, and there can never be enough of that. Online mode is pretty smooth, I've never lagged and I've never had any problems finding people or connecting. Bikes were also made more similar to karts, which, while it takes away some of the uniqueness of bikes, adds a bit more balance to the game. The game also lets you take on the Grand Prix with your friends, something that should have been added a long time ago. That's it for the good. Time for the bad. And there's a lot more of it. When I first started the game, the first thing I did was look up a list of specific prerequisites to unlock characters (sorry, I didn't feel like finding out for myself), and the characters themselves. When I found something to read, it told me that all the characters are unlocked in a random order. That's stupid. In Mario Kart Wii, there was the more difficult-to-get Dry Bowser, who seemed awesome. And you know how you unlock him? By getting a one star rating or higher on all the new 150cc cups. Not too difficult, but was definitely satisfying to complete that specific goal and have that character waiting for you as a reward. Dry Bowser is just my favorite example- there are plenty of other characters that were unlocked in many different unique and specific ways. Mario Kart 8, however, has the universal method of coming in 1st place in any cup, unlocking one character per gold trophy. So you can't just go for the characters you want by taking on specific challenges- you just play and hope the game gives you the character you want (if there are even any on MK8's roster). My experience works out perfectly for this review- the only character I wanted was the last one I unlocked. That was real nice. Oh, and yeah, I only cared about one- Rosalina. The rest of the roster was garbage. They used all 7 Koopaling bosses from the original Super Mario World. While I was amazed and happy at first, realizing that they put ALL SEVEN of them in the game ruined any kind of excitement and nostalgia I felt. That was a lazy choice. And in case there weren't enough babies, Baby Rosalina joined the fray! Because, you know, we need more of the same exact character. Metal Mario is kinda cool I guess. Lakitu is okay, I love Rosalina, and the heavy/metal versions of Mario and Peach were fine. But, in my opinion, the rest of the roster was lame and lazy. 2-player split screen was made worse. The screen is now divided with a vertical line instead of a horizontal one, making your vision of what you actually need to see worse. Battle Mode was butchered. This one was painful. Remember those fun, arena-like tracks where you could have balloon battles in a frenzy? They're gone. The new selection of courses to battle on are just a few of the actual racetracks from the game. This was one of the stupidest decisions they made. They added some power-ups that are horrible. There's a Coin as a power-up now. It gives you a barely noticeable speed boost and two coins. Useless. There's also a Boomerang, which is seemingly impossible to aim. The ""8"" is stupid too, because it consists of 7 mediocre power-ups and a Star. But you have hardly any control what order they're used in, so I just mash the button until I get the Star. If you hold a power-up behind/around you now, like a banana peel, it doesn't empty your item slot. This takes away strategy from the game. Finally, the new anti-gravity mechanic is practically unnoticeable. I'm sorry to end it so abruptly, and I had more to say, but I'm reaching the character limit. Mario Kart 8 is a disappointment to the franchise",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Hardycore,31-05-2014,"Having read some of the reviews, I can't understand why people rate this game so high. Of course everyone has their own opinion, but I'm not that fond of it.

Let's start with the good stuff.
The game looks gorgeous. That, coming from someone who doesn't care about the graphics much, that means a lot. The soundtrack is nice too. It is very fitting.

What this game is lacking, however, is skill to master it. It is a nice and very fun game for any casual gamer and even my friend who is really bad at games in general, liked it.

But that's just it. It's easy and simple. There isn't much to be good at.

I'm not saying it doesn't take skill at all. It matters where you drive and there are several ways to take shortcuts. There are also several ways to increase speed. However, most tricks, if not all, you'll learn your first day.

The courses have gotten somewhat easier, the AI worse and items aren't as devastating as they used to be (which is a good thing). Having played mainly mario kart double dash, I have to say it has gotten worse instead of better. In double dash, you had to push enemies around and picking characters actually mattered. Each character had their own unique item, and that was certainly a very strong point.

In mario kart 8, the characters don't matter besides the 3 (6) weight categories. They simply look different. There is a whole lot of characters to unlock and if they would have been different from one another, it certainly would have added more depth to the game. Sure, it's nice to play with your favorite character, but for someone who's less interested in the lay out and cares more about the gameplay, it isn't really worth unlocking them.

A nice addition to the game is the option to build your own carts/bikes. Each part has their own stats, which is nice, but to me, the stats don't seem to matter much. Different bikes/cars don't require a unique way of driving, besides the difference between bikes and cars. The parts also often have the same stats, making it also visuals, pretty much.

Cool about this game is that it has zero gravity. You can drive upside down and on the walls. I also like the flying parts. However, because of the way the camera always follows the car, you can't really see the difference between being upside down or not. The flying parts are cool, but what would have been really nice is if it was optional. Being able to turn your car into a kite at all times. It would allow all sorts of techniques to get past obstacles and would add much more depth.

Something else I don't really like about this game is the lack of options. There is no option screen whatsoever. No way to turn down the music or change the controls. Also, using any controller other than the gamepad is somewhat buggy. Whenever you lay down your controller for a while, you can't pick it up and keep on playing. Instead, it suddenly goes to the gamepad, forcing to use that instead.

The game is also rather short, because it's so easy. At 150 CC you finally get the feeling you have to do something, so you can finish the game the first day. Luckily you can play online, so the game becomes both more challenging and it extends the duration. It's just not something I enjoy, because it doesn't take much skill but a whole lot of luck.

Overall:
It's a very fun game. It's casual and relaxing and lots of fun with friends. But casual it is. It is in no way competitive. The game doesn't take much skill to master, but it is very dependent on items, meaning it is a very luck based game. In competitions, you try to avoid luck based factors as much as possible and in this game it can't be avoided, especially because the game doesn't have much else to offer.

The graphics are great and the music is good too. The game plays like a charm and everyone can jump right in, without needing a lot of practise. You can play with all controllers (from gamepad to nunchuks), so everyone can use whatever they want.

Overall I give this game a 6.5",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GridironCJ,12-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a fun game, but it fails to take the series anywhere it hasn't been before and suffers from Nintendo's laziness in a few areas. Let's start off with the good. There are plenty of courses and a decent roster of characters to choose from. Nintendo added a little more depth by being able to choose your vehicle type, tires, and air peripheral. The game is colorful and looks decent for a Nintendo game. Why am I saying decent a lot? I'm simply not very impressed overall with this game. The graphics, while decent for a Nintendo game, are still very lackluster. There are a lot of rough edges and the detail just isn't there. Then again, I have higher standards than the average gamer. Additionally, you can no longer carry more than one item at a time. This makes the game a little less strategic, which is unfortunate. The battle mode is probably the worst-executed part of the game. There aren't even specialized maps for battle. Nintendo literally took some of the race courses and made them battle courses. Online multiplayer is also very underwhelming, as you cannot fill and entire race with human opponents.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a fun, but lacking game. It would be nice to see Nintendo try a little harder next time and not take the easy way out in so many areas.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ozorxoron,09-06-2014,"This is an incredibly fun game don't get me wrong, if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over and over then this is the game for you, it's just it lacks any real content. Sure it has a lot of tracks, but 50% of those tracks are pulled from previous games, some of which are absolutely tedious and make me question who in their right mind decided to bring them back. The variety of characters is very poor, it's mainly an assortment of your usual Mario, Luigi and Peach and then the babified versions of those characters and even metal versions of Mario and Peach. The variety is sorely lacking with the characters, I have no idea why as there's a lot of characters to choose from in the Mario-verse.

My biggest problem with this game comes from the lack of things to do, sure racing is fun for a few hours against the AI, then you realise over a decade later they still haven't fixed the AI to target anyone but you, so that spoils racing against the AI. The multiplayer is fun, sure, when you're not being disconnected from races. Even then it's just a matter of time before this games goes from amazing fun to tedium as you're just playing the same maps with the same vehicle over and over with nothing really changing.

A fun game, but a lacking one.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

ynotownemall,01-06-2014,"I really wanted to love this game but as it is I only like it. It looks fantastic and has a good variety of tracks. The player roster leaves a little to be desired, there should be less babies and koopa kids and more of the other toons we all like (Samus).

But when push comes to shove this is just the same Mario Kart game (that some of us have been playing since the SNES) with pretty graphics.

This is still a good game and any Mario Kart fan should pick it up, but it could have been great, Nintendo were simply to scared to take any real chances with it.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
lordrichington,04-06-2014,"As far as value goes, given that we got a free game with it - this game is worth it.

This is only aimed at the veteran. Disregard and buy if you are new to MK.

I give this game 5/10 because for all its colourful splendour - it was still boring me, an hour in.

.. It just has really very little new to offer. Most of the additional things are cute but gimmicky stuff that will only be used if you're stuck in the later places, looking for something to boost you back into contention. I don't begrudge that, but I know how to play the game so I just barely see that - and really, the longer you play the game, the less interest you have in the items.

Sure, we get customisation of ""parts"" to karts - but at the end of the day, that just doesn't really have much impact.

Tracks look nice, but are fairly easy and you're effectively vying for first place, during your first lap (there are no real surprises). Drive well, slide round corners, rinse and repeat. We've been here before.

Who really cares whether we're underwater or hovering on jets? Either way, the aim is to slide around the corners with the EXACT SAME handling.

My point is, there is no further effective changes to game play and really quite frustratingly there are no battle tracks, which means you're really basically reduced to doing the same thing you were doing on the previous game.

It might sound like I'm trolling to give it 5/10, but it's the eighth game in this series and if you're a veteran, you can go buy a very lowly rated game and at least get an hour into it without being tired. I haven't played a single minute of mario kart in about 2 years, prior to playing this and it was instantly underwhelming.

It's still ok at the price and current offer, but it's certainly a very mediocre effort by Nintendo - who have in the past really innovated - and with the state of this console, I really expected more. Give us race modes, give us battle arenas, give us handicap options, something!

Even when you play at your best, especially in online races, you will frequently acquire coins from item boxes. Another flaw is the character roster; where is Diddy Kong and Dry Bones? Instead of giving us these original characters (and more), we get five babies, two palette swaps, and the seven minions for Bowser. This is the worst list of characters yet, and it would have been nice to play as different colors of Yoshi and Toad. Finally, the Battle Mode is complete garbage now; you only have eight battle courses, and they are all race tracks. I'm pretty sure you get the idea. As for the good, it's not enough to revive this ridiculous game. The visuals are indeed the best, the controls are smooth, the music is mostly fantastic, but the amount of courses should have increased from 32 to about 50. What about the gameplay? Well, it is extremely simple, and it didn't change a whole lot. I wish Mario Kart 8 was more like it's hand-held predecessor, but with more content to boot.

for offline its a mediocre 6/10
sorry but mediocre at best rather play the wii version more. the graphics and gameplay is amazing but you'll get frustrated at the addition of the stupid coin item. want bannana only mode well i guess the coin is a bannana now. want a franic powerful items game yet again the coin is a powerful item apparently same with bob-ombs only. the Ai in this is lame as soon as you realise you can pick the slowest car even on 150cc and destroy the ai. but again that and the coin ruin what could have been an amazing game. only thing worth getting it for is the time trial. as for online yeh its pretty fun up to about 5k points then the dice rolls will screw you over in 5th? heres a coin or in 5th heres 3 mushrooms while the person in front gets a bullet bill. items just seems messed up this game. battle arenas have gone and also small but noticable is podium finishes. i hope the next game is better than this. sorry but after many many bs unbalanced online matches the score is lowered. to a 2 from a 6 if you want online get sonic and sega all stars racing if you want a family experence get this. this is unbalanced to all hell and not even better than the wii version. the Ai is really bad in this also probably cause they dunno how to balance their game but for single player this is the worst mario kart game so far. get it preowned for the time trials thats all your gonna have fun with.",0,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
endn,31-07-2014,"Worst Mario Kart. I appreciate the updated graphics, but the core gameplay is broken. Items are no fun to use because tracks are often too wide and splits into two or more paths that racers are too far apart. Not to mention you rarely get fun item if you are top 3. Battle mode is completely ruined.

AI cheats too obviously. For example you can be #1 for 2 laps and everybody seems to catch up in the last lap. Unlockables are lackluster. Ugly kart design, either too serious or too childish looking. Very unspired. Too much focus on collecting coins. Too many bowser children.

The battles are a little different I like them but I miss the large area maps and bomb bomb battles. Hopefully they can add stuff in with updates in the future.

Pongdok,01-07-2014,"My wife and I were extremely excited for this game. We tried to find one of the bundles, but ended up buying the game separately. No big deal. We got home and started playing it. The come-down was pretty hard.

The good:
- Looks great
- Drives alright

The Bad:
- Boring character selection
- Unnecessary Kart customization (go play gran turismo, or whatever...)
- Tracks excessively wide and devoid of interesting features (Anti-G doesn't appear to actually do anything.)
- Can't pick up a second item while trailing the first or surrounded by the 3-shell shield
- Track maps are on the game pad, for some reason. (I know you have a directive to use the game pad as much as possible to make it feel relevant, but busting the game isn't the best approach. Nobody should be looking down at the controller while trying to play a driving game.)

The very, very, very bad...:
- R.I.P. Battle Mode (Some people may not care, but this was an enormous disappointment for me.)

o.O Look at all these 10/10 reviews from what I assume are Nintendo PR spammer accounts and people who have never played a proper Mario Kart game. (You have my eternal scorn and heartfelt pity, respectively.)

While I appreciate whatever effort has been put into this, the focus is dreadfully wrong. Graphics and attempts at innovation are fine, but if you get the feel wrong, the fun just drains away and I want to go play another game. Use a variety of play testers next time, (ideally from as many demographics as you can get) and listen to what your old, die-hard fans tell you prior to release day.

I would play Mario Kart (SNES), Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart Double Dash before this.

I feel like my key gripe is MK8's bafflingly idiotic iteration of battle mode. Balloon battles don't belong on the circuit tracks, and they certainly don't need a dozen computer-controlled characters driving around fouling everything up. If I wanted to fight computers, I'd go race. I feel like they were put in because of the lack of proper battle arenas. Even with a bunch of extra cannon(turtle shell?)-fodder racing around in circles the 'battle tracks' feel huge and empty. There is no complex strategy and no sense of exhilaration or anticipation as you might have experienced stalking each other around the Block Fort in MK 64. In MK8, you either chase an enemy or try to joust in the second or two between when you see him and when you pass each other. This new battle mode is unplayable garbage, not worthy of a top-tier Nintendo release. Seriously, whoever gave the O.K. for this needs to get out of the video game industry and go become an accountant or investment banker.

If there is no patch to address some of these issues, then this was my last Mario Kart game. I'd feel completely cheated if it hadn't come with a download code for Pikmin 3.

I am holding out hope that the new Smash Bros. won't be a dumpster fire like this drek. If that's rubbish, I'll probably just play the Project M mod for Brawl and retire Nintendo to nostalgia-town.

icedchoffee,05-06-2014,"this game needs soooo much fixing, dont get me wrong its a good game i completed all the cups already with atleast a 1 star rating but the items and karts are sooo dumb. first of all the kart parts have ""stats"" in which some have more speed than others and some may have more acceleration, but none of those stats come into effect. i play as morton (heavy) on the sport bike with azure roller tires and the bowser kite. the stats for that is (4.25 speed, 4.0 accel, 3.75 weight, 3.25 handling and 1.75 traction) that is a great balance of a high amount of speed and acceleration but noooooo in this game ive gotten passed by normally driving by mario, who is a medium player, with the Standard kart, standard tires and the super glider which has (3.75 speed, 2.5 accel, 3.75 weight, 3.25 handling and 3.75 traction) so nintendo is trying to go above and beyond with these features of customizable karts but you basically customize them for show since the stats dont apply to the game at all. Second, the items in this game suck, ive gotten a star in 2nd place, that really doesnt make any sense at all in my eyes, when you get hit by an item its almost like youre stunned for 15 seconds, ive been in first place slipped on a banana and was sent all the way back to 7th in a matter of seconds. in mario kart wii, which is the best mario kart, when you had a mushroom or a star it would give u a noticably big speed boost...... not in mario kart 8, there is probably a 2% speed boost tops when activating star power. mushrooms in this game barely add speed as well, ive had a golden mushroom before and was passed by a person getting a boost from drifting.......wtf is that crap. there really needs to be something changed with the items with how often you get a certain item, what places can and cant get certain items, faster and more powerful boosts with mushrooms or stars and even the bullet bill. the bullet bill is complete garbage in this game. if nintendo is going to implement kart stats they should at least make it balanced or just have the stats removed. in addition to that, the stats are completely unfair, heavy characters start off with a base stat of (4.75 speed which is already fast, 2.0 accel, 4.75 weight, 2.25 handling and 3.25 traction) with just a base stat of that is completely over powered. having a footrace on mario circuit with heavy against light, heavy would win because of the speed they have(light has a base stat of 2.25 speed). overalll this game is completely 100% broken from items to stats to stun from items.right now with my experience on this game i would give it a 2.5 out of 5 and im a great Nintendo fan, but they really messed up this game and its bad.",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SuperAttackGame,04-06-2014,"This is, without a doubt, the biggest letdown in the Mario Kart series, a middle finger salute to the fans. Mario Kart 8 is a result of taking out everything that makes Mario Kart good, and leaves in the bad. Mario Kart 7 was pretty much the refined Mario Kart of the series, but that doesn't mean there was nothing to improve upon. They could have at least tried to make it on par with 7, but instead it was like they deliberately held back on this one. Were they trying to make sure there was enough to improve upon with Mario Kart 9? Because you don't do that. You don't try and make a sequel less than perfect so you can make the next sequel better. That's just a blatant, lazy excuse for money. To be a little more specific on why this game is bad - remember Mario Kart Wii, with its sloppy controls and rubber band AI? It's back in 8, maybe even worse this time around. How can they take such a step backwards? The stage design is also incredibly flat and uninspired, ironic given the anti-gravity feature, and that in itself is not utilised at all because I barely felt like I was going anit-gravity, and the stages are still flat.

It's very upsetting to see Mario Kart, of all franchises, become a lifeless shell of what it once was. 8 is the unlucky number for Mario spin-off sequels, it seems. This is the Mario Party 8 of the series, proof that people are getting sick of the series. Mario Kart will no longer be the big party game hit it once was, because even the biggest Mario Kart fans will have little good to say about this slump in the series. If we're very lucky, by Mario Kart 9 they will realise what they did wrong with this one and win everyone back - but let's face it, that's not very likely. Go away, Mario Kart.

LBC,31-05-2014,"A fantastic game that deserves every one of its accolades! I do have a few gripes though. I can't understand why Nintendo still insists on making retro courses. There are only 32 courses in the game, and half of them are regurgitated from old games. Why not have 24 new courses and 8 retro courses? Yes, they've been updated and retrofitted with all the latest features, but there's still an inescapable sense of deja vu. I'm also baffled by all the ""baby"" characters, but I guess Mario Kart is the most logical series to feature them.

Battle mode has been thoroughly re-worked, with disappointing results. Its more of an afterthought, really. I can't imagine you and your friends will spend too much time here.

There are some nice balancing touches in MK8. You can now block the infamous blue shell with a new item. To balance this, Nintendo has taken away the ability to pick up a new item while holding one behind you (banana, shell, etc). You can also boost off of other players (or give them a boost) while using anti gravity. Its a neat little game mechanic that adds a risk / reward factor to the racing.

Mario Kart 8 is an awesome game! However, as I've noted before, the Wii U library is still a barren wasteland when compared to PS4 and XB1. Don't rush out and buy a Wii U just for this game. You'll be sorely disappointed with your options once your through with Mario Kart 8.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
WildFire15,31-05-2014,"Mario Kart remains the prime example of what Nintendo is capable of. To some, that means rehashing the same franchise (and usually fail to acknowledge Call of Dutys and Assassin's Creeds are far worse if you consider rehashes to be lots of sequels), but for Nintendo it means adding new mechanics and tweaking existing ones to perfection.
Courses are well designed, items are better balanced (even better so as you can't hoard a spare, not to mention the Blue Shell finally has a proper counter) and the general handling is perfect. Graphical and audio wise, it's a step ahead of even next-gen offerings, reminding once again that pure graphical horse power does not instantly make a game visual superior. Online is also well developed and smooth, though it would be nice if, when choosing tracks in random games you could choose from all of them rather then 3 randomly picked ones and a random option.
MKTV's a neat additional feature as well, allowing you to upload automatically generated highlight reels of your races. There's little manual control beyond who gets focused on and what sort of content/length you want, but it's still a cool item to have.
There are aspects that aren't perfect, of course. If you don't like Mario Kart then 8 isn't going to change your mind, the lack of actual battle arenas is disappointing and for some reason playable Miis all where helmets (so they may as well be anyone), but if you've been sat on the fence about the Wii U, now's the perfect time to get one for this game.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

X-fushion,12-09-2014,"This game is overrated within the context of it own series, While Mario Kart 8 is a solid, fun and well designed (for the most part) it has some issues that put it away from ""perfection"". In the core Mario Kart 8 is great, the tracks are well designed and every single one has an unique charm, both visually and technically also you don't feel that the tracks are the same all of them had ""personality"", their own gimmicks and obstacles making them fun and challenging to play. Other welcome addition new vehicle customization the game, is kind of basic but works well, it suits your play style better and the vehicle classes (Kart ,bike, sport bike and ATV) bring balance to the game and more variety some vehicles like karts are better in straight line tracks while others like the sport bikes do better in sharp curves tracks, picking your vehicle is no longer a ""it looks cool"" fact it's about what vehicle suits you best and it brings more depth in the game. Also Drifting and mini turbo are nearly mandatory in the game, there's no longer an automatic or manual option, fortunately performing a drifting is vey easy unlike Mario kart wii and more responsive, master it to perform the super mini turbo requires a little practice but nothing hard or out of place, while it's possible to play the game without drifting is a game breaker if you decide to not, since all the CPU by default do it, and most of the players also do it because is to simple to execute, so don’t be surprised if you lose most of the time because you are not drifting. So at this point it sounds that Mario Kart 8 is a game that involves pure skill, well yes but also involves luck in the form of items the series had since the beginning you know throwing shells at opponents, using mushrooms to boost, that kind of stuff, unfortunately the very items is the downfall of Mario Kart 8, making it a game more about luck than skill. It's true that in Mario Kart luck comes to place but in past MK games skill was a more important factor sure you can be in 10th place and get cool items like the golden mushroom and bullet bills, but no matter how good the items were they meant little if the guy at 1st place was good at driving, and Mario kart 8 is the complete opposite for the most part, is more about the items you get than how good you are at driving. Let me go more in depth in Past Mario Kart Games, Like Mario Kart Wii for instance there was always called ""item priority"" this means that the lower you are in the place list you'll get better offensive items like a star, 3 red shells, a lighting, etc. and the higher you were you'll get basic offensive items and more defensive items, like a single red shell, bananas, green shells etc. So it worked well giving the guy in 12th place an edge to pass the opponents while giving the guy in fist place basic items to ""shield"" him/herself from the rest. In Mario Kart 8 that is no more, Item priority now is random, except from the guy in first place, so now you van get stars in 3rd place, triple red shells in second, lightning in fourth and even a bullet bill in fifth place, but in 1st place is more common to get the new coin item that a defensive item like a green shell, the coins in the game act like a boost you can collect them in the track or by getting one at the item box, collect 10 of them and you'll gain a little speed boost, the problem is that collecting 10 coins is way to easy and most of the time in 1st place you'll stock up real quick, not to mention that the coin item still appears even if you are max out, this means that the game somehow has the 1st place items prioritized by making coins more common that actual items, so this means that if you manage to get to 1st place there's barley any way to defend yourself from items. So that just throw over the window the whole skill add-ons like customization and drifting, sure there's some skill involved but now the guy that gets the better items wins this is way more notorious if you play online. So follow my strategy, don't ever try to be on first place the whole race always try to be in 3rd or lower that way you'll get all the cool items while the lead player can barely do anything to protect him/herself and when the final lap comes then try to lead the race at the half of the track, is more likely that you'll win this way than by trying to speed up all the time. Also there's no battle mode, well it is but is way to broken, the battles are without a radar in the main tracks, so yeah no battle arenas just tracks, is very uncomfortable to play, you'll spend 99% of the time trying to look for the other players and is just not fun at all. Mario Kart 8 still of its flaws still a good, fun game and you can have a great time with it, but is way to far to be the best Mario kart game.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

funkamonkey,04-06-2014,"After selling my Wii U last year due to the lack of games, I always knew I would return for some Mario Kart action. This has been my favourite franchise and has always been a great series to play with friends.

Mario Kart 8 is no different. It's brings fun back to your living room and with the solid, and free, online features, MK8 is the perfect progression of the series.

The first thing that hits you is the HD graphics. From the load screen and replays to the reflections on the players helmets, Nintendo have gone all out to impress this time round.

The gameplay is amazing fun and even better online. The customisations, although a tad limited, are a great addition to the home console version and the tracks are designed with love and attention.

It's not perfect by any means. The reason it doesn't get a ten is because the single player seems to be a lot easier than previous games and the battle mode has been ruined but this game is all about multiplayer racing, both local and online.

Get some mates together or fire up the online mode and this is where MK8 excels.

PanthersFanStev,31-05-2014,"Beautiful, shiny, fast racing game is a good description. Awesome courses and very fun online play. Don't hate me here, but I cannot help but compare to MK Wii which was better IMO. Why was MK Wii better? Character roster, tracks and challenge to unlock karts and characters. At current pace I will have everything unlocked in a week, it took 2+ months of play on MK Wii which made it more fulfilling to me. Hoping there are some additional characters to unlock, I am a fan of Dry Bones Bowser, Funky Kong and others that were dropped for Koopalings. That said, this is a MUST BUY Wii U game that you would be crazy to pass up, especially with the free game offer.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ransonshan,27-06-2014,"Being the 8th installment of a beloved franchise, I expected this game to do great. I was wrong, it did not do fantastic for my standards, IT SURPASSED ALL OF MY STANDARDS! This game was the reason I bought a Wii U like most people did and I don't regret one penny I spent on this title. The graphics are superb, one of the best looking Wii U titles on earth. You can see every detail on every character and kart in the game as well as the wonderfully creative courses new to the series. The sound is a mix of classic, adrenaline-pumping, calm, jazzy, psychedelic, and fun soundtracks to go along with updated remixes of old stages. Playing split screen, once again, is a blast with friends and strangers alike. Being an Assassin's Creed multiplayer fan only, i had little expectation for this game's online multiplayer. How wrong I was, this is one of if not the most addicting multiplayer I have ever being happy to be apart of in the digital age of gaming. The lag is noticeably absent for the most part and never had i felt so comfortable playing with other players online thanks to this game's beginner-friendly community. If anytime you come across i player or players so far out of your league, there is nothing preventing you from limiting your options to lower level players in the new custom menu to get used to the game's controls and stages. The single player mode in this title has been flushed out more than any other game in the series thus far, making the 150cc AI much harder this time around for added competition as well as the new highlight system to give your single player experience better purpose than just to waste time. This game features an all-star cast of unforgettable Mario characters as well as lesser-known characters. Kart customization is back from Mario Kart Wii and I am glad to say that the kart customization is much more expansive and offers a large variety of control setups depending on your character, wheels, and glider. The anti-gravity featured in most stages gives off such a vibe that was absent from previous games, making the stages feel grand and epic simultaneously with its large array of gimmicks and visual spectacles. So after all of that you may think this is the absolute perfect Mario Kart ever made, I wish I could say that. The main beef many people have with this game (and many reasons there are more negative than mixed scores) is the lack of classic battle mode. By that I mean it ditched the arena concept of the original games and instead opted for the players to race ON THE RACE TRACKS to battle one another. I appreciate trying something new but this was not the way to go, this mode can drag on and most of the time players barely make contact with other racers. Fix this mode and all that remain are very minor nitpicks, like the meta-game first place player being safer in this game than ever before compared to 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place players fearing for their lives. Overall, a phenomenal game with all the reason in the world to buy a Wii U.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Namloc,10-07-2014,"It’s really good, but its not a 10, Heres some reasons why.

The controls defaults to motion control so wiimote players have to constantly pause the game at the start of races to change the controls. On top of that, there aren't any options including no option to customize the button layout.

At the end of the race, “Next race” isn’t the default option, (View highlights is)

Weak character lineup (40% babies and kids)

Poor online features - No leagues/brackets for online racing, (you start at 1000 points, win = + Loss = -, but you have no idea where you sit in your region/global, aka perhaps you’re on 1484 points but are still 6000 behind 90th place? Who know’s) I’d like to know what bracket I’m in, e.g. a silver bracket racer aiming for gold etc.

No proper battle mode maps, seriously they couldn't really be worse, common complaint and it’s utterly bizarre they went with the normal tracks, it simply doesn't work well.

As I said before, there’s No Options e.g. adjust volume, screen brightness, control options, game settings like lap count, Option to choose to split screen horizontally as opposed to the default vertical split, there’s nothing…

No pressure sensitive acceleration which would be nice, pressing A seems dated, it’s not the end of the world but trigger accelerators are better.

No track editor which would add so much vaule. Allowing the community to expand on the track list would add so much value to the game and its future. They could introduce something similar to counter strike GO where community developed maps become official map packs for a price, in which the community developers are credited a percentage of the earnings for their awesome work. There’s a lot of ways they could benefit from allowing the community to develop maps. It’s a real shame.

Introduce an online compeditive team scene.
4 vs 4 vs 4 team modes to better include competitive play online, using the usually 15-1 point system, tally the points at the end of 4+ races and see which team won. Would also be nice for battle mode (but you’d still need proper battle mode maps) Top all this off with nice team rankings so you have an exact idea where your team is placed in regional/global standings.

Custom paint designs for karts, Let me pick and choose which color scheme I want thank you very much.

Time to change the franchise name to Nintendo Kart? So we can have characters from the other franchises too. It sounds like it’s going to happen anyway with amiboo toys so perhaps for MK9?

It's still a great game, but it's not a 10. I think anyone who plays PC games online will feel as though Nintendo is still lagging behind badly at this stage. No known development road map or patches to look forward to, what you see is what you get which seems behind the current times.
Still... I recommend the game if you have a Wii U but don't buy a console exclusively to play it.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ericiidx,31-05-2014,"So far, an incredible refresher on the pretty familiar Mario Kart formula. For the first time ever, kart handling finally feels like an organic thing! The graphics are just right, the artistic design is out of this world, and the environments are exploding with detail and personality. There's some pretty nice item balancing going on, especially since things can get nasty with 12 players. I've played every Mario Kart game (most of them thoroughly,) and this is shaping up to be the best one yet.

My only complaints are negligible ones; for example, you are given the names of selectable tracks in a multiplayer session, but the names are removed when the random selection takes place. The new anti-grav element feels more like a gimmick than anything else, but it does subtly provide shortcut opportunities and more eye candy, without taking anything away from the core experience.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Game got beautiful graphics, nice music, awesome tracks, and smooth online play (played quite a lot online, and haven't experienced any lag at all yet). In my opinion, this is the best mario kart game ever made. Items seems more balanced before (now its more about skill than luck), and there is finally a counter to the blue shell. Only thing i find disappointing is that they included unnecesarily many baby characters, and like gold peach for example.. Wth is that? Id much rather see diddy kong, boo, or how about cranky kong? Now that would be great. Apart from characters the game seems perfect to me. Don't get me wrong, some of the koopalings (new characters) are cool, but like i've said there are too many baby characters. Id swap baby daisy for diddy kong any day.

That title goes to ""Mario Kart 8,"" an absolutely gorgeous, rip-roaring, fun-filled, exciting time on the Wii U. On top of being gorgeous and fun, the music is brilliant and the online is actually pretty excellent, even on a console like the Wii U that has an awful online infrastructure.
Sure, the roster may have a few too many unnecessary additions, and the Battle Mode may not be as exciting as the previous adventures, but at the very end of the day, ""Mario Kart 8"" is the one Wii U game that you absolutely must own.

rushiosan,29-10-2014,"A 10/10 game if you look back at what the franchise achieved since 1990's, but a 6/10 in a matter of gameplay.

Mario Kart 8 suffers from major problems of item balancing and the gap between skill / luck that spoiled previous entries, but this time things got even worse. To put in simple words, it punishes good players. It's not a goot thing to stay in first, second or third places because your item sorting was greatly nerfed to either coins (absolutely useless) and bananas all the time. Forget green or red shells if you're 1st to 3rd place. The game is meant to punish good players even at vs CPU races, which's absolutely atrocious and frustrating. Why is there content to unlock by winning single-player cups then? This setting works perfectly for multiplayer parties because it gives everyone in the room a chance to win against a good player, but throwing that at CPU matches is absolutely non-sense.

I put this game down after finishing all mirror cups and I rarely play now. Videogames are meant to be enjoyed, not to frustrate you. Leave the ""luck"" aspect to board games and stuff.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Krobolt,02-06-2014,"There’s no denying that the Wii U has suffered a dry library of games for the last few months.
With the release of Mario Kart 8, Wii U owners have a new reason to return to their Gamepads. Mario Kart 8 is filled with the traditional upgrades: new weapons, new tracks, new mechanics, and new characters. All of these elements are fantastic as ever, but it’s the game’s attractive visuals and endless entertaining replay value makes it one of the best the series has to offer.

The newest mechanic introduced in Mario Kart 8 is its anti-gravity gameplay. Many walls and roads feature blue lines that will shift your tires sideways and magnetize your vehicle against the track. Gravity transitions are seamless and offer shortcuts even boosts to help anyone lagging behind. Colliding with other drivers on anti-gravity sections gives racers a boost allowing racers to take advantage of the completion in new ways. Gravity sections also include rotating pegs that racers can drive into to gain speed. These features can allow a racer to come from behind and take advantage of their surroundings to gain the upper hand.

Amongst the new features, includes new weapons as well. A new boombox item known as the “Super Horn” amides shockwaves that knocks out racers and can even destroy items including the infamous blue shell. Another new item is a piranha plant, which is a multipurpose item. When active, it chomps at anything in front of the racer, including opposing racers and obstacles. If there isn’t anything to hit, the piranha chomps at the air and offers the racer speed bursts. The boomerang flower allows the racer to throw a boomerang up to three times, with a chance to hit as it travels forward and back. Finally, the “Lucky Seven” item makes a return in the form of the “Crazy Eight” as eight items rotate around the racer giving the racer multiple options to devastate the competition.

Upon hitting the track, there’s no way to ignore the gorgeous visuals Mario Kart 8 has to offer. Its vivid colors and bloom bring the tracks to life and easily makes this game one of the best looking on the Wii U, even surpassing Super Mario 3D World. Many of the first races I shared with friends left them in awe as they stopped to notice the beautiful environments.

Each course in Mario Kart 8 is finely tuned, with tracks such as Toad Harbor, Mount Wario, Electrodome, and Sunshine Airport standing out as personal favorites of mine. Maro Kart 8 also houses the best versions of Mario Circuit, featuring a Mobius Strip style course, and Bowser’s Castle, which features a gigantic statue of the villain punching ripples into the track. Course design shines even brighter in their retro tracks. Royal Raceway is beaming with life and color and the inclusion of Rainbow Road from the Nintendo 64 redone as a beautiful grand finale is astonishing.

The cast of characters is as strong as ever, with 30 drivers to choose from. There are several new characters that make their first appearance as playable drivers, including the Koopalings from Super Mario Bros 3. Characters are unlocked at random after completing cups, unlike previous Mario Kart games. Although the cast of characters is welcome, it is bulked with Baby characters as well as the many Koopalings leaving out the chance for a more diverse selection such as Boo, Bowser Jr, even R.O.B.

Vehicle customization returns once again in Mario Kart 8. After choosing a driver, you put together your Kart, choosing a body, wheels, and glider individually to create your ideal ride. Whether its speed, handling, or even style, there is a wide variety of parts to choose from, with more to be unlocked as you collect more coins. You are not only limited to karts this time; Bikes return from Mario Kart Wii as well as ATVs which make their debut in this game. Each vehicle is fun to drive. Even after hours of playing with one vehicle, I still found myself toying with the customization finding new satisfying combinations.

As with each entry to proceed, Mario Kart 8 shines most within its multiplayer modes. With multiple controller options, it’s easy to set up races with multiple friends. For the first time, up to four players can participate in grand prix tourneys. Competing against your friends as well as eight CPU racers is as fun as ever. Along with Grand Prix, one to four players can also compete in versus mode, which feature completely customizable rules (bikes only, no items, etc.). Playing single player or with one friend runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, but adding more players makes a noticeable frame difference. It may appear slower, but nothing game breaking such lag. You can even take the action online, where you and another friend can set up games against friends and random players. One disappointing feature is its battle mode, which abandons unique arenas from previous games in favor of competing on standard race tracks.

Another new feature is its new Mario Kart TV system. At the end of each race, you’re given the option to watch a replay of your previous race. Each replay is fully customizable, from length to highlighted moments, such as drifts, actions, items, etc. It’s easy to edit, fast-forward and slo-mo each clip. You can even focus the camera on certain racers and watch their expressions as they jump ramps and slide past their competition. You cannot completely control the camera in this mode which seems like a missed opportunity. After you finish editing your clip, you can save it among your favorite with a star, or share it to the Miiverse and Youtube.

Most Mario Kart games stand out amongst others. Mario Kart 64 is a nostalgic classic to fans, and Double Dash shined with its unique gameplay mechanics. Mario Kart 8 deserves to be added to top-tier entries, with its rock-solid package that offers so much to all. Mario Kart 8 doesn’t change up the formula much, but it left me smiling the whole way through. Mario Kart 8 is the fast-paced, family-fun game that everyone should enjoy.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

guitarguy001,03-07-2014,"A great Mario Kart entry and my second favorite in the series. The soundtrack is amazing, the retro tracks feel fresh and new with the Mario Kart 8 physics, the new tracks are extremely well designed and the visuals are hands down the best on the Wii U so far; seriously, this game has visuals that i personally feel are on par with Killzone Shadow Fall & Ryse: Son of Rome for some of the best visuals on a console to date. The online is also very well done.

I also noticed that this is probably the fastest Mario Kart when it comes to pace. Lakitu is not slow as a snail as he was in the previous games and the new mechanics with the zero gravity enforce aggressive play as many of the physics have speed boosts.

As for negatives, the roster. The roster is horribly disappointing and uninspired, especially comparing it to Mario Kart Wii and Double Dash (especially the latter). Pink Gold Peach was a completely unnecessary addition and having ALL of the Koopalings as characters are waste of space imo, 3 would have been OK and it would have opened space for other characters like King Boo, Petey Piranha & Funky Kong.

The other negative, the battle mode. The battle mode is no longer arena based, it's now the race tracks and you go against the opponent there. No longer as strategic as the other battle modes especially now since you can no longer get another item when you are already holding another item, and not nearly as fun. Comparing this battle mode to N64's or even Double Dash's battle mode, they make it look like a complete joke.

Besides those two flaws, this game is incredibly fun. It improved Mario Kart in almost every single way with mechanics, soundtrack, track design and visuals (seriously they look amazing) but also makes the retro feel fresh and new.

Luigifan10,31-05-2014,"So, this game has been in development for a while and people say this is one of two games (The other one being Super Smash Bros for Wii U) that will sell the Wii U drastically. And if this game doesn't sell Wii U's, I don't know what will. For starters, this game is absolutely beautiful. The HD and details are insane! Luigi's mustache even blows in the wind! The new anti-gravity is really cool, even if it doesn't change up the core gameplay drastically, which is good. The new items are really cool and aren't over-powered or weak. Well, except for the Coin item. That's the item you'll get most of the time when you're in first, and all it does is add 2 coins to your coin count. The new tracks are some of the coolest ever, and the retro tracks are updated a lot. Except for Music Park. The only thing updated there was the graphics. The new Balloon Battle is a little weird because you're in race tracks instead of in arenas. This is fine, except that it may be hard to find others on occasion, because it's so big. The character selection is actually a little lame. The new Koopalings are pretty cool but another newcomer, being Pink Gold Peach, is a dumb Metal Mario clone. And, not to mention, there are 5 BABIES. 5. I think that's really stupid. The roster is also missing a lot of characters that could be better than others, such as Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, King Boo, etc. But if they add some DLC, then that problem could be fixed. The multiplayer is as fun as its ever been, but it might take a while for everyone to choose their kart combination. I wish there was a faster way to change your kart combo. The online is great, with little to no lag and fair rules for everyone. The reasons I didn't give it a 10/10 are that there are some unnecessary characters and the weird Balloon Battles. If you like Mariokart and don't have a Wii U, this would be a perfect time to get one with the Mariokart 8 Bundle! And if you have a Wii U already, the you need to get this game!

Scottview,05-06-2014,"Although there are a few unfortunate missteps in this new Mario Kart game, such as limited match customization options, Mario Kart TV not realizing its full potential, and a rather gimped battle mode, its not enough to take away how utterly fantastic the traditional racing mode is in this game. Every single new track is a winner; and although the new much touted anti gravity feature never truly gives the sensation that you are upside down or riding on a wall, it allows for track designs that twist and curve in the most interesting and thrilling of ways. There is never a dull moment in a courses design. Necessary tweaks to items and a decreased punishment for getting hit make the game much faster paced, fairer, and more skill based. Gone are the days of ending up in first place by accident. Sure a few fortunate item pickups can help, but you need to use them properly, and if you get to first, by jove you've earned it.

Also, not enough praise can be given to the games presentation. In my opinion, this is hands down the most beautiful game Nintendo has ever produced and the attention to detail is astonishing. The same has to be said for the soundtrack, which strikes the perfect balance between familiar and nostalgic tones with an energetic, jazzy, and more orchestrated sound that pairs perfectly with the frenetic on screen action.

So, in the end, despite a few head scratching and aggravating choices to modes most people won't care to much about, this is probably the purest Mario Kart you can find. The racing mode is the perfect culmination of more than two decades of Mario Kart games and it shows in all the ways that matter the most.

Raixima,01-06-2014,"By far the most beautiful game on Wii u, to be fair, the game wouldn't be displaced if it was running on the PS4 or XboxOne, it's that beautiful, but as beauty isn't everything the game also provides excelent gameplay, thank god they took off that dumb automatic drift and the AI in 150 cc is mercyless, if you don't own a Wii U, now is the time, but be prepared for some tough competition online!!
AMAZING GAME, the only thing I don't quite adore in the game is the battle mode, that is kind off messy at first and the fact that on multiplayer the gamepad mimics the screen, that meand, in 4X4 your gamepad will be diveded in four parts.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Toshione,01-06-2014,"The only reason someone wouldn't like Mario Kart 8 is if they just don't like kart racing video games. As with previous Mario Kart games there are 8 different cups to race as well as time trials, battle mode, and on line multiplayer. On line multiplayer works fast and is a real blast. There are lots of new characters to play as and plenty of different options when it comes to customizing your kart.I won't say its the best Mario Kart ever made, but it is definitely a reason to buy a Wii U.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
counterfifth,03-06-2014,"This game made me buy a Wii U! It's fair to say the Wii U had a rocky start but this is what Nintendo do best. You really don't need a machine with a tons of processing power and high end graphics cards to create a beautiful game. Let me tell you this game is stunning, it just looks gorgeous!!!

The tracks are beautifully crafted and the different cc settings really open up the game difficulty to everyone.

The score is up to Nintendo usual high standards and really adds another fantastic dimension to this game.

I honestly think Nintendo are one of the only developers that consistently produce high quality 'video games'. Now your thinking why the 9/10 and not the full glory of 10/10. Well it's the playable characters that let it down. From all of Nintendos Mario characters why go with all the Koopa kids, just a little dull and short sighted if you ask me. In addition the Mii characters look terrible. Saying that they looked terrible in the last one so...

I would recommend buying this game for the Wii U you'll have a blast. Get online and get racing!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

If you have been on the fence about getting a Wii U let me assure you that Mario Kart 8 is worth getting one for.

Hipster1989,30-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is simply a phenomenal Kart racer/ party game. It is highly competitive off line and online. 150 cc mode is the hardest that I have eve player. The online is well done to making it easy to start matches straight away with anyone around the world.

Mario Kart 8 is the best next gen game so far in my opinion. Forget Titanfall, forget Infamous Second Son. Mario Kart 8 is where it is at.

The only thing I dislike in this Mario Kart is the item selection but new ideas like Mario Kart Tv where you upload video highlights to youtube make up for that.

If you are looking for a fun and challenging single player experience Mario Kart 8 has length as 150cc mode is tough and collating all of the parts, vehicles and characters will take a couple of weeks. Once that is done just play with family and friends when people come over for parties and there is always Mario Kart Tv and the online modes to keep you playing Mario Kart 8 from years to come.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Not more, not less. When you own Nintendo consoles, than you own Mario Kart. That's a fact. And you get what you expect with this one. Better graphics new characters a new vehicle and new stages.
One Major letdown is the vs combat mode. They didnt build new Arenas, they just used the same ones.

1) The battle mode is tremendous better in wii; Seems like nintendo dedevelopers were lazy in this point;
2) The single player mode, to me, is just the same (means not deep);
3) I never tried the online play in wii one, but in the Mk8 the online mode is great. Mention: Missing features: Voice chat (or at least a text one).
4)The visual! One of the great improvement! No coments here more than ""I really love the MK8 visuals;

AVdE,26-08-2014,"Astonishing how beautiful Mario Kart looks in HD! The tracks are fabulous and the anti-gravity makes an exciting and awesome addition in terms of gameplay. Everything about this game is absolutely amazing, with a few exceptions:

The battle mode tracks from previous mario kart games are replaced with slightly modified tracks. This makes battle mode feel a lot like regular racing, so hopefully nintendo will fix this with DLC.

The weapon selection doesn't feel balanced. Sometimes, you get boosts in first place, or a green shell in 8th place or lower. And once you end up in the middle during online races, you get brutally smashed.

A minor flaw is that the gamepad screen displays the same split screen from the TV during local multiplayer, instead of only the own racer's screen.

Further, there are a couple of tiny drawbacks that are going to be fixed with an upcoming update, so they're not really worth mentioning.

Overall though, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game. It's plenty of fun, it looks gorgeous, it runs smoothly and it's a blast to play with friends.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Would you play it again?

Yes, i really enjoy playing this game but unfortunately the online isn’t that much fun and so to me this is a local player game.

The game play is still of great quality as past Mario Karts and fun like the others. The mode to customize your car is fine, but manipulate their characteristics, can have been omitted.

I would definitely missed more tracks and more variety of characters, I find no difference in using a 5 babies.

vahn,22-04-2015,"Before saying anything, I want to tell right away that this game is fun: there's a lot of stuff in it, a lot of characters, a lot of detail and I really enjoyed it a whole lot when I played it: the new features such as anti-gravity and the glide kind of makes it quite weird but also interesting, without ruining the flow, and a tiny bit of customization that definitely makes the game even more personal. In other words the game is fun, and it was the game that made me purchase the Wii-U.

AND MAN, what a boring-fest after a short while.

Before playing this game I spent at least 50+ hours in a very similar game, and more specifically Sonic All-stars racing transformed, and I had a huge amount of fun in that game for many reasons. But as soon as I went on this game, I finished almost all of the circuits, at 150cc (I can't get the 200c because I can't connect my Wii-U. Thank you for no Ethernet plug Nintendo!)), in a single day. Why? Because it's mindblowingly easy and simple! I finished all my tracks using ONE type of vehicle, ONE set of parts, and rarely lost any race and on top of that each race is incredibly short too, making each race last not even 5 minutes (or barely so).

I mean wow, I don't like to compare games nor to bash on such a famous series of kart games, but I expected much more from this game: aside the usual circuit there isn't much else to do, and while there are many characters to unlock I have only managed to unlock bowser's children and various toads. REALLY?! I don't care about Bowser's sons and toadette, give me the actual real characters of the games! But it doesn't really matter anyway: stats don't really change much if you change character, only the parts you put on your vehicle do and that's it. As far as I noticed, the character is just for visuals.

Sure, the game is a lot of fun to play in multiplayer...but frankly it's barely an excuse: I've played Mario Kart 64 back on the Nintendo...64, and it was way more enjoyable and cured than this game, even in single player. But this game I just got instantly bored as soon as I finished the circuits...oh and I forgot to mention how the AI is atrociously bad, but not in only one way: it's very common at high difficulties to lose a race because, suddenly, ALL of the racers will start throwing their skills at you. It seems like everyone hates the player to the point of not even letting you recover, and the funny part is that only one or two racers will actually reach first and win. throughout all 4 tracks, leaving the rest on the dust.

I suppose they just don't want me to win...I guess I'm even more disliked than Waluigi hm...

At any rate, this is a good game, an excellent racing game BUT with a lot of lackings in my opinion: the Circuits are short, the customization is nearly pointless, the many characters are almost a joke (I don't want mini bowsers or toads copies!!!!!!), and the game doesn't really feel fair in challenge.: on top of that I didn't see any interesting mode except for battle, which is downgraded in comparison to the previous games.

Overall, it's a good game, DEFINITELY not bad, but I can't deny that It made me want to play the Mario Kart 64 the more I played this one. Or Sonic Racing Transformed on the pc...

At least the sensation of speed there is done better....",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

danrenfroe2016,26-10-2014,"Summary

Best Entry in the Mario Kart Series. Even Beats my personal favorites Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart DS.

Presentation

Absolutely perfect, you are greeted with excellently crafted in game models of favorite Nintendo characters, super visuals and great menus and online capability.

Gameplay

AAA gameplay in both the single player player and multi-player modes. I will not go into much detail as other reviews have detailed this completely. The addition of the glider, propeller and hovercraft mechanic is great and feels so much like Mario Kart even though it is new to the series. the Level design is absolutely top notch except for I would have liked more shortcuts. Also the mushroom powerup has been de-rated way to much for my liking. The other outstanding accomplishment is that the realism has been kicked up several notches (Don't worry its still Mario kart physics). All the Karts and bikes now have working suspension and wonderful cartoon like animations. Never have I felt that Wario and all the other playable characters were more alive. Their distinct personalities and traits really poke me with joy as I race the different characters.

DLC: a welcome addition as they are adding different characters and Zelda for the first time is racing... And 16 additional tracks are incoming as well...

Disappointment: Battle arenas are gone?!? I really hope Nintendo adds them back in within a game update as this is not cool...

Graphics

Stunning... Stunning... Stunning. This showcases the Wii U capabilities with special effects, great multi-layered textures and stunning lighting. Its amazing the difference in areas like moo-moo farm when comparing the Wii U and the Wii version. Runs at a steady 60fps for single and two player, and 30fps for 3 or 4 player.

Sound

Great sound, good Jazz music and effects. However I am disappointed with the 6.1 mix again...

But the gameplay itself in MK8 is so ridiculously polished and amazing that for me, all of that was overshadowed. Sure, Nintendo didn't include as many bells and whistles in MK8 as in other titles, but as a game itself, it can't be faulted. Presentation and graphics are all top notch, and the music is absolutely stellar with its unique orchestration and various styles. There's also a lot of nuance to the courses with anti-gravity, air, and sea travel finally implemented on a console MK.

The free game offer from Nintendo sweetened the deal for me though, so I went ahead and bought it and I am so glad I did. It... is... AMAZING! It has some of the best, if not the best graphics in a Wii U game to date. The courses are cleverly designed and it features very addicting multiplayer and challenges. It even allows for voice chat with friends. (Although it would have been cool to have voice chat with all players.) The one thing I didn't like though, was the battle mode.

zaaKun,13-07-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a great game and definitely a reason to get the Wii U. But even though it's great, it also has its flaws.

One of the greatest for me is that you're really defenseless being in first position. Most of the time you will get some coins that are neither useful for defense nor offense.

Another one for me is the NPC behaviour. I've been obversing one thing: if a NPC gets first place in a race, he'll most likely also get first place in all the consecutive races IF YOU don't prevent it. This may be just coincidence, but I've played the game a lot in the last few days and that's what I noticed.

I really dislike the Battle-mode. It's just on normal tracks that go both ways. I only remember how the battle mode in Mario Kart 64 was, and it was really fun, not at all comparable with the one Mario Kart 8 brings.

ricklongo,14-07-2014,"Coming in at a time when the Wii U needs heavy-hitting powerhouses to turn its fortunes around, Mario Kart 8 is breath of fresh multiplayer air in the console's growing line of must-have titles. The ""killer app"" title would fit quite well here; it's not the absolute best game on the Wii U right now, but it's certainly the one with the largest widespread appeal.

As anyone can immediately tell, this is a game with great attention to detail. The pristine HD graphics are amazing, and they're made even better by the extensive replay options after each race. You can watch as characters full of personality laugh at each other, challenge each other, stare at each other in disdain. It's funny, it's quirky, and it's exactly the sort of thing that makes Nintendo games memorable.

The single-player mode is fun enough, but it lacks in secrets, cameos, ""wow"" moments, and the assorted mix of cool stuff that makes solo experiences memorable. It's nice both as an evergreen game for quick-burst sessions (something the Wii U lacked beforehand) and for getting the gist of controls in order to not embarrass yourself in the mode that is real reason this game is great: the multiplayer.

As anyone who ever played any Mario Kart before will attest, this is the ultimate local multiplayer experience right here. It's fun, it's chaotic, but it's also very nuanced and incredibly reliant on skill. It's the sort of game anyone can pick up and play, especially in lower difficulties, but it takes quite a while to master. Online multiplayer also impresses: it's the best it's ever been in any Nintendo game, with robust tournament options. The one letdown is battle mode, which takes place in actual tracks rather than custom-built arenas. Let's hope future downloadable content fixes this, as this is a mode that used to take quite a chunk of my gaming time in previous instalments.

As one of Nintendo's premier franchises, Mario Kart once again impresses and offers one of the most universal reasons yet to get a Wii U. The quality is definitely here, and the focus on multiplayer means it's a game that will likely last for the entire console generation, making it a very easy buy.

GoombaJMR,14-07-2015,"Nintendo strikes gold again with Mario Kart 8, making me roll back into the groove of the Mario Kart Franchise. In terms of hour-counts, I've put around 500+ on MKDS, 70 on MKWii, and 90 on MK7, and MK8 is quickly rolling to the 20 hour mark. I've felt that this game's just got so much polish everywhere. The gameplay itself in races is perfectly solid, and the item use is almost perfectly balanced. The coins are great, new items are alright, and the music is definitely pretty good. I have a small gripe on the battle mode, and am a bit disappointed that it hasn't returned to infinite-time battles seen in Mario Kart DS. It isn't too big of a problem though, and the positives instantly outweigh the negatives. The online components are okay, but really good in terms of Nintendo's online systems. I feel that Mario Kart 8 does a good job with everything, and the DLC is just worth the money with all that good stuff. The game isn't exactly that long, but the replay value is pretty good. Also, I am somewhat disappointed with the lack of variety for the character roster we have for this game. Baby counterparts for many characters, 7 whole slots (instead of repaints) for the koopa kids is somewhat of a waste (I believe), and other random counterparts like tanooki mario are a bit unnecessary. I would have liked to see the return of some characters, including Dry Bones, King Boo, or maybe some new characters like the Goomba. Either way, the game is solid - definitely worth all your money

Greenicey,14-07-2014,"There's not a lot to say that hasn't already been said. This is one of those rare games that I do feel deserve a 10/10. First off, while the gameplay is extremely similar to any other recent mario kart game, the balance has been completely reworked. It's still not perfect, but hardcore gamers are bound to enjoy this almost as much as a casual one. Battle mode has been changed so that you now battle on actual tracks, it's weird, confusing at first, but eventually I warmed up to it and may play it when I'm bored of racing. As virtually every other reviewer has stated this game is absolutely gorgeous. It definitely rivals anything the other systems have out there currently, the zoom in shots especially exemplify this. Nintendo has never really been one for graphically powerful systems or games, but they definitely should be it's that good. Will this game save the Wii U? Probably not, but it sure is the kick in the pants that it needs right now.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
HawkeyeWii,26-11-2014,Easily one of the best Mario Kart games and still one of the best games released from this new generation of consoles. It looks gorgeous and plays so smooth.

Carlsdil000,05-02-2015,"Mario Kart Wii U takes almost everything about Mario Kart Wii and makes it even better. The levels and detail are absolutely gorgeous. Mario Kart is finally in HD and it is breathtakingly beautiful. The level design can get a tad chaotic at times with karts zooming in many different directions and even upside down at times, but they are still a lot of fun to race on.
This time around you don't have to worry so much about constantly being hit with items like in Mario Kart Wii, as it appears that missile items such as shells and slippery bananas have been scaled back a little in favor of more ""helpful"" items such as mushrooms and coins.

Using a Wii U controller vs a Wii Remote takes a while to get used to. I feel like the Wii Remote is better suited for a game like this than a small tablet controller, but I eventually got used to it.

Overall it's a great Mario Kart experience, one that you should not miss out on!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
knifeandfork,27-10-2014,"Before the gravity mechanic of MK8 was revealed, I expected it to be just another Mario Kart game, with few actual new ideas. But I was proven wrong. In Mario Kart 8, Nintendo has created their best Mario Kart in years. There's an abundance of ideas in this new entry, which makes it a joy to play.

One of the most exciting things about MK8 is the fact we're finally getting a Mario Kart in HD. And it doesn't disappoint. The game looks amazing, constantly throwing in another welcome visual surprise. Mount Wario, for example, is a wondrous sight. The visuals in it are varied all the way through and you'll see a variety of views. What about Sunshine Airport? This intricately crafted track has you crossing a wide variety of terrain, with the visual spectacle of seeing a plane soar above you as you glide to the end of each lap. It's clear that there are a lot of points in the game which serve the purpose to simply amaze you visually again and again. With the fluid animations and crystal-clear graphics, it's impossible to complain about the visual side of things at all. What's more, the new anti-gravity mechanic makes it even more spectacular. You'll see things you never thought you's see in a Mario Kart game.

But what about the sound? Simply put, it's wonderful. Much of the music is recorded live, giving a much richer quality than in past Mario Kart games. All the various pieces are excellent, contributing to the polish of MK8.

However, the graphics and sound are merely an afterthought compared to MK8's revolutionary gameplay. Though gliders, kart customisation and all the rest of it return, the focus is on the brand-new mechanic that changes everything: anti-gravity. You can drive up walls, upside down, up a waterfall, and more. This new mechanic is used in many ways, and apart from the visusl thrill of driving upside down, it grants the gameplay a lot too. In Toad's Turnpike- which is actually a remake of the N64 version- you get the choice of driving on the walls the whole time, or staying on the road. This gives gameplay a whole new strategy. Also, when driving in anti-gravity, slamming into another racer doesn't slow you down, it instead gives you a speed boost. This means that now, even if you're playing as Mini Mario, you'll want to hit Bowser or DK to get that speed boost, completely overturning everything we knew about Mario Kart. Of course, MK8's other big innovation is Mario Kart TV- a feature that creates highlight reels of a race, with impressive camera angles, slow motion and the ability to edit the reel. You can then share these short videos on Miiverse and Youtube, a pleasant surprise from a tentative company when it comes to online. MKTV works well with anti-gravity because during gameplay, the camera still stays right behind you when you go upside down, meaning you still see it from the racer's perspective. However, MKTV shows the highlights from other camera angles, so you'll see your racer on their side or upside down- an impressive sight. On the whole, MKTV is an excelent addition which gives you the chance to share the best moments with friends.

As for the multiplayer in MK8, it's a lot of fun. It's disappointing that you still have to play split-screen in spite of the Gamepad, but multiplayer is so fun that's easily forgivable. Online is great, with the well thought out voting system making a return so that a variety of courses can be played. There's no voice chat during play, and I wish you could type messages yourself between races, but the online is nevertheless solid.

So far, I've been very positive about the game, though there are a few small complaints I have. The fact the Gamepad has the map is no longer a flaw since the update, so I can count that one out. However, the amount of characters you can play as is small. I appreciate the inclusion of the Koopalings, but overall the roster is underwhelming. And the less said about MK8's horrendous battle mode, the better. It was an enjoyable distraction from the main game in previous MK titles, but in this one, the battle stages have inexplicably been replaced by ordinary tracks, making it a mundane experience.

These are small flaws when compared to the quality of the majority of the game. MK8 is one of the best entries in the series, with some of the most innovative game design I've seen in years and an impressive feature enabling you to share highlight reeks of races. Despite a couple of odd slip-ups, it's an outstanding game overall.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MW1AA2Gs,14-07-2014,"Mario Kart to me at least is a series which with every new release they completely annihilate the last one and make it so that there's no reason to ever back track (the exception being super circuit) to a previous title and yet there are still a few things in the old games which keep them in most Nintendo fans libraries even when they're more then ten years old... And guess what they did it again. Mario Kart 8 does a lot of new things for the series like zero gravity (which by the way isn't disorienting and unbelievably smooth), the new crazy eight item (which can really help catch you up if you messed up and ended up in the back), the horn (which FINALLY ends the terror of the blue shell... most of the time), and tons of more cart customizations. In terms of presentation it is perfect... literally, the tracks look unbelievable and the music is beautiful on some tracks. The character roster is great with tons of new characters and old ones (but does feel a little lazy sometimes). Overall the game is unbelievably well made and reminds me why we should always expect good games from Nintendo.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

FogCityRoller,26-11-2015,"It's really, REALLY difficult saying this but...this might just be the best Mario Kart game ever made. I'm an '80s and '90s kid, so I actually grew up on the original on SNES. In fact, the very first time I stayed up all night was the Christmas my parents got us Mario Kart. It feels wrong to buck the original from the top of the rankings in favor of the most recent title but this is really a spectacular game. I'm not here to post my rankings where each Mario Kart title stands, but I just grinned like an idiot for hours while playing this one and the online play is pretty amazing.

To make it even better, the DLC for Mario Kart is probably a contender for the best DLC ever released for a game. I know the DLC has its own rating page, but the fact that it wasn't overpriced serves as another bonus point for the main title.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Soccerdude00,11-09-2014,"A throughly excellent addition to my now growing Wii U library, Mario Kart 8 is without a doubt a worthwhile purchase. The game uses the Wii U's graphics to great effect, creating wonderful settings for whipping around the course with your favorite Mario mascot. Retro courses are well designed. But the new courses are exciting as well. Battles are a disappointment, however. Instead of a small, compact, brand new/retro arena like Mario Kart Wii among others, you instead just race around the same courses you use for multiplayer and single player. This is the only reason why I didn't give this game a ten. Online mode is outstanding, with connection speeds that are fast and lag doesn't exist.

I find every time I race, I stay in 1st-3rd place, and then get hit by multiple items at the end that brings me down to 6th or lower. They tried to make up for this with the super horn being able to destroy blue shells, but you never get it in first place.

BROstoise,07-08-2014,"10/10 best Mario Kart. Stunning visuals, racetracks filled to the brim with creativity, and transformations from Mario Kart 7 have been perfected.

There were 2 complaints: the coin item, and the ability to only carry one item.
Several times, I found myself wishing for a coin, since the ones on the race track usually arent along the inner-most curve, also known as the fastest route.

Constantly holding down the left shoulder button to have 2 items gave me hand cramps. The pain is gone now because I can only hold one item anyway.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SableSoldi3r,12-10-2017,"Mario Kart 8 is everything you should come to expect from a next-gen Mario Kart title. The visuals are beautiful: graphics are very detailed, and courses are colorful and eye-catching. The gameplay is nothing new for Mario Kart, as it employs all of the mechanics from previous games while new additions are minimal, ranging from a few new power-ups to some new kart customizations. Making a return from Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 7 are coins, which add some variety to the game and allows for some ""fun along the way"" as you try to grab coins to cap out your max speed. The revamped courses are gorgeous and very nostalgic, and the remixed music was a blast from the past. My personal favorites are N64's Rainbow Road, SNES's Donut Plains 3 and Wii's Moo Moo Meadows.

One minor complaint I have about this game is the item balance, both in quality and quantity. First: one of the new items unleashes a piranha plant that frantically snaps its mouth, giving you speed boosts, nabbing nearby coins and knocking out opponents in the process. Although you only typically acquire the piranha plant when you're towards the bottom of the board, it seems a bit overpowered and does a lot for one power-up.

Second: just like in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 increases the number of concurrent racers from eight to twelve, which drastically increases the number of items on-screen. When I first picked the game up, I immediately jumped into 150cc Grand Prix. Being a veteran of the series, I've done this before with previous entries to challenge myself and was able to get accustomed fairly quickly. In just about every race this time around, I was in first place for more than half a race, ahead by a considerable distance, and then out of the blue I got hit with an assortment of three or four different shells that sets me back at least eight places and left me to finish the race in fourth at best. For a game that requires you to get first on all four races in a cup in order to get the best award for that cup, this is infuriating and incredibly frustrating. You can do everything right in a race (drifting, drafting, hitting speed boosts, doing tricks off every jump, collecting ten coins, etc.), only to be barraged with shells at the very last second and to be thrown into sixth place, forcing you to restart the entire cup and ultimately resulting in a waste of time. It feels like, no matter what you do, this game doesn't reward skill but simply gives you a slight chance of having a three-star rating fall into your lap, which honestly isn't fun in the slightest.

Items aside, this game is very fun to play with friends and it's a very refreshing Mario Kart experience. Just don't expect to have much fun if you're in it even remotely for the achievement.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

dinosauryoshi,10-08-2014,"The best Mario Kart since the N64 era. The end. Well actually that’s not the end, here’s the full review;

On the gameplay front this is the best Mario Kart yet. The physics feel deeper and the karts feel so fun and smooth to drive. The anti-gravity works really well and I love the addition of the spin boost especially. I also think the new weapons are great and add something new. I even like the coin item as it means the leader can’t always bank on getting something to hang off their backside and protect them as they zoom to victory, I do however wish it appeared a little less frequently. Now only being able to hold one item at a time was also a good move in my opinion for similar reasons, the leader can’t have two protective items at once and is always at least a little vulnerable.

Visually it looks good enough to eat (particularly the candy track). This (along with Mario 3D World) is one of the best looking games I’ve ever played and it truly feels ‘next gen’, a great display of what the Wii U can do. The amount of detail put into each of the tracks and backgrounds is wonderful, more than you’ll ever pick-up while zooming along. It’s a colourful visual feast throughout. The frame rate is a rock solid and smooth 60hz,only dropping in 3 or 4 player local play and the music played by a live band really adds energy to each track and brings the whole experience to life.

There’s plenty of content too. 32 tracks, 16 of which are new and all of which are great. Not a dud in the bunch. The 16 retro tracks have been so well done and changed to accommodate the new anti-grav and/or underwater elements that they feel almost like new tracks themselves. The battle mode however leaves a little to be desired due to the lack of battle arenas and use of a variety of the tracks instead. This is still quite fun but gets boring quickly and the addition of some arenas really would have improved this mode no end. There are plenty of characters to choose from but the roster is a little samey and the lack of Diddy Kong is a particular shame. One has to mention the brilliant and well balanced vehicle customisations though which offer a lot of variety and are a lot of fun to play around with to find your preferred combination of kart/bike, wheels, and glider.

The single player won’t take a seasoned pro long to complete and is made up of the usual 50, 100, and 150cc and mirror modes across 16 cups of varying difficulty but it’s in multiplayer where this game shines, particularly with the new refined online experience. The frame rate drops noticeably when over two players play locally which is a shame but is to be expected and this doesn’t stop the game being fun at all. It just loses a little of it’s polish. The online is magnificent. Tournaments allow for custom rulesets and times for tournaments to be open. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being able to join in on tournaments from my favourite online publications (Nintendo life etc) and to my experience the races run completely smoothly with lag a rare occurrence. Having 12 racers on the track from all over the world hurling shells at each other is honestly some of the most amazing fun I’ve had playing a video game in recent times, if not ever! Being able to play 2 player online is an excellent addition too.

In conclusion this is easily the best Mario Kart since 64 with the only things holding it back from a perfect score being the lack of battle arenas, the slightly disappointing roster and the over prevalence of the coin item. All in all Mario Kart 8 is some of the best fun you could ever have on a console. It really is that good. Drop dead gorgeous, thrilling gameplay and a rock solid and fun online mode make this a game I’ll be playing for a long, long time.

The only complaint I have of this game is that the battle mode only uses no battle courses. It only uses 8 courses that are used in regular racing mode, which is a huge let down for anyone who like to play battle mode.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ToFewViews,31-08-2014,"Mario Kart 8 did come out a few months ago, so if
you are one of the many people who bought a Wii-U
to play this game you already know how fun and amazing
it is. I picked up Mario Kart 8 the day it released
and didn't put it down tell I had beat all tracks
on 150cc. Then once you do that...You unlock all the
tracks in reverse! Leaving you with tons of races to
try and beat. The game also has a great online multilayer
letting you play 2 players online with one system. Online
has tournaments and a full ranking system to. The Graphics
to the game are some of the nicest I have seen on the Wii-U
since Super Mario 3D World. I find the game just about
perfect, I have only a few problems with the game. I
find the difficulty in the later races can be unfair
and very aggravating. Also would have been nice to see
more playable characters, seems like they filled the game
with Baby versions of main characters and all the Koopa Kids.
But over all this game is a must play!

In addition to all the new goodies and first time ever features in this newest Mario Kart release. You can also relive, or try for the first time various tracks from earlier game versions. All in all it is good clean single or multi player fun for the ENTIRE family, unlike most ""new games"" the game content is meant for ALL ages. loads of fun and challenging. I love playing with my young nieces and nephews.

isasif826,02-08-2014,"Oh Mario Kart, you will always be great fun no matter what medium you are experienced in.

The New Mario Kart 8, is a very fun and exiting addition to the Wii U console. With more characters and cars to choose from, there is plenty of fun to be had. The new tracks feel fresh but perhaps not as memorable as previous tracks such as rainbow road from GC, or music park 3DS. The new Graphics are fantastic, and the New item system brings a different playing field in terms of strategy and difficulty, that has not been seen in previous installments. This game really makes you focus on how well you can race, as opposed to how lucky you get with items.

Overall I will say this game is an 8, but only because it lacks a strong Battle system, which in my opinion, is one of the most fun features of a Mario Kart game. I would gladly sacrifice character and kart variation for some decent battle stages but that is just me. All in all, You will not be disappointed with Mario Kart 8.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
AuroreZell,07-08-2014,"This is by far the best Mario kart game released up to this point. My only real complaint about this game are some the of characters, and that's just nitpicking. The online feature works great and its a lot of fun to test your skills against other players. I would say that its worth getting a Wii U just to play this game, thats how much fun it is.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fruit-Dragon,07-08-2014,"I really loved this game. Like, really. This is the kind of game that shows off how great the console truly is, and it does it beautifully as well. Although it doesn't goes as fast as it could (it still goes fast, though) it makes up with it for it's truly amazing graphics. This game shows off how powerful a Wii U is (it's even adding DLC to make better in the future, and an update is coming soon) and it does it in the best way possible. 10/10 would play again.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JudeMattingly,13-08-2014,"Wonderful level design, amazing color palate, but a less than average character roster. Loading screens for a Mario Kart is odd as well. Great game overall just not as good as Double Dash.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Nickname,20-08-2014,"It might be fun if you play it casually, but if you really wanna play the game seriously online and aim for 1st place it's horrible. But this game has it's bright sides, so I'll adress these first. The visuals are gorgeus, by far the best-looking Wii U game yet. They even managed to bring the Koopalings unique personalities just by their animations. The game also runs at 60 frames per seconds unless you're driving in 3- or 4-Player mode, there's only 30 fps. The soundtrack is also great and memorable, especially the new renditions of the retro tracks' music are great. My only complaint is that the whistles on the remake of SNES Donut Plains 3 are missing except you're in 1st, but that's an extremely minor complaint. The Retro courses were remade really well and sometimes look like whole new courses. Only complaint is that few courses use the anti-gravity feature to its best. Memorable are only the Water Park loop, the spinning Mario Circuit and the few (often optional) sections where you drive on the walls while others stay on the ground, like in Thwomp Ruins or Toad's Turnpike, a returning track from Mario Kart 64. Also, all new tracks use Anti-Gravity atleast once and all Retro tracks use atleast one of Gliding, Diving and Anti-Gravity, new features introduced in Mario Kart 7 and 8. Rainbow Road is also a pretty huge letdown. Many expected a track that twists and turns all around the place like the Wario Colloseum track back on Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, but it's pretty linear and the coolest thing about it is where the track splits into two paths and you can jump from one to another to cut distance. But in the end, the track design is pretty solid and tracks like the disco stage Electrodrome and the adventurous and extremely diverse track Mount Wario are already fan favorites. The Single Player is what you'd expect from a Mario Kart game, GPs to unlock characters and vehicle parts ,returning from Mario Kart 7, Time Trials to compete for the best times on courses, VS races with custom rules and battle. Battle is the first big letdown since you battle on courses instead of arenas, but since I don't battle too often, it's not too big of a letdown for me. Offlien Multiplayer is one of the most fun parts of the game, since you can just drive casually with friends and family. Next is the roster, which has cut many fan favorite characters like Diddy Kong, King Boo or Dry Bones in favor of a golden reskin of Peach and a baby version of Rosalina, and all 7 Koopalings. While I miss Dry Bones, the Koopalings are more diverse then expected and fun to use. Online's features are neat but limited. Mario Kart TV leta you upload videos of your races to YouTube, but only 1 Minute highlights and you can't edit camera angles or anything. Tournaments are an evolution of MK7's communities, now you can edit the time where it goes, restrict characters etc. Only letdown is that tournaments can't be all day and have to pause for 1 hour daily. But now, for the online play. If you don't know what online play is, it's basically like offline racing, but you race against players from around the globe and gain ""VR"" for racing ""BR"" for battling. But unlike in Mario Kart Wii where it mostly showed a player's skill, in Mario Kart 8 it shows for how long you've been playing. Max VR is 9999 like in Mario Kart Wii, but you start at 1000 VR (you started at 5000 VR in Mario Kart Wii) and VR growth is slow... You don't lose about any VR on losing and gain not much, so it'll most likely take you a long time to gain VR. In Mario Kart Wii, however, you can lose your VR very fast. You mostly balance out at one number after enough races, and mostly keep it along with your skill level. But the biggest dread, the items. Maio Kart Wii was mostly criticised for rubber banding, but I think Mario Kart 8's item balance is even worse. Coin is mostly the most common item you get in 1st. This makes an incoming red shell as dangerous as a blue shell, especially since both slow you down about the same time. The most dangerous items? Shocks and Bananas. Why? Because Shells don't kick you around and put your speed at 0 anymore, while Bananas make you spin for an awfully long time. There are no invincibility frames after getting hit, so after a hitz prepare for many hits, since you can't do anything while flipping, but enemies still can hit you. THAT'S what kills all possible fun for me. You can't even be sure to get revenge after falling behind, since even in 10th Bananas or Triple Green Shells aren't too rare. The item system is horrible, and as someone that actually wants to do GOOD this doesn't help, neither does the fat you can only hold one item.

So, while playing it for fun is good, you can get super frustrated if you try to really play the game for ding good. So if you're okay with getting hit for unfair reasons, go buy this game! If you wanna play a fair game, play Mario Kart Wii online via the Custom Server ""Wiimmfi"" instead.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Justin7387100,25-08-2014,This game is freaking amazing! One of the best games and best looking on the wii u. This game alone made the wii u jump start all over again! But anyways lets get on to the review! Mario Kart 8 is hands down the best game i have ever played. It has stunning graphics and great tracks and controls are great! The items are a little sad this time around. When you are in first you'll get a coin alot. Online play is amazing but just be prepared for the really good Japan players.

BariothGuy,09-09-2014,"This is the perfect Mario Kart game. There's a ton of new gameplay mechanics and content but it still feels like Mario Kart. Even after you do everything you can in the single player modes and your friends/siblings get bored and want something different, you still can go online and race other people. The average player could get around 50 hours of gameplay out of it, but with new content on the way there's even more fun to be had. The only flaw are the battle mode tracks, but Nintendo will probably fix that too. A Wii U must have.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

tommyboy247,15-10-2014,"Now I was a huge fan for Mario Kart Wii. It was intense, colourful and took great advantage of the Wii motion controllers, however its home console successor was a bit of a disappointment because in every tournament its really scripted and repetitive when the same a.i. end up in the same position every time, its really really frustrating hat the Wii U gamepad is really awkward to use as a motion controller so you just have to use the standard controller which is really boring, you can use the wii remote but anyone who didnt own a Wii before hand or didnt buy a remote with the system will have to stick with the boring gamepad, and the last problem is paid DLC. Now this game isnt all bad, it can still be fun because its georgus visuals, great soundtrack, fun online sessions, brillient level design and when its not repeditive its really thrilling.

dkxcalibur,05-11-2014,"The best in the series for sure! One of the best games on the Wii U for sure! One of the best looking games on any system!

The tracks are brilliantly designed and each one feels unique. The tracks are bright, colorful, and beautiful. The music that accompanies each track is perfect and you'll have them stuck in your head for days. I believe they are performed by an orchestra. Every character that you care about from the world of Mario are present. I could have done with less baby characters and a few more Mario enemies but they don't take away from anything. The controls are perfect. I prefer the classic style of control but the motion control is included and has been improved upon Mario Kart Wii's motion controls. The online features have also been improved and there are a lot more options when racing online then in past games from the series.

Since release, it's been announced that DLC is on the way that will bring Link and Animal Crossing characters; and both additional track and karts to the game in the future.

Stop questioning if the Wii U has games. Buy a Wii U and buy this game!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kahisys,10-11-2014,"Nintendo kept a good path and created another Mario Kart that'd remain a must-buy for its system. It holds to the series by making a hectic racing game with gorgeous and/or fun tracks to play through. We get what we ask for : sense of mess, speed and fun.

Enhanced with the quicker reload of the item boxes, it is easier to get items to beat others with...or to be beat with. The new tracks are damn fun and very well put together, and the remakes of the old ones fit well the new gimmick of this opus, which is the anti-gravity racing. Said gimmick is also worth noticing as it allows a new point of view on racing, making you bump into other racers to get a speed boost instead of avoiding them as usual.

The online is a big part of the game, and of course it's well organized, making it easy to join whenever you wish to get some challenge from across the world, either against strangers or your friends. Sadly I can't review on the quality of the connection since mine is naturally very bad.

Some would complain about the lack of character diversity, which I could get behind, but it's not dramatic or that much of a bother. Also, the anti-gravity isn't that much noticeable since the camera always adapts to you. Those details are just a bit of nitpicking.

2 DLCs are planned so far, for a price that is very correct seing it adds in total 4 more cups. Nintendo seems to know how to balance their prices on DLCs.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

TrueIcee,20-12-2014,"Mario Kart 8 isn't really anything new, but it still makes a fun racer for the whole family to enjoy from time to time. The tracks are really great, mainly thanks to the new Anti-Gravity gimmick that ties the whole function of Mario Kart 7 together. I think that I should mention that this game's presentation is top notch. It looks very nice, while running at 60 FPS with one or two players, online included.

The 32 Tracks shouldn't leave you bored, especially with some really good new tracks, like the Electrodrome and Mount Wario, and even fan favorite N64 Rainbow Road makes it's return.

That doesn't mean this game isn't without it's problems. Honestly, this game's roster is easily one of the worst of a Mario Kart game. Half of the game's 30 characters are just clones of others, and fan favorites like Diddy and Birdo are missing. Function wise, the Coin power-up can completely break the item balance, ultimately dooming the person in 1st even more so then ever, Super Horn or not. The online may not be perfect, but for the most part it runs rather well, but be prepared for some random disconnects once in a blue moon.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a good racing experience for the Wii U. I highly recommend it.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

DBPirate1129,10-01-2015,"As a big fan of the past two installments in the series, you'd probably be able to imagine how excited I was for Mario Kart 8. I was even more excited to discover that Mario Kart 8 surpassed my expectations by a long shot.

The courses in the game are the best yet, both new and old. The new anti-gravity mechanic adds a breath of fresh air to the races. Add to that the gliding and underwater sections from MK7 and you've got yourself some of the best courses in any racing game ever made. Particular standouts include Toad Harbor, Shy Guy Falls, every course from the Star Cup, Cloudtop Cruise, Bowser's Castle, and Rainbow Road. The music is also simply fantastic. It can't be denied it's the best music in the series yet.

The character roster still isn't as good as Wii but at this point, who cares? It does everything else bigger and better! I was much more engaged in the kart customization than I was in 7 with more parts to choose from. I'm still not a fan of the 10-coin limit but it doesn't ruin the game as a whole. It's nice to see bikes return as I usually raced on them more than in karts in MKWii.

Mario Kart 8 shows off the best online in the series with superb connection, a great new course voting system, and the genius new addition of Mario Kart TV. Mario Kart TV allows you to view your highlights or entire races and do lots of cool stuff with them like putting it in slow-motion. The glorious visuals really shine thanks to this addition. The only true downside in the game is battle mode which is a massive downgrade compared to Wii and 7. Instead of racing on battle arenas, you race on actual courses which is a shame.

Stroot,05-02-2015,This is a great game and a must-own for the Wii U. The online racing experience is smooth and the courses are a fun mix of new and updated classics. The only major complaint is the lack of battle mode arena courses. Instead of creating battle mode arena courses Nintendo decided to just make the regular courses available for battle mode. Seems like a lazy move by Nintendo and probably the result of needing to meet a deadline. It doesn't completely take away from the main experience of the game play and still receives a very high score.,9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Supermoose,31-05-2015,"This is an amazing game! The Mariokart gameplay is better than ever with new items and mechanics. The new ""anti-gravity"" mechanic may seem gimmicky and useless, but it actually changes the gameplay quite a bit. Most if not all of the courses are really good, Mount Wario being a personal favorite. The music is awesome, and the DLC is also really great. And despite being on the less powerful Wii U, this game is still prettier to look at than most games out. The one negative to this game is battle mode, which gets rid of the arena-style battle courses of the previous games, and instead uses the race tracks for battles. it is a minor flaw when compared to the rest of the game. But other than that the game is fantastic.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

WackoDaSniper,15-05-2015,"Great Mario Kart, easily my 2nd fav mario kart next to double dash. The graphics are superb finally a 1080p mario kart. Although it could use some anti aliasing. The tracks are cool and the soundtrack is the best ive ever seen in mario kart. The online is thriving too. Must have wii u game and a lot better than mario kart 7",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Gold_Grande,08-03-2017,"Mario Kart 8 is a release that tries to bring many new things to the Mario Kart franchise. With a great online scene, there is always something to do. The stages and courses look better than ever and the soundtrack is top of the line. But while those things are terrific, the game tries a bit too much with the zero gravity driving and the paragliding. I feel like I have much less control over my kart compared to previous titles. I do not think those additions where refined enough. The item roulette is pretty bad in the game with distribution of items being weird. Blue shell not being able to fly feels like a minus. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game but not one I'd marry. I'm happy to give this a 6/10. Decent.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
MEJO86,30-03-2015,"Very well made racing game with awesome graphics! Nice tracks and a variety of veichles to choose from. The driver rooster could have been better where you have characters such as Baby Mario/Luigi/Peach/Daisy/Rosalina, Metal Mario and last but not least Pink gold Peach instead of say Diddy Kong, Hammer bro or Birdo. But apart from that the rooster is fine (but why is Donkey Kong a cruiser weight?). The balance of items are fixed which means you won't get a blue shell up your *ss as soon as you are in first place.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Brandonthegamer,08-04-2015,"Mario Kart is the one of the games that are still fun even if they release in every console. It does not matter is a game gets too many sequels as long it is still entertaining. I suggest to finish this game and then use the online mode to test out your skills. Mario Kart is like Super Smash Bros mainly because you will still find competition online and even find some streams on twitch to interact with. Fun for friends, family, and strangers.

2cben,07-09-2015,"A great game, it is fast, fun and pretty. If you like Mario kart buying a Wii U just for this game is worth it. The online mode (sadly not perfect but I'll come to that later) will give you hundreds of hour of game time.

What I like:
- There are so much details put in most of tracks it is just insane! Some tracks are definitely better than others though.
- It's really smooth, the framerate does not see any drop in 1 player mode. in 3 or 4 players it feels really slow at the beginning and then you get use to it.
- It's a complete delight to drive, the control feels very good and responsive.
- Items are better balanced than in Mario kart Wii even if I would personally reduce the likelyhood of getting strong item (a little less red/blue shells, stars ...)

The following change in online mode would be VERY welcome:

- Your online score does not mean that much, something more like the World of warcraft pvp arena rating (at least the way it used to be at the beginning) would be much better.
- Along side your score a few stats would be very welcome. Like your average position, how many races in total played, I would love to know that the dude who's been beating me for the last half hour actually played 100000 races (or actually 10!)
- Being able to pick from 4 races is not enough and seriously is it purely random??? I feel like some races NEVER appear.

One last thing, more DLC please!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

elephantmobber,22-06-2015,Definitely a very large part of why I purchased a Wii U. This game is phenomenal. It is very inventive for the eighth game in a seemingly endless series. The levels and additional downloadable content (Link ftw!) also make this game even more spectacular. Definitely worth the $72 (after DLC) for this game. Multiplayer capability is also very nice and it easily connects to the internet for you to play with randos everywhere.,10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
UltraTektite,26-08-2015,"Mario Kart 8 isn't revolutionary, but it's without a doubt the most polished and graphically impressive Mario Kart game to date. It's not the new items, new characters, or anti gravity gimmick that make this game great, but the absolutely beautiful graphics and detail, great online mode, and the return of the beloved Mario Kart formula. The only big disappointment was battle mode which sucks now, but that blow was softened by the fact that nobody expected a ton from it because MKWii's and MK7's battle modes were already not as good as those of their predecessors.

In conclusion Mario Kart 8's main selling feature (the anti grav) really didn't add much to the game, but that didn't stop the outstanding gameplay and graphics from making this game a worthwhile buy for any Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It's controls are perfects, it's visuals sublime, and it is without a doubt the best selection of levels, made all the more sweeter with the best DLC packs any game has ever offered. It's new features all turn out to be excellent additions to the series and the weapon selection is by the best and most balanced.
Online play works brilliantly and you are likely to spend most of your time playing online.
Mario Kart 8 is a work of craftsmanship which makes most other AAA titles look unrefined and amateurish.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Sound: The soundtrack is a mix of pop, jazz and rock, and it's extremely catchy.

Gameplay: The new items and vehicles make the game easy to play.

Multiplayer/Extras: Tons of tracks and vehicle customization options. The online mode is fun too, with you having the ability to share your replays on YouTube.

RuiPTG,24-08-2015,"The game looks and plays great, but there are a few minor things that it forgot to borrow from the Wii version to allow it to reach higher greatness.

Cosmozerk,26-02-2016,"This without a doubt this is the best Mario Kart there has ever been.
STORY: NONE watsoever.

PRESENTATION: Man, this game is just a pleasure to look at, the 60fps, 1080p, the weather and lighting effects, the moddeles, the animations, the music, pretty much everything in mario kart 8 is great looking and well done.

GAMEPLAY: The item and character balance is the best in the entire series, the CPU doesn't cheat, the new items are very fun to use, the new courses are awesome, the modes 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, mirrorcc and the new 200cc are all as fun as they always were and the online work's very well, the only 2 issues i have with the game is the battle mode, which takes place in normal arenas, making it easy to not even see your opponent and the roster, even with the dlc, the roster is not the best, there are so many baby characters, and koopalinks, and marios, and peachs, etc, i mean seriously, why cut diddy kong or dry bones, or why not add more original characters like Captain Falcon, Sonic, Pac-man, etc, i mean the roster is not terrible, like is good to see some animal crossing characters, and link from the legend of zelda, but you still have to buy those characters (don't get me wrong, the dlc in this game is sweet, but....still).
Overall mario kart 8 is nearly a perfect game and if nintendo decides to do a dlc pack 3 which added more characters like the one's i mentioned and fix the battle mode then i would not doubt to give this game a 10/10, but as it stands mario kart 8 gets a 9/10",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SuperMatt777,12-12-2015,"Mario Kart 8 plays as good as it looks. The courses are not only dynamic, but a pleasure to look at, with all of them filled with detail. Even the retro tracks look beautiful with their nice re-designs. The roster of characters is a bit of a mix, having an equal amount of interesting adds (such as the Koopalings) and pointless adds (such as Baby Rosalina and Pink Gold Peach). While it was nice that the kart part unlocking criteria wasn't nearly as time consuming as it was in Mario Kart 7, I still think that there could've been a better method. All in all, I'd highly recommend Mario Kart 8 to any Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Zorua,04-02-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is easily the best Wii U game out there. A fantastic combination of fun racing but challenging courses, the Mario Kart series has always been popular with a certain breed of gamers. Mario Kart 8 is easily the best out of all the entries in the series, with stunning HD graphics, fun and interesting new items and characters, and challenging courses creating a fantastic hybrid of genres for the Wii U title.
First off, character selection. Everyone's favourite veterans return, with the likes of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser and many more taking to the track once again, though there are some characters that perhaps should've been included but were ultimately left out. A whole range of new characters such as the Koopalings and Baby Rosalina also add new characters for you to race with, though some characters *cough cough Pink Gold Peach* are quite bizarre and in my opinion don't deserve a spot over the likes of Diddy Kong or Bowser Jr.
Nintendo have also introduced a whole new range of items, which include the Super Horn, Piranha Plant and Boomerang, as well as Coins returning from Mario Kart 7. As is traditional with the Mario Kart series, a whole new host of courses are introduced, which also incorporate the new anti-gravity feature, which allows for a F-Zero-like experience. There are also a whole new range of Retro courses from previous Mario Kart games which give you a blast to the past to the likes of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart DS.
Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a highly fun game that only gets better when playing online or with friends. Two lots of DLC have also been released, which add characters, karts, and courses, and although I would've liked to seen maybe Diddy Kong or Bowser Jr. in one of this packs, there could still be more. The only criticism I have with this game is the Battle Mode, with Battle Mode instead being played on regular courses, which massively nerfs it. Apart from that, the game is one of the best I've played, and I'd recommend to buy a Wii U just to play it.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Djungelorm,27-09-2016,"This game is easily the weakest in the series in my opinion.
Playing offline multiplayer is when Mario Kart 8 is at its best, and is still fun. The graphics are great and the track design, when taking into account the redesigned retro tracks, is the best in the series, with antigravity allowing for more freedom and possibilities in track design, for example driving down a waterfall or along the side of a building.
Now for a note on battle mode.. This time around you battle on racetracks, which can make it hard to find opponents. The worst thing, however, is the absence of a coin / shine collection battle mode - you can only do balloon battles.
There is one glaring flaw with Mario Kart 8, however: the item system, which seems as though it has been designed to ruin the fun for all competitive players. Getting powerful items like triple red shells in second place is now likely, and since you are forbidden from dangling one item while storing another in reserve, the leader has no defense and will inevitably be killed, and most likely fall to the back, hence minimizing the skill in winning a race. Seriously, I would say race performance is about 20% skill and 80% luck (on average), which is fine when you're playing with friends, but not when you're playing online, trying to improve your ranking.
If you're playing for fun with family or friends, this game is ideal and guaranteed to give you a fun experience. But if you, like me are competitive and serious about playing online at a high level, this is not the game for you.

Arilio,20-08-2016,"This game is pure perfection. Everything about it is amazing. The course design is so creative and the add of antigravity feature makes some awsome levels. The soundtrack is just great and many of the old tracks got a little bit changed. I see many people that are saying that the remake of rainbow road from mario kart 64 is terrible. I definitely disagree with that. The original was so long and boring. In the remake the backround, the music and the 3 sections instead of laps are great. Also the add of DLC and 200cc mode makes the game even better. Last but not least, the item balance is the best. Why? Let's say you are second and you want to go first. In the old games you could hold two items. Now you take an item and it's a red shell. In the older versions of mario kart the first player could have for example triple bananas and a green shell, so it was unpossible to hit him. I mean it might be more difficult to go from 6th to 1st but still if you are first then you don't have to worry that much if you can hold a good defensive item and if you are second you have a higher chance of hitting the first racer.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

wariothelegend,27-07-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is easily the best game in the series to date. With it's vast amount of content and HD visuals, you're not going to regret buying this game. It's great for both beginners and experts. It even has a downloadable content!

Mario Kart 8's gimmick is the anti-gravity system, which allows you to race up walls or even the ceiling. Bumping into another racer gives you a satisfying spin-boost and which can be used as a strategy to what angle you bump a racer in so that only you will benefit. Mario Kart 8 also includes new items like the Boomerang Flower, Piranha Plant, Crazy 8 and finally an item that stops the invincible Blue Spiny Shell, the Super Horn.

Now with every game there's always a minor set back, and Mario Kart 8 is no different. It's character choices are very questionable, such as it's over load of baby counterpart, and Pink Gold Peach. But even that's not a major set back from this brilliant artwork. A family-fun party game that will truly amaze you!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GoodGameAnyway,29-07-2016,"One of the best games on Wii U, but unfortunately not quite as good as Mario Kart Wii. With more ""balanced"" items, the game has lost its 12-player craziness many players loved in Mario Kart Wii. If MKWii was still available to play online this would be okay, but due to Wi-Fi Connection being shut down, this is one sad disaster for me.

However, the tracks and the visuals are cool. DLC is among the best I've ever seen. That still won't fix the broken gameplay choices.

Also, do not expect to be able to choose tracks online freely: you have to pick one out of three randomly selected or an another random track.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
el_Ithur,31-07-2016,"Excelente Mario Kart, al nivel del Double Dash. Visualmente perfecto, buen diseño. Recomendado 100% vale la pena invertir en una WiiU para disfrutar este juego. Infinitamente superior a la desdichada versión de wii.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
taxmanfan,10-01-2017,the game was cool at everything! but if you don't have the DLCs it's a very short game that you can finish in just one hour :/ apart from all the gamemodes,8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

veedub,06-09-2016,"By far the best racing game I've ever played. The track designs are all great; there aren't any tracks that I genuinely dislike, and that's really saying something because I usually dislike at least one track. The addition of the glider, antigravity mode and submersible modes greatly adds to the gameplay that has been refined over the previous 7 titles. And the addition of 200cc mode brings back the ""HOLY CRAP THIS IS TOO FAST"" experience most of us enjoyed from the F-Zero series. (Not to mention in the DLCs having Mute City and Big Blue tracks).

Antigravity mode greatly expands the creativity of the track designs; the tracks can (and do!) fold over on themselves. One track is a giant Mobius strip; another track has a section that loops around on itself to become the outer wall of its own turn, then has a section where the track splits and you have opposing track sections upside-down from each other.

The game accommodates a full range of difficulty levels, from being easy enough that a 5 year old can win, to being difficult enough that even the most expert racer will have a hard time holding on to the top spots.

There was only one disappointment I had. Battle Mode sucks. As recently as Mariokart Wii (6th in the series) there was a robust battle mode with open course layout for battle. In Mariokart 8, those are gone, and have been replaced with simply battling on race tracks. (At least the tracks eligible for battle are designed so they can be traversed equally well both backward and forward). And it's particularly disappointing because the new antigrav, submarine and kite modes could have added so much depth to the battles.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Stlouzilla,01-10-2016,Mario Kart 8 delivers on the pedigree that has become expected of the franchise and delivers one of the all around most polished and fun experiences available on the Wii U.,9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Gregorylol,15-10-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is an inspiring and an amazing game. With smooth graphics and amazing gameplay, I don't get tired playing this game. The anti-gravity feature is a nice feature that adds a little touch to the Mario Kart series. The maps are arguably the best in the series. The things that disappoint in this game are the Battle Mode. Nintendo took out the battle only maps, and put them in the race maps. In online races, you're not allowed to pick from all of the maps, which sucks ass. However, all in all, this game is in the top 10 best Wii U games, and is definitely worth a try. I believe you should buy this game.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fercreador,29-03-2017,"Es un juego simplemente fantastio, que me ha dado muchas horas, quiero decir que este juego probablemente sea de los mejores mario kart, por no decir el mejor, la implementacion de los nuevos item son maravillosos, cambian el juego bastante, como el poder visual de pasar por las paredes y techos",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Coleybuddy,07-11-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is the best of all of the Mario Kart games I have played so far. Its main attraction is its graphics which look amazing when playing in full HD. I have decided to list the positives and negatives of this game.

Positives:

-The tracks are very creative and fun. This especially goes for the tracks taken from previous games since they are given an updated look and have the new features implemented into them, but are still kept as close to the original as possible.
-Online play is very fun with very little lag. I also like how you can have someone else play online mode on the same console.
-The DLC adds a huge amount of extra content with its three different packs. These packs add new karts, characters, and tracks to the already huge collection of content.
-The customization of karts returns from Mario Kart 7 and has even more variety.
-As I already said, the graphics are amazing. They are probably the best that I have seen on the WiiU so far.

Negatives:

-Most people will agree that the game's only noticeable flaw is the battle mode. I do agree that it was lazily made with there only being normal tracks available instead of the battle arenas that were present in the previous games.

Overall, this game is one of the most impressive games available on the WiiU and I would definitely recommend it.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ellocopepe96,27-11-2016,"primero que todo este juego es muy bueno y divertido como todos los mario karts los escenarios están muy bien hechos los graficos de puta madre , el juego va muy fluido , diversion asegurada.
Pero para mi no esta a la altura de los anteriores juegos de la saga , lo encuentro un poco vacio , el modo batalla no esta trabajado, no hay escenarios especificos para ese modo como en todos los otros mario karts , hay muchos personajes que no pintan ni con cola xd como los secuaces de bowser o toadette o peach de oro rosa que son mas bien de relleno , hubiesen metido a diddy kong o funky kong o bowsitos desde antes y no en un dlc o bowser jr etc . Algunas pistas son muy aburridas , la musica es normalita no me gusto que casi cada tema del juego tuviese trompetas todo el tiempo y muchas veces la musica pasa a segundo plano y no se escucha casi nada ya que ni siquiera te da la opcion de bajarle a los efectos de sonido del juego y dejar la música en un volumen mas alto. yo creo que eso es algo esencial hoy en dia ,que un juego te permita bajar o subir el volumen de cada sonido del juego .
y lo de los dlc es lo peor osea ¿que paso nintendo xD ? ya esta mal hacer dlc´s pero los dlcs que pusieron son de risa lo unico que vale la pena de los dlc son link ,bowsitos y algunas pistas nuevas, pero aun asi se nota que al juego le falto mas cariño.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Captain_Faramir,14-04-2017,"8.9 - Another great Mario Kart, although it lacked battle mode, and had the same issue of 1st to 12th as mentioned in my Mario Kart Wii review. Other than that, additional characters and DLC was well done, and online gameplay was fun.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Thiagomii,05-03-2017,"este juego sencillamente se lleva el puesto a el juego de Wii U que mejor se ve, los gráficos son hermosos y cada circuito se ve alucinante, siendo los circuitos retro los que ahora mismo se ven a su mayor esplendor, con música remixeada y la mayoría con mejoras notorias. Además de buenos gráficos tiene una jugabilidad excelente, aunque no es fácil jugar a la primera, los derrapes son difíciles de perfeccionar, por lo cual no es tan divertido al jugarlo con mis amigos.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
KingPorky,08-03-2017,"There is no much to say about that game besides the fact that is Mario Kart, I have a lot of fun, all courses on this game felt imaginative and the zero-gravity feature is cool, but not groundbreakin, the main problem of this game for me is the lack of a properly battle mode, but still, one of the most fun Kart games that I ever played",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
bilbyc0m,08-03-2017,"Nintendo once again puts out another fantastic Mario Kart game, also bringing a new fresh game play dynamic in the form of gravity, the ability to go up or on the side of walls with your kart. Mario Kart does everything it intends to at a smooth 60FPS. Its a blast with friends and a blast online. My one quarrel is the lack of voice chat for online. Other than that great job Nintendo, can't wait for this game on the switch.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Jimez,13-03-2017,"Mario Kart 8, one of the best Mario Kart games ever made. A great selection of tracks, some tracks remade in glorious HD. And, it's being remade for the Switch too. Can't fault it, perfect game for some great single player time trials and online mode. Only flaw is no voice chat, but otherwise a great game.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
CH513,08-07-2017,"After the drop Mario Kart 7 was, the 8th game is a very decent improvement. The race tracks here are overall much better than those from MK7. The music is very memorable, the visuals are stunning for a Mario game, the redesigned tracks from previous games feel fresh and the online has a very good quality. But the 8/10 has its reasons: the character roster is by far the worst in the series, the difficulty is average, character voices are annoying, the new anti-gravity system is barely noticeable, the items are just too unbalanced for my liking and the game has the worst Battle mode in the series. Overall Mario Kart 8 will give you a lot of fun, but it will still leave much to be desired.

(On a side note, I know the Battle mode is fixed in MK8 Deluxe, but at the time of writing this review, I have not played it yet).",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

ProGamer88,11-10-2017,"Mario kart as a franchise, throughout its 25-year history, has become not only one of Nintendo's go-to-games but also a firm classic in many gamers opinions. The latest full game installment to this franchise, Mario kart 8 for the Wii U, brings about more of the same traditional Mario kart with a breath of fresh air to keep this classic relevant in the modern era of gaming.
The core of the single-player campaign gameplay remains almost the same as the previous game in the franchise. You choose from a selected roster of characters (most of which feature in previous Mario games) and race in grand prix consisting of 4 pre-determined races in order to unlock new characters, kart or bike choices or further grand prix.
Of course, if you're on your own you don't have to play the single-player campaign; you can also set up a casual race, play in the battle mode or if you have an internet connection you can take your game to the online multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is the best yet in the franchise with a suitable ranking system that has you racing against players with various skill levels in order to extend your own personal score. The downside to this being that you can sometimes get into games with a limited number of players; this can cause the race to lose its competitive edge.
In comparison to the previous games, Mario kart 8 looks stunning with a high definition glaze. As you glide around the colourful courses with your slick wheels twisting and turning you can't help but have fun.
Despite its many upsides, you can't help feeling that Nintendo has finally hit their last peak for the franchise.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
FS_Lover,11-04-2018,"I'm not very satisfied with this game, the only thing I appreciated was the graphics, which are very good, but there are many things that disappoint me... This isn't a pure Mario Kart, because there are characters from universes other than Mario's. Notice that I'm not saying that I'm disappointed that there are characters from other universes, but I am disappointed that Mario characters weren't given priority. There are many Mario characters they could have used, such as Birdo, like in Mario Kart Wii, or doctor Toadley, shroob, princess shroob, kamek, fawful, kylie koopa, cackletta, popple. There are so many Mario characters to choose from, there's no need to get characters from other series.
Another thing I dislike about MK8 are the physics. They're odd and you go faster if you hop.
The characters' voices are too quiet compared to the background music that you hear much more. On top of that, the characters don't have enough voice clips, unlike Mario Kart Wii.
I also dislike the rearranged tracks, particularly Wario Stadium. I think they could have done a better job with them.
t's a great thing that the retro tracks have been improved, however, they have been modified a bit , which is something they should have avoided. Again, Wario Stadium is a good example of this Another bad thing about this game is the way the objects work. For example, if you keep a banana peel behind you, it doesn't disappear from the object icon like it should.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SonicSpeedo92,21-05-2018,"Nintendo really went all out with this one... But it's not the best entry in the franchise. Mario kart 8 has a large selection of fun tracks, characters and karts, amazing HD visuals, fantastic music, the gravity mechanic and online play that actually works. But, h o w e v e r, the battle mode is the crappiest in the series. but MK8 is still a solid title.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JuanPablo21G,26-06-2018,"Este juego es muy bueno, ya que implementa varios circuitos nuevos y recopila algunos clásicos de otras consolas como DS y Wii, posee una amplia cantidad de personajes jugables y aprovecha la potencia del Wii U dándole gráficos HD buenos, y sin bajones de fps. También es muy bueno el modo online, multijugador, los 2 DLC. Sin duda este Mario Kart, junto con el de Nintendo Switch, son los dos mejores Mario Kart, los definitivos. El único detalle en contra es el modo batalla que no es tan complejo, pero de resto, el juego es de lo mejor de Wii U.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

gamingstinky_,10-11-2019,"Mario Kart is one of the most popular video game franchises, and that is for a reason. From SNES to Switch, Mario kart never failed to innovate. Each game felt incredibly different than the others. The SNES version was the first, the classic. This game worked incredibly well for the hardware that it is running on. Mario kart 64 was the official switch to 3d, and it ran a lot more smoothly than the SNES version. After 64 came super circuit, which was just insane to me. It basically is the SNES version, it does not have a lot of differences, but it does look better than SNES, even though it runs on a Gameboy Advance, which is a really crappy system, from a visual, audio and hardware- perspective. It is just crazy to me how this Mario kart runs so well on such a **** platform. After that came double dash, with a completely different concept than the rest of the games, with two characters in one car. For many people, this is their favorite of the series. Mario Kart DS was also really good and was very impressive fort he system that it was one. It had a really fun singleplayer mode, which no Mario Kart ever really had, and it was the first handheld Mario Kart that didn’t feel watered down. Then in comes Mario Kart Wii, with a complete do-over on the controls, with some motion sickness included. A lot of people adore these controls, I despise them. I hate this game, the tracks are amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the roster is amazing, but the gameplay got **** up because Nintendo didn’t give an option to race with the d-pad on the Wii mote. All of these games still are pretty amazing, but all of them lack extremely when you look at the newer games.

The reason Mario Kart 8 overshadows all the others, is because of the insane tracks, the upbeat songs, the amazing retro races and the Nintendo lasagne that is the Mario Kart 8 roster. Let’s start with the tracks.

The tracks in this game are absolutely mental from start to finish. Everything starts with Mario Kart Stadium, a track that is short, sweet, and gives a really good demonstration on the whole wall riding gimmick this game has adapted. It then continues with gems like Water Park, Sweet Sweet Canyons, Toad Harbor, Twisted Mansion and the best track of this game: Shy Guy Falls. These are only the two first cups, which there are 12 of. The tracks are insane, (Pokerap starts playing) Mount Wario, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodome, Bone Dry Dunes, Ice Ice Outpost, Circuit HYRULE?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The songs are also amazing, there is not one that sucks. Of course, there are absolute jams like Yoshis Valley, Shy Guy Falls, Ribbon Roads, Wario Stadium, Electro Dome, Music Park. These are certainly the best, but the others are amazing too. Oh yeah, I forgot the Animal Crossing one. WAIT, ANIMAL CROSSING?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The retro tracks have always sucked. They were never memorable and they were just exploiting nostalgia for money. I thought it was going to be like that for Mario Kart 8, too, but it was quite the contrary actually. It was like they were completely new tracks. Toads Turnpike now had a completely different route on the walls, You could drive underwater at Cheep Cheep Beach and Wario Stadium felt different with the Z- and water section. The retro tracks were refreshing and a total blast, they were nostalgic and original at the same time. It was amazing.

All of this makes for a great game, and the roster was pretty fine too. Although Pink Gold Peach really ground my gears. And the baby's are just a joke. Baby Rosalina? Really Nintendo? Nintendo? I think Reggie was too busy playing animal crossing new leaf on the new Nintendo 3ds during the development of this game because this is a joke. But these are just 5 characters, the rest are just classics. They even brought in the WAH himself.

But there is one reason, that I have been hinting at very generously, why this game, in particular, is so exciting. On a juicy day called 13 November 2014, an update dropped. Link, the hero himself, got added tot he roster. Everybody went crazy. There also was an F-Zero track in the DLC-pack. This meant a lot. Mario Kart wasn’t just Mario Kart anymore, and this DLC and DLC-pack 2 proved this. This is the reason this game is so amazing, it marks the beginning of a new era. Who knows who we’ll get next. Will a wild Pokémon appear in the next game? Will Olimar pick a fight wit hall the Mario man? Will Kirby return to racing, like in Kirby Airride? It is all very exciting, Mario Kart just turned into Smash Kart, and I love it.

Mario Kart 8 innovates, brings new ideas to the table and is extremely impressive with its audio and it is visually also very impressive. I give Mario Kart 8 a 9/10, because the online is still very limited.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

joel_tdl,21-12-2019,"La siguiente reseña fue publicada originalmente en 3djuegos:

De lo mejor en WiiU

JUGABILIDAD:
Jugabilidad clásica de los Kart con buen uso del Gamepad. Me ha gustado que las Copas se desbloqueen conforme a los resultados de las carreras. Hablando de ellas... pues son increíbles. Tanto las originales como los Remakes de las retro.
Poder jugarlo con botones, acelerómetro del Gamepad u otros periféricos es excelente.

GRÁFICOS:
Las pistas son preciosas, es indiscutible que se esforzaron por hacer notar un salto gráfico demostrando así el poder del WiiU que tanto fue cuestionado. El simple hecho de recorrerlas, hasta quitando de lado la competitividad, hace que el juego valga la pena.

SONIDO:
Las piezas son muy buenas, muy emocionantes y acertadas. Los efectos especiales pueden llegar a ser algo molestos al cabo de un rato, sobre todo si lo que se quiere es apreciar la música (como en mi caso), pero da una genial ambientación a cada carrera.

INNOVACIÓN:
Me ha agradado la customización, aunque no sea una innovación tal cual. Mario Kart 8 se queda con una jugabilidad clásica pero tan bien lograda que la carencia de originalidad pasa a segundo plano",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
CB186,05-01-2020,"This is my favourite game on the Nintendo Wii U. No Question.
All the new tracks are amazing with some of the best tracks in the whole series: Shy Guy Falls, Wild Woods, Super Bell Subway and Cloudtop Cruise. The retro tracks are completely different from the originals. DS Wario Stadium is barely recognisable from the original and its amazing what Nintendo have done here. This game is gorgeous.

The vehicle customisation is back from Mario Kart 7 and it hasn't changed. But, it never needed too. The new big feature is anti-gravity. This is fantastic on the highlight reel but aside from the speed boosts you can get from bumping into other racers, it doesn't really change the gameplay at all. This is one of the two flaws to this fantastic package.

The DLC is also sublime adding 16 new tracks, 6 new characters including Link and Villager and more vehicle customisation. However, Battle Mode is the worst it has ever been. There are 0 new battle tracks and race tracks are used to have battles on. Its a real shame as this loses this game a 10/10 for me.

However, this is a sublime game and one of the best Mario kart experiences I have ever had.
Amazing Work Nintendo!!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

This game much like his predecessor -Mario kart 7- gives you the ability to costumise your kart combination by using different tires gliders and karts. The game is lots of fun, and more can be added with the DLC wich -at really reasonable price -add 6 more characters ,8 new karts -5 karts 2 bikes and 1 ATM-, and four more cups ,wich are the Egg cup,Triforce cup,Crossing cup and finally Bell cup.

SirSoil,28-02-2020,"Mario Kart 8 is an excellent racing game with many unique tracks modes and features, however there is some issues here and there. First of all the character selection is weak yes you have your Mario bowser peach Luigi but there was a chance to bring obscure Mario characters but no you get 5 baby characters 2 metal versions of characters and a bunch of nobody’s from the new super Mario games. However the customization is great, sadly whatever you chose changes your states which is kinda of a bummer. However the tracks make up for it, all the tracks are amazing with their very own style and unique designs. The modes are appreciated, but sadly the maps I think are to big for the battle modes. Online for the most part is alright it works...sometimes. Mario Kart 8 isn’t the best racing game ever but it tries to and does it well in the tracks and modes, I just wish there was more variety in the characters and more options, like don’t make the customization change your states or make the battle maps smaller.

The character roster is alright and could be a bit better but most of the characters are pretty solid. But the main thing drawing this game back is the lack of a good battle mode. It's one of the biggest multiplayer factors for Mario Kart and is just not good in this game.

MadIsAdopted,20-11-2022,"I don't usually play any racing games, but damn, Mario Kart 8 is a true masterpiece.

Every track is literally a sandbox, which gives you multiple opportunities to choose a way to reach the finish line. Moreover, you can't fall off the track, which makes the game much less frustrating.

Graphics are top-notch. Everything is unbelievably smooth, colorful and eye-appealing. Framerate is very stable as well, so game runs perfectly.

Overall MK8's gameplay makes for a very fun gameplay. Rules are easy and the game itself is literally 'Easy to learn, hard to master'. Moreover, it contains the local- and net multiplayer, which gives you tens of hours of unstoppable pleasure.

I wish there was a better feeling of progression though. There're aren't actually any motivators for you to play so you have to find any goals yourself. At the end of the day, nothing but Silent Hill 2 is perfect, isn't it?",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

nintendofan721,28-02-2022,"A great instalment of the Mario Kart franchise with a few problems. First off, the track selection is amazing and they all look graphically phenomenal. There are lots of unique tracks like Sunshine Airport, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodrome, Mount Wario and more. This game also has the best retro track selection in the series so far, they’re all really fun to play and they have all been heavily updated with some tracks being barely recognizable like the GBA tracks and N64 Rainbow Road. The character selection is okay but not great. There are several important characters missing like Birdo, Dry Bones, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr and King Boo, while it introduces a couple bad choices being Baby Rosalina and the worst Mario character ever, Pink Gold Peach! The music in this game is all live orchestrated which is a nice touch. This game’s main new mechanic is the anti gravity, which was an interesting idea and works very well. Online mode returns and it’s very solid. I do like the items they introduced in this game like the Piranha Plant and Super horn, but the item distribution is terrible. For example, you can get triple red shells in second or a coin in fifth. Speaking of which, the coin item is useless and comes up too often. The biggest problem about this game however is the battle mode, it stinks! There aren’t even actual stages, instead just modified versions of some of the tracks.

I usually don't have friends to play with so usually I play solo and this is one of the few games in which I have a blast playing alone (lol). Single player is really fun even if you get bored of it, every once in a while is still fun. But the REAL highlight of the game is... the multiplayer. Multiplayer is as fun as ever, probably even better. Multiplayer is the same as ever: 4 player chaos in creative courses with mind-boggling items and newly made anti-gravity sections. Anti-gravity is as it sounds like, karts racing on walls and upside down, its not really a HUGE thing in my opinion but its a well made new and fresh idea. Online mode is a mode where you race aginst people Worldwide, Regionally, with Friends or in Tournaments. Worldwide is where you race with people around the world, Regionally is where I assume is where you race with people from your continent, with friends is with people you have played with randomly and people in your Friend List, and Tournaments is where you race with a set amount of rules and gain points to see in which place you landed.

nigelgrab,27-07-2014,"Mario Kart has successfully made itself feel brand new, more than any prior release in the series. The gameplay is familiar yet fresh and exciting, and the anti-gravity sections actually feel good - slightly more floaty and drifty than normal, but still a joy to control. The latter goes for all the gameplay - finding your style of play and a kart combination to match it is just awesome.
However, the replay value is actually fairly lacking, due to a disappointing battle mode that feels tacked on and empty, and no extra modes different to past entries. So pretty much once you complete every grand prix (and mirror mode if you're into that) you're left with nothing else worthwhile.
Despite that, where it hits the mark, Mario Kart 8 is an absolute joy to play, and is definitely worth getting a Wii U for.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Hakros323,22-11-2015,"This game is another must have for anyone who is one of the following:
Likes Mario
Likes racing games
Have a Wii U
Or all of the above.
Mario Kart 8 is one of the best games in the Mario Kart series, and heres why:
The graphics are AMAZING. It's absolutely breathtaking, and the littlest details were perfect. The retro courses and a beauty makeover too, and they look better than ever.
The courses are all awesome, fun, and unique. Its hard to choose a favorite! It does have the best Bowser Castle IMO, and while this Rainbow Road can be a bit lackluster compared to other rainbow roads, it's still good. The Retros courses were....eh....but I'm sure there's some courses that fans are happy to have back.
Like Mario Party 7, the online play for Mario kart 8 is great. Compete is races and battles with many players around the world. You can join online Tournaments and even make your own.
This game introduced the Anti-Gravity feature. With this feature, you can race virtually on any surface. Driving on walls and ceilings, this makes the race even more fun, and it's a interesting feature.
And customize your kart feature returned from Mario Kart 7. You can make your own unique kart combination.

There's a few flaws this game does suffer from, though. Namely, the Roster and Battle mode.
The roster, while way better than Mario Kart 7, still lacks some fan favorites like Bowser Jr., Diddy Kong, Boo, & Dry Bones. Although they did return Toadette and Waluigi. But the newcomers introduced are, well, bad. The Koopalings make their first playable apperance, which is good if you like them, but if you don't care about them, that 1/3 of the roster you're not going to like. There's a lot of baby characters in the game, all 4 babies from Mario Kart Wii returns along with Baby Rosalina. It's good if you like cute characters, but they're generally unwanted. Aaaand there's Pink Gold Peach, a character that NOONE wanted. So......roster still needs work.
And the battle mode? While is previous installments, you battle on courses made FOR battle mode, this installment, you battle on courses made for racing, with a few adjustments made. Not very creative.

But this is still a strong game for the Wii U. Get it if you have one.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

mvpeter24,05-07-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is a total anomaly.

On a system totally devoid of good games, MK8 shines. This is not just the best game on Wii U, but the best Mario Kart ever, and one of the most polished and fun Nintendo games ever made.

Mario Kart 7 tried to mix up the very well-tread Mario Kart formula by adding underwater and air-based sections to many courses. This installment continues that trend, keeping the air and water sections while adding anti-gravity sections into the mix. All the sudden courses that you could never imagine are a reality, as racers ride their karts all over the walls and ceilings.

But these changes in gameplay aren't even the thing that makes this the greatest Mario Kart yet. What really makes this game stand out are the new tracks. In previous games, I found it easy to pick out the 3-4 ""best tracks"" in the game. In this game, there is no such thing. It seems like every track is so unique, colorful, and carefully crafted that you could never make a list of the ""best."" Even the retro tracks are incredible. This game breathes new life into some of the best historical Mario Kart tracks, reimagining them in HD in ways you never even thought about when playing their 16-or-64 bit counterparts (I'm looking at you, Ribbon Road).

The visuals are probably the best on Wii U, showing off impressive realistic-looking lighting effects on courses that burst with color and charm. You never wanted any more out of a Mario Kart game, and it leaves you wondering if graphics can ever get better than what we have here.

The music in this game is unbelieveable. Nintendo started orchestrating their music with Super Mario Galaxy in 2007, but it took a long time for that shift to catch on in their other properties. 2008's Mario Kart Wii and 2011's Mario Kart 7 still featured MIDI-based music. This installment marks the first orchestrated Mario Kart game, and it sounds good. So good, in fact, you'll be dying to get the soundtrack.

In a world where DLC is treated like the devil, Nintendo has given us DLC in this game that any gamer would dream about. For $12, one can purchase an additional 16 tracks for the game, essentially boosting the total content of the game by 50%. These bonus packs keep up the quality that the other courses have, and are an absolute must-own.

If you made the mistake of buying a Wii U, this game is a must-have. Hell, this game was so much fun that you might consider buying a Wii U just to play it. Just be weary that this is about the only good game on the system.

The only part of the game that I'm disappointed with is the Battle-mode. It unfortunately uses the same maps that you race on, and Nintendo even misses its chance to make a ""Battle-Dome"" where you can drive up the wall, upside-down on the roof and etc. Vehicles in Battle-mode are also very slow, and are lacking any options to change this.

Jonhuggs,03-06-2014,"Awesome Game! I could never really get into the Wii Mario Kart because I didn't really like the motion controls, well problem solved. You can play with any controller for the Wii U be in the pro controller, gamepad, gamepad using motion controls, or wiimote(possibly classic controller, but I don't have one to test it out) and the controls are tight. The graphics are easily the best for the Wii U to date, with no lag or stuttering even online is butter smooth and connecting to an online mate is easy and fast. There are tons of unlockables through gameplay where other companies might charge you in app for. If you own a Wii U go get this game, if not go get a Wii U and This game with the price you can find the Wii U at these days it's almost a no brainer and you will not be disappointed.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Aerokii,01-06-2014,"This game takes a huge step forward in its course design and graphics, while lovingly looking back to its roots. It combines everything I've loved about every other Mario Kart, and turns it into a fresh experience. The new tracks are great, and the ""highlights"" are a nice touch- but the thing that most impresses me about this game are the retro courses. They're far from the standard copy/paste from the past, and each of them have been retrofitted with the new things this game brings, while still maintaining their original feel. Nintendo clearly put a lot of time, effort, and thought into this game, and it deserves every last cent that I've spent on it- and I haven't even STARTED The multiplayer yet!

niemand2014,05-06-2014,"Why Mario Kart 8 is the best of the Mario Kart series? Because it summes up the best of all previous titles, has high quality content (in terms of tracks, drivers, animations, ...) and most of all it has an improved game balancing!

Tracks
The 16 new tracks (plus the 16 remade maps, of cource) are amazing: Great Level Design, great Production Design, and each track has tons of unique visual content! One of my favorites is the one that reminds everyone of the Sugar Rush game in the Wreck-it-Ralph movie. Considering the rather low performance of the Wii U, Mario Kart 8 looks just beautiful: Textures, Shaders and Animations were made with passion definitely. Moreover, the gameplay of the new tracks are very much convincing, offering various challenges, shortcuts and game elements that are unique for each level, such as the Giant Bowser literally hitting the road in Bowsers' Castle.

Replay-Mode
What a great idea: After finishing a race, you can either see a replay of one of the drivers in full length, or configure parameters for a clip that the game will create automatically and that depicts some of the most interesting situations that occured. While playing the clip, you can pause, reward, forward AND slow down the playback. Especially the latter ends in VERY funny laughing fits when playing with friends. Seeing players get bashed, raging around with power-ups or having incredible comebacks in the last lap at slow motion is fun and a (meta-)gaming experience at its best!

Balancing
Finally! 1) Getting of the track (/the course), like by falling into the deep, doesn't make you go for the last place anymore. 2) Items now keep the balance between being too powerful and being too lame, still keeping enough space for surprises. 3) The racers nearly always drive in a quite narrow field, fostering the tension. But: You won't rotate from place 8 to place 2 to place 7 to place 1 all the time. Mario Kart 8 races always feel like very fair yet exciting, thrilling and surprising challenges. Finally!

Drivers and everything else
Just AWESOME.

There is still much more to write about this game, but it's simply not necessary, because nearly everything can be judged favourably. I would give it a 11 out of 10. Unfortunatelly, there are no distinct arena tracks for the good old multiplayer balloon battle (first known from Mario Kart 64). So let's say: 10 points.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MrTexasRanger,30-05-2014,"Phenomenal. Absolutely spectacular game. Exactly what I was hoping for from the 8th installment of the Mario Kart series. I was able to play through half the courses in one sitting, and the rest in another and ended very content with the results. The game looked amazing, ran like a joy, and had a great soundtrack (heavily influenced by the trumpet). I've yet to do too much focus on the multi-player as I am currently enjoying single player. Now as amazing as this game is, I do have merely 3 complaints as no game is truly perfect.

A. The zero-gravity/hover mode was visually impressive, but did not effect the aesthetics of the racing. You are still racing on a standard curvy track it just looks fancy. On that note the retro tracks could use a bit more zero-gravity.

B. Battle mode. If you've played this game, the title explains itself. They done-goofed the battle mode. The courses are no longer fun and interesting square arenas, but are portions of the courses itself. Completely shattered my nostalgia from battle mode.

C. Why all the mini bowser/bowser relatives? I don't have the character list in-front of me, but there are I want to say 6-7 bowser relative characters from the New Super Mario Bros series. These seem like wasted space as they easily could've included more characters from series' such as Super Mario Galaxy/Sunshine.

That's it for the negative. Those are really minor complaints in the grand scheme of things as overall, this is the most I've enjoyed myself in a video game in quite some time. I can't help but smile and let the nostalgia overflow me as I play this nearly perfect installation in one of my all-time favorite series'.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Gameplay is classic Mario Kart, but with a couple new items and elements that always keeps things interesting and on your toes. The level designs are almost awe-inspiring on a visual level and a whole lotta fun. If there is ANYTHING keeping me from giving this a perfect 10, it'd be the fact that the current character roster is saturated with Baby versions of characters already there. It make the selection of characters feel...lacking, and not really diverse. But that's a nitpicky issue, as they are all balanced better than ever before. For those on the fence for buying a Wii U, this is absolutely worth the ticket price. The engine is efficient (60 FPS for 1-2 players local and single-player) and looks as good, if not better than, most next-gen games currently available. It's also more fun than ANY Xbox One or PS4 game out now, and the best part is it'll keep on giving for years to come, especially with the strong possibility of DLC in the coming future.

Pros: The visuals. Wow. It looks amazing. The races. The Characters. Multiplayer etc.
Cons: The battle mode. This is the thing that held it back from a 10. They put actual race tracks in the game instead of those cube tracks. This results to instead battling it out with your friends, you drive through the track hoping you find them. And even you do find them, they're just gonna zoom past you.

eirikwatz,08-06-2014,"Striking colors, fantastic music and unabashed fun, that is whats waiting for you in Mariokart 8.

Mariokart 8 is fantastic game showing that a series in its 8th installment can still come up with fresh ideas and deliver such a high dosage of pure gaming joy. in a time where the trend to bash on Nintendo for being ""unoriginal"" and ""behind the times"" its refreshing to see a game without the mountains of blood, gore and excessive dlc and microtrnsactions from a AAA publisher.

Let's pretend you have never played a game in the mariokart series. What does it play like? well mariokart (and almost every kart racer) builds upon the idea of crazy physics and over the top tracks that you duke it out on, often with some sort of item/weapon system. strategic use of items and Mastering of inline drifting is top priority.

while the same basic concept remains the same for mariokart 8, it's still the most refreshing kart game i have played in years. The antigravity feature may not seem to be much of a change at first, but its how much it plays in with gliding and underwater portins that makes it all work together. while mariokart 7 also had the gliding and underwater sections, it never really meshed. But with the antigravity in mariokart 8 it manages to transition seamlessly from one to the other without it feeling like thoughtless addon.

aside from thye new features what improvement does this 8th installment in this gaming megaseries bring to the table? for me it was the changes made to how items and drifting work. in past mariokart games you had the ability to pick up an item, shield you back with it and pick up another item in your hand, ready to blast anyone brave enough to slip past your defenses. This made first place almost invincible and impervious to attacks. not this time though as you can only pick up one item at a time, leveling the playing field. but as a consolation for the nefarious shell and banana fortresses they have the superhorn, an item so glorious, so magnificent it shattered the mind of many a mariokart fan, sending tears of gratitude from battle worn eyes. This item is able block the dreaded blue spine shell. halleluja!

As mentioned earlier the other major improvement to this game lies the improvemt made the drifting system, the bikes in particular. in previous installments bikes had the ability to inline drift, makeing them superior to karts in every way. this is fixed in mariokart 8 by giving every new vehicle type its own advantagea and weaknesses. bikes have better drifting, ATV's have better traction rough terrain and recover faster from slipping of the course into mud or grass. regular karts have better overall stats on every field and have an advantage when racing straight ahead on regular asphalt. of course each character also brings their own stats and preferences for vehicles. this makes this the most ballanced mariokart to date. cpu's are still terminators hunting the player down though.

the graphics in mariokart 8 is some of the best graphics i have ver seen in a video game eve. no its not the most technicaly advanced graphics ever seen, but its still gorgeous and proves the wiiu is no slouch when compared to the ps4 and xb1. the creativity that is put into the design of each track, both graphicaly and from a gameplay standpoint is mindblowing. even the the retro courses have been remade with new features and gorgeous HD visuals.

the online is probably the best nintendo has ever had, you can customize EVERYTHING in the different modes, from item selection to tournament rules and times. i ahve experienced no lag or dropping and have not had any conectivity issues over my long play sessions of this game.

there is only one issue i have with this game and that is a big one for some people. they completely ruines the battle mode. no more custom made arenas designed for crazy deathmatches and high intensity weapon slinging. instead you batle it out on the tracks from racing mode. this makes battle kode slow and tedious and completely unplayable with less than 12 characters. once the player count dips below it becomes more of a match of finding someone in an empty nothingness compared to the chaotic fun of previous battle modes.

all in all this is a fantastic game and a testament to nintendo's creativity and skill in game design, showing us why they still reign when it comes to making an actaully fun game and not barely interactive ""cinematic experiences"" that is so popular today. if not for the lackluster battle mode this would have gotten a 10 out of 10, but it seems nothing can reach perfection. a stellar game worth every buck for years to come. a definite BUY.

It gets an 9/10 from me for two reasons:
1 - The character selection is a bit lackluster. How about Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr., Dry Bones, Boo, Birdo, ROB, etc.?
2 - Battle mode is pretty much just racing mode that doesn't end until you get hit 3 times. It's terrible compared to other iterations of Battle Mode in Mario Kart, which used to be lots of fun.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

IntelligntGamer,30-05-2014,"I could write this review using a single word.

Fantastic.

But it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't describe the colossal amount of effort Nintendo has gone to to make Mario Kart 8 the prettiest game on Wii U, even prettier than Super Mario 3D World, the prior graphical showcase Wii U owners like me would use to show off what the console could really do if people just tried. From the character models to the fact that this game runs in 60 frames per second, even in split screen two player, Mario Kart 8 is now the go-to-game to show people that Wii U can rival even the PS4 when it comes to graphical prowess. The fact that this came out the same week as Watch Dogs, which looks last gen even on the PS4, makes this all the sweeter.

It wouldn't be enough to tell you about the little graphical flourishes Nintendo have sprinkled throughout the world, so little that you don’t really notice them but they help bring the world to life. Things like Donkey Kong’s fur or Mario’s mustache rustling in the wind as their kart zooms around the track. The little background animations that don’t need to be there but are. The word “fantastic” would encompass these things, surely, but wouldn't tell you how impressive it is in its subtlety.

It wouldn't let you know that the racing controls in this game are spot-freaking-on, just as they have been in every Mario Kart since the halcyon days of the N64.

“Fantastic” wouldn’t explain how great the music is, from the synthesized beats of the Electrodome to the orchestral music of Cloudtop Cruise.

Nor would it be enough to tell you how easy the online matchmaking is, putting more “adult” games like Titanfall to shame. Or how well online multiplayer runs. Or just how fun it is.

Fantastic wouldn’t tell you where Mario Kart 8 stumbles, either. The most obvious stumble is Battle Mode, a multiplayer favorite since the original Mario Kart came out on the SNES. Whereas previous iterations of Battle Mode had custom built arenas, here Battle Mode is reduced to reconfigured versions of the Grand Prix mode tracks. It’s such an obvious fumble that you wonder why Nintendo even bothered to include Battle Mode if they were going to half-arse it like this.

There’s also the use of the Gamepad; in the sense that apart from being a horn or being the usual avenue for off-TV play, it’s not really utilised as well as it could be. How about a reverse camera option, so you can always see what’s happening behind you? What about a local 2 player mode that allows one player to play on the TV and the other on the Gamepad? Great ideas that aren’t there for some reason.

Mario Kart 8 may also prove the adage that you can have too much of a good thing. Some criticized Mario Kart 7 on the 3DS of having too few characters, but here there may be too many. Choice is always nice, but the fact that there are five different baby characters, and six of the Koopalings, makes the character choice seem a bit superfluous. There are differences between all the characters, of course, but when the differences are so subtle because of the large variety of characters to chose from, you end up wishing for less.

There’s the consistent problem of the enemy AI being all knowing. I’ve always seen single player Mario Kart as Me vs. 8+ computer characters working as one. This problem becomes all the more obvious when you start making it to the front of the pack. For example, Mario Kart veterans know that the only time you get items like the Blue Shell, or the Lightning Bolt, are when you’re at the back of the pack. When you’re all the way back there, you can’t really know what’s going on in first. So it’s insane that when you’re leading the race, and about to jump over a precarious jump, that a Lightning Bolt hits you at just the right time to see you spin out and fall to your doom. There’s no other word for that than unfair; fantastic is definitely not apropos.

A minor niggle I have… and it’s really minor… is the fact that the default menu choice following a race is the Replay button. If you’re anything like me, you’re constantly hitting A trying to speed up your progression to the next race. Mario Kart 8 looks set to break me of that habit, since starting a replay of the race just ends up slowing me down. The replay feature is a nice feature, don’t get me wrong; the ability to edit and share videos on Youtube and Miiverse is especially cool. But it’s not the main game.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is fantastic. Just fantastic. It’s pure fun. The new anti-grav feature is arguably a gimmick, but when it bends your mind (and the course) it’s just, well, fantastic fun. Mario Kart 8 stumbles in a few places, but the overall package is one of quality and substance. It’s a game all Wii U owners should be buying right now, and it’s a game that should make non-Wii U owners rush out and buy the console right now.

Fantastic. Get it now.

Bellachichi,31-05-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is my favorite game in the franchise. This game is an absolute blast at every turn. The 16 new courses are gorgeous, and the 16 remastered courses are all changed enough to make it feel like a brand new experience, with just the right amount of nostalgia. Online play so far has been working flawlessly, and new games start in less than a minute.

My only gripes is the character roster and the battle mode. The roster is filled with babies, koopalings, and metal characters. Which are okay, but when these characters take up the space of fan favorites like Dry Bones, Boo, and Birdo, I start to think that maybe we don't need 5 baby characters. And the battle mode is significantly different, now taking place on actual tracks from the game instead of in a fixed arena. It's difficult to catch people when you either have to tail behind them, or they zip past you going the opposite way.

These issues are easy to look past, as the core gameplay and track design is better than it has ever been. This game is pure unadulterated fun, and is definitely worth your time as a Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

TheMitch,07-06-2014,"Here's the thing. Nintendo have this gift; a gift of magical prowess. They know how to make games that attract all kinds of people, no matter their personality. It's a gift that is so rare nowadays, yet never goes under-appreciated. Mario Kart 8 is the prime example of this. It delivers with such poise that it makes you wonder if the Wii U was ever on struggle street. Titles like Mario Kart 8 are what bring supposedly doomed consoles back to life. Every game has its issues, and Mario Kart 8 is no exception. But when the magic of Nintendo shines through, there isn't anything that makes you feel let down. For over 30 years, Nintendo have been the kings of game development, and Mario Kart 8 shines brightly with every other classic gem they've ever made. Kudos to you, Nintendo. Pats on back for a job well done.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Well, I do have minor complaints with the game (notably the bizarre roster, the battle mode, and the online infrastructure, etc.), they're truly minuscule in face of the amazing and seemingly endless content that this game provides.

kayymoneyy,30-05-2014,"It's always a god feeling when a console gets a timeless classic of a game like Mario Kart 8 is. This game adds to an already great, underrated lineup of games for the Wii U. The first thing I noticed when I threw the game in was the graphics. Finally, an HD version of a Mario Kart series that easily gets a spot in my top 10 all time greatest game series. The courses are beautiful and you find yourself admiring just how good everything looks mid-race. The critics definitely nailed the key point here, the fact that you're getting everything you loved from past games in the series while giving you more features like customization and a couple new power ups. This is the first in the series where, in my observation, can be master of the controls in the former Mario Karts but will have a bit of a learning curve with this installment. You have to be a bit more careful on the turns when first starting up, but if you recently polished your skills with one of the older Mario Karts, you'll catch on by your 2nd or 3rd cup qualifier.

The anti-gravity elements are in my opinion not emphasized enough in gameplay, say when go upside down your camera realigns with the track so it looks like your driving normally so it's more like a underlining concept to keep the series and action ticking.

PolisKanin,07-06-2014,"Fun enjoyable gameplay. This is my favourite Mario Kart yet (previously it was Mario Kart 64). The gameplay is enjoyable alone, but best played with friends or being competitive online. The only flaws are the poor roster (full of babies, metal mario and the aweful pink gold peach) and in battle mode you can only play on race courses rather than courses specifically designed for it like previous installments in the series. This leads to you driving around trying to find someone for the whole match, and when you do it's someone on your team, but you're so happy that you have found someone so you throw an item anyway, but it harms them as items aren't on team. However, battle mode isn't the main feature in Mario Kart, and the roster can be forgiven by the fact you can play as Mii, which have almost endless customization possibilities.

I thought for sure I was going to have to sell my Wii U but this game really turned it around for me. The game itself is standard Mario Kart, with a small twist ""anti gravity"" while this didn't really break any grounds for me it was a cool feature and was a lot better alternative then flying as they had in sonic racing. The drift system is pretty cool I wish they would have added a 3rd boost option for drifting vs the 2 stages that currently exist. I have unlocked just about anything the ghosts were not too difficult to beat it was more of a ""showing you all possible paths in a given course"". I still have not accomplished 3 stars on all 150 cc mirror events but have completed regular 150cc and the rubber banding can be pretty ridiculous at times, but RNG is RNG. The online play is smooth for me I have not seen much lag or any kind of frustrating mechanics beyond the normal MK8 experience. I'm still waiting to get the 10k coins to unlock the last item. Overall the game is great! Fun with friends or with strangers and even with some of the same annoying mechanics regarding the rubber band feature its definitely not as strict as it's previous Wii release.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

dmelendez34,24-06-2014,"If battle mode was better, this game would get a 10 from me. Not having special battle mode areas was the worst idea Nintendo had. I would have preferred they simply reused the areas from past games at least than having players race around tracks.

The tracks are great = the new ones are beautiful and creative and the old ones are touched up to make them more enjoyable.

Gotohellcadz,16-06-2014,"A solid game offering a fantastic graphics and controls. It's only shortcoming come from the butchered battle mode and last lustre multiplayer features and awkward roster additions/changes. As while the multiplayer in it has evolved and lost the majority of it's networking issues what happened to the community system from mk7? It worked great and they had every opportunity to work on that but instead we're left with a tournament feature which while it does work for setting up game tournaments it doesn't for managing your community of players for game nights on the clock. I did also have a few nit picks with the item system this time around as while I'm glad they nerfed blue shells into the ground item pickups across different race placings is broken (5th place gets a bullet bill, 8th get's a single banana) focusing more on defensive drops rather than mario kart's previous offense with the majority of drops being shells. My last issue is that they removed a lot of the fan classic characters and tracks. We only get one snes track (donut plains 3) which is terrible when considering the other snes tracks and the retro and new tracks as a whole don't have many standouts. But you probably know all the pros with the game, like amazing graphics tight control etc. If you own a wii u this is a must buy.

DestinationMarc,30-06-2014,"I really enjoyed this game! Now, it does have its issues, but first, what's good about it; the controls are nearly similar to Mario Kart Wii, and while I was worried about this, the underwater/parasail segments from Mario Kart 7 were actually easilly controllable. The visuals? Amazing. It is SO enjoyable playing a Mario Kart game in beautiful HD! The new items were cool, though I personally find the fireball item a bit useless; maybe it's just me, but unless you have good aim or just get lucky, it's pretty difficult to hit opponents with it. The new levels are just GLORIOUS; Electrodrome is my personal favorite track! I'd also like to mention that the online functionality is WAY more improved from MKWii's; I love the tournament option personally! The anti-gravity is a cool feature, but honestly, though not to this degree, I've seen the concept before in another racing game, Crash Nitro Kart, sideways tires and all! Now, on to the bad; first and foremost, the battle mode. Everyone's said this already, and my opinion's no exception, but I think it was a bad idea to implement actual racetracks as battle courses instead of arenas. Secondly, when you're first place in a race, you'll usually get coins as items, which can be real frustrating, especially when you're trying to defend yourself. Also, Rainbow Road? Not exactly a challenge, which is considered a nitpick, but c'mon; everyone knows Rainbow Road is the craziest course in any Mario Kart game! So, all-in-all, while I'd like to give this game a 10, personally, those major issues do hold the game back a bit.

cwepahguy225,05-07-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is awesome. The course design is great and creative. The character roster is the biggest yet, and has the Koopalings as playable characters (for the first time ever). However, there are too many baby characters (and what about Birdo, Diddy, Hammer Bro, and Dry Bones)? Even though anti gravity doesnt bring any massive changes, it's still fun and I love it. It was like ""the glue that connected hang gliding and underwater racing"". Gamexplain said that. The tracks are incredibly detailed, making the game more like the real world. The music and graphics are both stunning. The game does have some cons though. You can't carry a backup item anymore, which sucks. Also, first place gets less items. The big downside is battle mode. Battle mode is ruined. It uses slightly modified courses instead of arenas. Also, the cpus are way too good, there aim w/ green shells is perfect. They need to be nerfed.

The online mode offers great competition and excellent replay value. Now for the downside, some tracks look muggy and there's an unnecessary use of the anti gravity in some tracks.

frogvsmosquito,12-09-2014,"Before I got Mario Kart 8, the only experience i had with Mario Kart was playing it on my friend's DS. And that previous experience was positive. This, however, is even better. It's all I remember from the DS game and a lot more.
The first thing you'll notice when you start racing is the antigravity. Antigravity sections work differently than the others. Colliding into your opponents would normally be a bad idea, but in antigravity when you collide into an opponent, you'll both get a little speed boost, so use it wisely to get ahead!
The game has 32 tracks (16 new and 16 retro). Tracks have so much variety. On one track you'll find yourself in a world made out of sweets, on the other you'll be racing through pipes avoiding Piranha Plants, on the other one you'll be on a big floating track above the city, you name it! And with the new DLC coming, which will add 16 more tracks, expect to be racing through Hyrule!
Online multiplayer is one of the best I've seen. Didn't. Crash. Once. And the feeling when you finish first, ahead of experts... it's so satisfying. You can also either participate in tournaments, or you can create your own for others to compete in. Rule settings are pretty detailed such as race class, time when tournament begins/ends, number of races... You can also bring a friend to play online with you in the same room! Oh the laughs, rages, ups and downs...
The only thing I don't like is the battle mode. The goal is to pop other player's balloons. This time, instead of specially designed battle arenas, you'll be battling on one of the 8 selected tracks. It can take a while for someone to pass so you can pop the opponent's balloon. Or you can hide behind a rock or something and wait for some clueless Mushroom kingdom resident to pass and pop his balloons. Hehehe...
Overall, very good game that you should own if you have a Wii U.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Forbod,22-09-2014,"While i'm a huge fan of most Nintendo games I have to say that Mariokart 8 was a bit of a let down. Don't let the massive hype and undying fan-dom of people fool you into thinking that all Nintendo games are super fantastic perfect games. While Mariokart 8 sported great graphics and fun gameplay. It did however lack in the character department sporting many unpopular Bowser spawns and baby versions of characters. But what really destroyed my love for this game is the realization that the game purposefully punishes winners and rewards losers during a race via the power up system. Whereas if you are holding 1st place you have a 90% chance of receiving just coins (Even if you have your max 10/10 coins) from the power-up cubes and a 0% chance of getting any strong power ups. The best you may receive is a single mushroom boost or a green shell but those are very very rare. This leaves anyone trying to hold 1st at a huge disadvantage and completely defenseless and usually easily beat at the last stretch of the race unless the person in 1st is a extremely far ahead.

All and all I kinda regret paying 60 bucks for this game and the only real fun i get from is it playing with friends locally.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

pxsh,21-08-2015,"Great game overall, fantastic singleplayer experience, run in smooth 60 fps which is a major upgrade from the older series. Lots of tracks and a decent AI that does not seem to cheat too much, as the old MK games did. The Game lacks a proper Battle mode and it's a shame and disgrace towards all fans of the series to skip this in favor for a""new and innovative"" battle mode, which demonstrably have been proven quite boring by too many players, including me. A question for Nintendo, where is the classic battle map DLC or any hints regarding a possibility ? The 7 out of 10 score from me is due to the great singleplayer experience. Don't buy this and expect some great multiplayer experience like in the former games in the series.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
MEFzelder,09-05-2016,"Desde ""Mario Kart 64"" no encontraba un juego de carreras que me atrapara tanto, esta nueva versión tiene una manejo muy suave y responsable que hace que sea fácil de aprender y dominar, sin mencionar el detalle puesto en cada pista haciendo que cada escenario sea entretenido y vistoso.
""Mario Kart 8"" es uno de los juegos que mejor cumplió en cuanto a ejecución, a pesar de que la Wii U no sea tan potente como sus rivales generacionales el juego se reproduce en unos fluidos 60 frames por segundo, y solo se reduce a 40 cuando son 4 las personas que estan jugando en simultaneo. El juego utiliza la fórmula de siempre carrera de kartings con items con diferentes funciones que hacen que la carrera sea competitiva y cambiante en cada momento, con la incorporación de 32 pistas, de las cuales 16 son remakes de pistas de versiones anteriores.
Uno de los puntos fuertes de esta versión es la diversidad para construir tu competidor ideal, no solo puedes balancear el vehículo a tu gusto sino que se agregaron dos pesos a los tradicionales corredores livianos, medios y pesados, sumando peso pluma y muy pesados. Otra mecánica es la secciones de 0 gravedad donde el vehículo anda de cabeza pero debido a que la cámara te sigue siempre detrás y con la misma perspectiva no me produce ninguna diferencia con ir sobre tierra.
El punto más débil del juego es el modo batalla, debido a que no hay niveles planeados para este modo, se reutilizan las pistas de carreras generando situaciones muy aburridas para atacarte con items porque es muy difícil coincidir con tus rivales, este modo es totalmente olvidable.
A pesar de lo malo del modo batalla este juego es un ""Must have"", es de lo mejor en cuanto a jugabilidad y gráficamente, ideal para competir en línea o local con amigos.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Mikeylano,02-06-2014,"Most reviews fail to point out any of MK8's flaws. I shall attempt to do so. Nevertheless, I bought the Wii U specifically for this game and I am glad I did. It is a masterpiece, but it is not perfect.

Everything is great, except for:

- Ability to hold a weapon in reserve: Now you can only hold one item at a time. You cannot hold, for example, a banana behind you for defence whilst hitting an item box to get something else in reserve. This feature was removed unnecessarily. Now, if you are in 1st, you simply hold on to whatever defensive item you get, rather than attempting to sabotage 2nd place (in fear that you may get a coin). This makes the game significantly less tactical.

- No on-screen map: whilst there is a map on the game pad, it is not as practical as having one at a glance on the television screen. It also makes playing with a Pro Controller more difficult. Checking whether and who is fast approaching is now not as easy unless you pause the game, lift the pad up and try to retain concentration or use the rear view mirror, which may only give you a brief snapshot of what is going on behind. This pales in usefulness to a full map which shows you the precise location of everyone (including those ahead) in an instant.

- No quick way to compare vehicles and parts: There should be a compare button that allows you to select one vehicle/part and track the bars of others against it. The only practical way to compare is looking up an online table.

- Online track voting: no longer can you select any of the tracks. You are given a selection of four tracks, or can simply opt for any random course. This is a step backwards.

- Awful battle mode: I am alarmed at how bad this is. There are no arenas - you just race around (a select few of) the normal tracks firing at each other. This is so bad that it makes you wonder whether the game was rushed.

- No horizontal two-player split screen: the only available mode is vertical. This makes it very difficult to see around sharp corners in advance, and caters for the few times that the camera deviates slightly on the diagonal. Give players the option at least.

- Character selection: too many babies and repeats. You can play as three types of Mario and Peach. The Koopalings are a nice addition but at the expense of great characters like Diddy Kong. Why is ""Pink Gold Peach"" more iconic than Diddy, Dixie or King Boo?

- ""View replay"" is default selection after race: by default, ""next race"" should be selected, not view replay. This gets frustrating when you just want to get to the next race but through 20 years of habit press A only to be presented with the replay screen.

- AI: unfortunately the AI seems to cheat quite a lot. Thankfully, now that online is the centrepiece, this does not matter so much. You can really tell the difference in challenge when you play against the AI and then online. The AI has faultless accuracy for items like green shells and the boomerang, and seems to get the perfect item to ruin your race at just the right time. Expect bloopers on the last section of Grumble Volcano and blue shells in the last 20 seconds of a race when you are winning (this usually happens at least once every grand prix).

- Weapon distribution: Weapons from 1st to 6th place are invariably on the weak side. Mushrooms, coins and single bananas/shells are very common. Things only get interesting in the lower half of the pack, unless you race on frantic mode. In past MK games, 3rd place and below usually netted you something more powerful, such as triple red shells. However, even at the back of the pack, it is still entirely possible to get weak items, whilst those in the middle get high powered ones. This is very bizarre.

-Effect of coins: I think the return of coins is a great idea, but they are so important that driving skill is less important than whether you have 10 coins or not. The problem is that when you get hit or fall off, you lose three coins. This means that people in the middle of the pack are less likely to ever catch up with first place because they are constantly battling it out between each other and slowing each other down. In my experience, most races have one person far out in front and an explosive pack of people in 3rd - 10th that is anyone's game.

- Retro track selection. Personally I think there are too many tracks from the handheld games, although all of them are done well. However, I think Toad's Turnpike should NOT have included anti gravity elements, because this means that the main focus of the track - bustling amongst the traffic - is lost.

This may seem like a lot of criticism, but overall it still means that MK8 is a great game. All the tracks are enjoyable to play (although I don't think any of them are spectacular), the music is great and the racing itself is very smooth. The way the blue shell works (back to N64 days) is very welcome. No doubt I will be playing it for many years to come, hopefully with patches.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
emwick81,27-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 would have been much more enjoyable had it allowed arenas for battle mode. I long for the battle mode days of the SNES. It is nearly impossible to track down one's opponents in the race track battle mode environment of Mario Kart 8. Nintendo, please correct this!! Otherwise, this will be the last Mario Kart that I buy. Thanks for your consideration.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Celever,08-06-2014,"In a game series such as Mario Kart, breaking the bar and delivering a truly fantastic addition to the series is far more difficult than one would first think. Mario Kart 8 is overall a great game and is a lot of fun to play, however there are several design choices which I highly disagree with. The most noticeable is, of course, there being no map on your television screen. Looking down to your gamepad for a map is also very detrimental to your race, and having to do so will hinder more than help. This was especially noticeable in battle mode, where a map is more necessary than ever as you try to navigate full-sized tracks in order to find another player.
Another less noticeable design choice was that after a race in a Grand Prix or Versus race cup, you cannot merely mash the ""A"" or ""2"" button to move on to the next course. This is because they placed ""View Highlight Reel"" above ""Next Race"" or ""View Results"" in the menu, which has made me have to view the replays unnecessarily. Especially because, let's be honest here, very few people view replays of their races. This leads on to another complaint I have; it feels as if the development team hasn't tried to refine the game properly, and spent their time on unnecessary features such as Mario Kart TV, which is essentially a primeval version of the ""Mario Kart Channel"" we saw back in 2007 for Mario Kart Wii. A couple of noticeable cases of not refining the game properly is the lack of a stopwatch, and having the scores added or subtracted to your ratings disappearing after a short amount of time.
The game is also unfortunately easy. The whole point of Mario Kart is to be hectic, exciting and a fun multi-player experience. This game seems to be more like a generic racing game the likes you would find on other consoles. The Special Cup had me falling off of it a total of 2 times my first time playing this game (which was 150cc) when I truly didn't know the tracks. Both ""Rainbow Road"" tracks have too many walls for a finale, and other, actually quite hectic tracks such as Cloudtop Cruise or even the very first Mario Kart Stadium are pretty much lined with walls the whole way through. However, one of those examples is from the Mushroom Cup and the other from the Special Cup. This game has no difficulty curve! This is especially apparent when DK Jungle, from Mario Kart 7's Special Cup, appears in the Banana Cup of all things. Arguably the hardest new track in the game, Mount Wario, is in the Star Cup, not the Special... I could go on.
However, one must give credit where credit is due. It is likely that all of the retro tracks have had to have been made from scratch, as many redesigned parts have been placed in the tracks, along with all textures now being HD. Unfortunately, I prefer the retro tracks to the new tracks almost unanimously, but there are a few new courses which I think are going to be all-time favourites for me, such as Cloud Top Cruise. The Anti-Gravity is an incredibly fun feature, and it seems quite chaotic whilst driving through them in a pack. However, there are times where it seems quite tacked on (such as in Wario Stadium). In a franchise like Mario Kart, you have such high expectations to have to try and live up to it is no wonder this game isn't quite as good as others in the series. However, this is the worst game in the franchise, but it is still quite close.
However, this doesn't stop it being an incredibly fun game, and while it doesn't appeal to me, I'm sure it appeals to many other players. It looks gorgeous, as has been stated repeatedly over the Internet, but graphics alone don't make a game. Not once have I had a sudden urge to play Mario Kart 8 since buying the game. However, this is because the game doesn't appeal to me because what I see in a Mario Kart game is a short burst of fun-filled adrenaline with items and constant shifting of the places. What I see in Mario Kart 8 is a serious racing game the likes of the Dirt series featured on other consoles.

In short, if you want a serious racing game, I would buy Dirt 3 and an Xbox 360 over the far more expensive Mario Kart 8 and Wii U. If you want a fun and hectic Mario Kart game, a Nintendo GameCube (or Wii!) and Mario Kart: Double Dash!! would be the better option for you, along with Mario Kart 7 and Mario Kart Wii in that order. If you already have a Wii U, then Mario Kart 8 is a very worthwhile game to pick up in the shallow game library the system has.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Aayph,03-06-2014,"I'm a bit disappointed by most of the reviews here, especially the 10 point reviews.
Many praising for the good old Mario Kart in HD, the sales bringer for the Wii U.
As hardcore Nintendo / Mario fan it seems you are not allowed anymore to note something negative, otherwise you might be a hater...

But let us face it straight - As Hardcore Mario Kart gamer it's letting me down.
Of course the game has many good points and it's still an excellent game, but if you played Double Dash, or the Wii version and you played it really hardcore you will find many difference in the Balancing of the game which will annoy you.

Lets start with the positive:
-> Best Graphics in a Mario Kart game so far
-> New Type of Vehicle, Quads
-> You can build your vehicle as you like (comp. to Wii)
-> Wonderful track design

Points that are neutral, mostly depends on personal taste:
-> New Items - There are good and bad additions
-> Character Selection - Some nice characters have removed, some have been added
-> Wheelies have been removed (comp. to Wii)
-> Item rates depending on place have been greatly change, less different items for first places etc.
-> Redesign of old tracks (+because it's not just a copy, -because they have become less interesting)

Negative things:
-> You can now only hold 1 items, removes strategy aspect from the game
-> Tracks are easy to master, it requires not much skill anymore to drive good times
-> Game became more luck based because of the new balancing

For me the races do not feel that intense anymore as on the Wii, I've the feeling I've less control over what happens with me. It was always the case you could have a good or a bad phase, you could easily drop to the last place or with luck having a comeback and win the race from last place.
In Mario Kart 8 it seems more usual that you drop a lot places, then gain a lot places again etc. the field is more tight together, but this does not mean it makes more interesting, it makes it just more annoying.

In my opinion the game has become even more casual than it already was, so for people playing from time to time, families and Kids it's great. But for people who also wanted to drive for competition need to look for a new game.

Actually subjective I would give it rather 4-5 Points, but from objective view it's more 7 - 7,5 points.

I as Nintendo fan boy and Mario Lover hope the next game becomes more intense again, but Mario Kart has lost the status for me as 'must buy game'.

Jecht_342,03-06-2014,"The first thing you'll notice about this game is that it's beautiful. I've liked the look of past Mario Kart games, but this one is beyond compare. Even the remade maps from past systems look amazing. The second important thing about it is that they've made some new innovations, and they all work pretty well. Driving underwater and on walls and gliding are all fun mechanics that are similar enough to fit in, but different enough to make the game seem fresh.
Overall, I would say this is the best Mario Kart game I've ever played.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
TaraDarveaux,05-06-2014,"Most exciting Mario Kart game yet. New items are awesome, and maps are gorgeous. Even the online play is extremely improved. The only thing I thought was weird is that green shells seem easier to actually hit people with, maybe I'm just getting better at playing though. Oh, and when you fall off the track there isn't an obnoxious black screen that makes it seem like you just got put to 12th place.

Rikkaiser,11-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a step backwards for the Mario Kart franchise. It's getting a lot of positive attention, as you would expect a Mario Kart game to get. I think people are beginning to disregard any flaws that a Mario Kart game may have now because of a delusion that all of these games are perfect. If this is your first time picking up a Mario Kart game, I would recommend Mario Kart Wii over this game, if you already have a Wii or Wii U. So why don't I like Mario Kart 8? They changed things that didn't need to be changed. It felt like they took content out. They added things that didn't need to be added. And worst of all, it feels like it was lazy. I'll get the positive things out of the way now, because I'd like to put more emphasis on the negative aspects. The game is fun, as usual. The game is gorgeous, too. The graphics are very nice to look at, the music sounds pretty good. They added a Piranha Plant power-up, which I thought was a strong and good addition- it chomps every few seconds, giving you a small boost each time and grabbing/attacking anything on your screen (even the Blooper that sprays ink). They also added a Music Box power-up, which was an excellent addition because it sends out a shock wave around the user, flipping any nearby enemy drivers and destroying any incoming hostile projectiles (including the Blue Shell) or any bad things left on the road. It's a power-up that requires skill and timing, and there can never be enough of that. Online mode is pretty smooth, I've never lagged and I've never had any problems finding people or connecting. Bikes were also made more similar to karts, which, while it takes away some of the uniqueness of bikes, adds a bit more balance to the game. The game also lets you take on the Grand Prix with your friends, something that should have been added a long time ago. That's it for the good. Time for the bad. And there's a lot more of it. When I first started the game, the first thing I did was look up a list of specific prerequisites to unlock characters (sorry, I didn't feel like finding out for myself), and the characters themselves. When I found something to read, it told me that all the characters are unlocked in a random order. That's stupid. In Mario Kart Wii, there was the more difficult-to-get Dry Bowser, who seemed awesome. And you know how you unlock him? By getting a one star rating or higher on all the new 150cc cups. Not too difficult, but was definitely satisfying to complete that specific goal and have that character waiting for you as a reward. Dry Bowser is just my favorite example- there are plenty of other characters that were unlocked in many different unique and specific ways. Mario Kart 8, however, has the universal method of coming in 1st place in any cup, unlocking one character per gold trophy. So you can't just go for the characters you want by taking on specific challenges- you just play and hope the game gives you the character you want (if there are even any on MK8's roster). My experience works out perfectly for this review- the only character I wanted was the last one I unlocked. That was real nice. Oh, and yeah, I only cared about one- Rosalina. The rest of the roster was garbage. They used all 7 Koopaling bosses from the original Super Mario World. While I was amazed and happy at first, realizing that they put ALL SEVEN of them in the game ruined any kind of excitement and nostalgia I felt. That was a lazy choice. And in case there weren't enough babies, Baby Rosalina joined the fray! Because, you know, we need more of the same exact character. Metal Mario is kinda cool I guess. Lakitu is okay, I love Rosalina, and the heavy/metal versions of Mario and Peach were fine. But, in my opinion, the rest of the roster was lame and lazy. 2-player split screen was made worse. The screen is now divided with a vertical line instead of a horizontal one, making your vision of what you actually need to see worse. Battle Mode was butchered. This one was painful. Remember those fun, arena-like tracks where you could have balloon battles in a frenzy? They're gone. The new selection of courses to battle on are just a few of the actual racetracks from the game. This was one of the stupidest decisions they made. They added some power-ups that are horrible. There's a Coin as a power-up now. It gives you a barely noticeable speed boost and two coins. Useless. There's also a Boomerang, which is seemingly impossible to aim. The ""8"" is stupid too, because it consists of 7 mediocre power-ups and a Star. But you have hardly any control what order they're used in, so I just mash the button until I get the Star. If you hold a power-up behind/around you now, like a banana peel, it doesn't empty your item slot. This takes away strategy from the game. Finally, the new anti-gravity mechanic is practically unnoticeable. I'm sorry to end it so abruptly, and I had more to say, but I'm reaching the character limit. Mario Kart 8 is a disappointment to the franchise",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Hardycore,31-05-2014,"Having read some of the reviews, I can't understand why people rate this game so high. Of course everyone has their own opinion, but I'm not that fond of it.

Let's start with the good stuff.
The game looks gorgeous. That, coming from someone who doesn't care about the graphics much, that means a lot. The soundtrack is nice too. It is very fitting.

What this game is lacking, however, is skill to master it. It is a nice and very fun game for any casual gamer and even my friend who is really bad at games in general, liked it.

But that's just it. It's easy and simple. There isn't much to be good at.

I'm not saying it doesn't take skill at all. It matters where you drive and there are several ways to take shortcuts. There are also several ways to increase speed. However, most tricks, if not all, you'll learn your first day.

The courses have gotten somewhat easier, the AI worse and items aren't as devastating as they used to be (which is a good thing). Having played mainly mario kart double dash, I have to say it has gotten worse instead of better. In double dash, you had to push enemies around and picking characters actually mattered. Each character had their own unique item, and that was certainly a very strong point.

In mario kart 8, the characters don't matter besides the 3 (6) weight categories. They simply look different. There is a whole lot of characters to unlock and if they would have been different from one another, it certainly would have added more depth to the game. Sure, it's nice to play with your favorite character, but for someone who's less interested in the lay out and cares more about the gameplay, it isn't really worth unlocking them.

A nice addition to the game is the option to build your own carts/bikes. Each part has their own stats, which is nice, but to me, the stats don't seem to matter much. Different bikes/cars don't require a unique way of driving, besides the difference between bikes and cars. The parts also often have the same stats, making it also visuals, pretty much.

Cool about this game is that it has zero gravity. You can drive upside down and on the walls. I also like the flying parts. However, because of the way the camera always follows the car, you can't really see the difference between being upside down or not. The flying parts are cool, but what would have been really nice is if it was optional. Being able to turn your car into a kite at all times. It would allow all sorts of techniques to get past obstacles and would add much more depth.

Something else I don't really like about this game is the lack of options. There is no option screen whatsoever. No way to turn down the music or change the controls. Also, using any controller other than the gamepad is somewhat buggy. Whenever you lay down your controller for a while, you can't pick it up and keep on playing. Instead, it suddenly goes to the gamepad, forcing to use that instead.

The game is also rather short, because it's so easy. At 150 CC you finally get the feeling you have to do something, so you can finish the game the first day. Luckily you can play online, so the game becomes both more challenging and it extends the duration. It's just not something I enjoy, because it doesn't take much skill but a whole lot of luck.

Overall:
It's a very fun game. It's casual and relaxing and lots of fun with friends. But casual it is. It is in no way competitive. The game doesn't take much skill to master, but it is very dependent on items, meaning it is a very luck based game. In competitions, you try to avoid luck based factors as much as possible and in this game it can't be avoided, especially because the game doesn't have much else to offer.

The graphics are great and the music is good too. The game plays like a charm and everyone can jump right in, without needing a lot of practise. You can play with all controllers (from gamepad to nunchuks), so everyone can use whatever they want.

Overall I give this game a 6.5",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GridironCJ,12-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a fun game, but it fails to take the series anywhere it hasn't been before and suffers from Nintendo's laziness in a few areas. Let's start off with the good. There are plenty of courses and a decent roster of characters to choose from. Nintendo added a little more depth by being able to choose your vehicle type, tires, and air peripheral. The game is colorful and looks decent for a Nintendo game. Why am I saying decent a lot? I'm simply not very impressed overall with this game. The graphics, while decent for a Nintendo game, are still very lackluster. There are a lot of rough edges and the detail just isn't there. Then again, I have higher standards than the average gamer. Additionally, you can no longer carry more than one item at a time. This makes the game a little less strategic, which is unfortunate. The battle mode is probably the worst-executed part of the game. There aren't even specialized maps for battle. Nintendo literally took some of the race courses and made them battle courses. Online multiplayer is also very underwhelming, as you cannot fill and entire race with human opponents.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a fun, but lacking game. It would be nice to see Nintendo try a little harder next time and not take the easy way out in so many areas.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ozorxoron,09-06-2014,"This is an incredibly fun game don't get me wrong, if you enjoy doing the same thing over and over and over then this is the game for you, it's just it lacks any real content. Sure it has a lot of tracks, but 50% of those tracks are pulled from previous games, some of which are absolutely tedious and make me question who in their right mind decided to bring them back. The variety of characters is very poor, it's mainly an assortment of your usual Mario, Luigi and Peach and then the babified versions of those characters and even metal versions of Mario and Peach. The variety is sorely lacking with the characters, I have no idea why as there's a lot of characters to choose from in the Mario-verse.

My biggest problem with this game comes from the lack of things to do, sure racing is fun for a few hours against the AI, then you realise over a decade later they still haven't fixed the AI to target anyone but you, so that spoils racing against the AI. The multiplayer is fun, sure, when you're not being disconnected from races. Even then it's just a matter of time before this games goes from amazing fun to tedium as you're just playing the same maps with the same vehicle over and over with nothing really changing.

lordrichington,04-06-2014,"As far as value goes, given that we got a free game with it - this game is worth it.

This is only aimed at the veteran. Disregard and buy if you are new to MK.

I give this game 5/10 because for all its colourful splendour - it was still boring me, an hour in.

.. It just has really very little new to offer. Most of the additional things are cute but gimmicky stuff that will only be used if you're stuck in the later places, looking for something to boost you back into contention. I don't begrudge that, but I know how to play the game so I just barely see that - and really, the longer you play the game, the less interest you have in the items.

Sure, we get customisation of ""parts"" to karts - but at the end of the day, that just doesn't really have much impact.

Tracks look nice, but are fairly easy and you're effectively vying for first place, during your first lap (there are no real surprises). Drive well, slide round corners, rinse and repeat. We've been here before.

Who really cares whether we're underwater or hovering on jets? Either way, the aim is to slide around the corners with the EXACT SAME handling.

My point is, there is no further effective changes to game play and really quite frustratingly there are no battle tracks, which means you're really basically reduced to doing the same thing you were doing on the previous game.

It might sound like I'm trolling to give it 5/10, but it's the eighth game in this series and if you're a veteran, you can go buy a very lowly rated game and at least get an hour into it without being tired. I haven't played a single minute of mario kart in about 2 years, prior to playing this and it was instantly underwhelming.

It's still ok at the price and current offer, but it's certainly a very mediocre effort by Nintendo - who have in the past really innovated - and with the state of this console, I really expected more. Give us race modes, give us battle arenas, give us handicap options, something!

When you've played this game for a couple of hours, you will realise this game is iterative. There may be tons of gushing reviews at the moment, but that will wash away, soon enough.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

1 No hay escenarios para batalla de balones, jugar en las pistas no son divertidas

Even when you play at your best, especially in online races, you will frequently acquire coins from item boxes. Another flaw is the character roster; where is Diddy Kong and Dry Bones? Instead of giving us these original characters (and more), we get five babies, two palette swaps, and the seven minions for Bowser. This is the worst list of characters yet, and it would have been nice to play as different colors of Yoshi and Toad. Finally, the Battle Mode is complete garbage now; you only have eight battle courses, and they are all race tracks. I'm pretty sure you get the idea. As for the good, it's not enough to revive this ridiculous game. The visuals are indeed the best, the controls are smooth, the music is mostly fantastic, but the amount of courses should have increased from 32 to about 50. What about the gameplay? Well, it is extremely simple, and it didn't change a whole lot. I wish Mario Kart 8 was more like it's hand-held predecessor, but with more content to boot.

MissFelixia,15-05-2015,"this review is for online mainly since thats probably where you'll be the most for online its too unbalanced to even rate so the score is lowered once again. 0/10 for online. seriously a coin in last place? or a single mushroom? i've had worse dice rolls. it seemed to start balanced but i swear as the rank increases they decide to change that.
for offline its a mediocre 6/10
sorry but mediocre at best rather play the wii version more. the graphics and gameplay is amazing but you'll get frustrated at the addition of the stupid coin item. want bannana only mode well i guess the coin is a bannana now. want a franic powerful items game yet again the coin is a powerful item apparently same with bob-ombs only. the Ai in this is lame as soon as you realise you can pick the slowest car even on 150cc and destroy the ai. but again that and the coin ruin what could have been an amazing game. only thing worth getting it for is the time trial. as for online yeh its pretty fun up to about 5k points then the dice rolls will screw you over in 5th? heres a coin or in 5th heres 3 mushrooms while the person in front gets a bullet bill. items just seems messed up this game. battle arenas have gone and also small but noticable is podium finishes. i hope the next game is better than this. sorry but after many many bs unbalanced online matches the score is lowered. to a 2 from a 6 if you want online get sonic and sega all stars racing if you want a family experence get this. this is unbalanced to all hell and not even better than the wii version. the Ai is really bad in this also probably cause they dunno how to balance their game but for single player this is the worst mario kart game so far. get it preowned for the time trials thats all your gonna have fun with.",0,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
endn,31-07-2014,"Worst Mario Kart. I appreciate the updated graphics, but the core gameplay is broken. Items are no fun to use because tracks are often too wide and splits into two or more paths that racers are too far apart. Not to mention you rarely get fun item if you are top 3. Battle mode is completely ruined.

AI cheats too obviously. For example you can be #1 for 2 laps and everybody seems to catch up in the last lap. Unlockables are lackluster. Ugly kart design, either too serious or too childish looking. Very unspired. Too much focus on collecting coins. Too many bowser children.

My wife and I loved Mario Kart since Super Nintendo. It's gotten worse over the years but there were always something interesting that kept us playing. This is the first Mario Kart that my wife actually quits before we complete 100cc. Said it felt like a chore.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The anti-gravity is a neat feature. It has great tracks, and a lot of them. They have some remakes as well, my favorite being moo moo meadows. The battles are a little different I like them but I miss the large area maps and bomb bomb battles. Hopefully they can add stuff in with updates in the future.

Pongdok,01-07-2014,"My wife and I were extremely excited for this game. We tried to find one of the bundles, but ended up buying the game separately. No big deal. We got home and started playing it. The come-down was pretty hard.

The good:
- Looks great
- Drives alright

The Bad:
- Boring character selection
- Unnecessary Kart customization (go play gran turismo, or whatever...)
- Tracks excessively wide and devoid of interesting features (Anti-G doesn't appear to actually do anything.)
- Can't pick up a second item while trailing the first or surrounded by the 3-shell shield
- Track maps are on the game pad, for some reason. (I know you have a directive to use the game pad as much as possible to make it feel relevant, but busting the game isn't the best approach. Nobody should be looking down at the controller while trying to play a driving game.)

The very, very, very bad...:
- R.I.P. Battle Mode (Some people may not care, but this was an enormous disappointment for me.)

o.O Look at all these 10/10 reviews from what I assume are Nintendo PR spammer accounts and people who have never played a proper Mario Kart game. (You have my eternal scorn and heartfelt pity, respectively.)

While I appreciate whatever effort has been put into this, the focus is dreadfully wrong. Graphics and attempts at innovation are fine, but if you get the feel wrong, the fun just drains away and I want to go play another game. Use a variety of play testers next time, (ideally from as many demographics as you can get) and listen to what your old, die-hard fans tell you prior to release day.

I would play Mario Kart (SNES), Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart Double Dash before this.

I feel like my key gripe is MK8's bafflingly idiotic iteration of battle mode. Balloon battles don't belong on the circuit tracks, and they certainly don't need a dozen computer-controlled characters driving around fouling everything up. If I wanted to fight computers, I'd go race. I feel like they were put in because of the lack of proper battle arenas. Even with a bunch of extra cannon(turtle shell?)-fodder racing around in circles the 'battle tracks' feel huge and empty. There is no complex strategy and no sense of exhilaration or anticipation as you might have experienced stalking each other around the Block Fort in MK 64. In MK8, you either chase an enemy or try to joust in the second or two between when you see him and when you pass each other. This new battle mode is unplayable garbage, not worthy of a top-tier Nintendo release. Seriously, whoever gave the O.K. for this needs to get out of the video game industry and go become an accountant or investment banker.

If there is no patch to address some of these issues, then this was my last Mario Kart game. I'd feel completely cheated if it hadn't come with a download code for Pikmin 3.

I am holding out hope that the new Smash Bros. won't be a dumpster fire like this drek. If that's rubbish, I'll probably just play the Project M mod for Brawl and retire Nintendo to nostalgia-town.

icedchoffee,05-06-2014,"this game needs soooo much fixing, dont get me wrong its a good game i completed all the cups already with atleast a 1 star rating but the items and karts are sooo dumb. first of all the kart parts have ""stats"" in which some have more speed than others and some may have more acceleration, but none of those stats come into effect. i play as morton (heavy) on the sport bike with azure roller tires and the bowser kite. the stats for that is (4.25 speed, 4.0 accel, 3.75 weight, 3.25 handling and 1.75 traction) that is a great balance of a high amount of speed and acceleration but noooooo in this game ive gotten passed by normally driving by mario, who is a medium player, with the Standard kart, standard tires and the super glider which has (3.75 speed, 2.5 accel, 3.75 weight, 3.25 handling and 3.75 traction) so nintendo is trying to go above and beyond with these features of customizable karts but you basically customize them for show since the stats dont apply to the game at all. Second, the items in this game suck, ive gotten a star in 2nd place, that really doesnt make any sense at all in my eyes, when you get hit by an item its almost like youre stunned for 15 seconds, ive been in first place slipped on a banana and was sent all the way back to 7th in a matter of seconds. in mario kart wii, which is the best mario kart, when you had a mushroom or a star it would give u a noticably big speed boost...... not in mario kart 8, there is probably a 2% speed boost tops when activating star power. mushrooms in this game barely add speed as well, ive had a golden mushroom before and was passed by a person getting a boost from drifting.......wtf is that crap. there really needs to be something changed with the items with how often you get a certain item, what places can and cant get certain items, faster and more powerful boosts with mushrooms or stars and even the bullet bill. the bullet bill is complete garbage in this game. if nintendo is going to implement kart stats they should at least make it balanced or just have the stats removed. in addition to that, the stats are completely unfair, heavy characters start off with a base stat of (4.75 speed which is already fast, 2.0 accel, 4.75 weight, 2.25 handling and 3.25 traction) with just a base stat of that is completely over powered. having a footrace on mario circuit with heavy against light, heavy would win because of the speed they have(light has a base stat of 2.25 speed). overalll this game is completely 100% broken from items to stats to stun from items.right now with my experience on this game i would give it a 2.5 out of 5 and im a great Nintendo fan, but they really messed up this game and its bad.",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SuperAttackGame,04-06-2014,"This is, without a doubt, the biggest letdown in the Mario Kart series, a middle finger salute to the fans. Mario Kart 8 is a result of taking out everything that makes Mario Kart good, and leaves in the bad. Mario Kart 7 was pretty much the refined Mario Kart of the series, but that doesn't mean there was nothing to improve upon. They could have at least tried to make it on par with 7, but instead it was like they deliberately held back on this one. Were they trying to make sure there was enough to improve upon with Mario Kart 9? Because you don't do that. You don't try and make a sequel less than perfect so you can make the next sequel better. That's just a blatant, lazy excuse for money. To be a little more specific on why this game is bad - remember Mario Kart Wii, with its sloppy controls and rubber band AI? It's back in 8, maybe even worse this time around. How can they take such a step backwards? The stage design is also incredibly flat and uninspired, ironic given the anti-gravity feature, and that in itself is not utilised at all because I barely felt like I was going anit-gravity, and the stages are still flat.

It's very upsetting to see Mario Kart, of all franchises, become a lifeless shell of what it once was. 8 is the unlucky number for Mario spin-off sequels, it seems. This is the Mario Party 8 of the series, proof that people are getting sick of the series. Mario Kart will no longer be the big party game hit it once was, because even the biggest Mario Kart fans will have little good to say about this slump in the series. If we're very lucky, by Mario Kart 9 they will realise what they did wrong with this one and win everyone back - but let's face it, that's not very likely. Go away, Mario Kart.

LBC,31-05-2014,"A fantastic game that deserves every one of its accolades! I do have a few gripes though. I can't understand why Nintendo still insists on making retro courses. There are only 32 courses in the game, and half of them are regurgitated from old games. Why not have 24 new courses and 8 retro courses? Yes, they've been updated and retrofitted with all the latest features, but there's still an inescapable sense of deja vu. I'm also baffled by all the ""baby"" characters, but I guess Mario Kart is the most logical series to feature them.

Battle mode has been thoroughly re-worked, with disappointing results. Its more of an afterthought, really. I can't imagine you and your friends will spend too much time here.

There are some nice balancing touches in MK8. You can now block the infamous blue shell with a new item. To balance this, Nintendo has taken away the ability to pick up a new item while holding one behind you (banana, shell, etc). You can also boost off of other players (or give them a boost) while using anti gravity. Its a neat little game mechanic that adds a risk / reward factor to the racing.

Mario Kart 8 is an awesome game! However, as I've noted before, the Wii U library is still a barren wasteland when compared to PS4 and XB1. Don't rush out and buy a Wii U just for this game. You'll be sorely disappointed with your options once your through with Mario Kart 8.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
WildFire15,31-05-2014,"Mario Kart remains the prime example of what Nintendo is capable of. To some, that means rehashing the same franchise (and usually fail to acknowledge Call of Dutys and Assassin's Creeds are far worse if you consider rehashes to be lots of sequels), but for Nintendo it means adding new mechanics and tweaking existing ones to perfection.
Courses are well designed, items are better balanced (even better so as you can't hoard a spare, not to mention the Blue Shell finally has a proper counter) and the general handling is perfect. Graphical and audio wise, it's a step ahead of even next-gen offerings, reminding once again that pure graphical horse power does not instantly make a game visual superior. Online is also well developed and smooth, though it would be nice if, when choosing tracks in random games you could choose from all of them rather then 3 randomly picked ones and a random option.
MKTV's a neat additional feature as well, allowing you to upload automatically generated highlight reels of your races. There's little manual control beyond who gets focused on and what sort of content/length you want, but it's still a cool item to have.
There are aspects that aren't perfect, of course. If you don't like Mario Kart then 8 isn't going to change your mind, the lack of actual battle arenas is disappointing and for some reason playable Miis all where helmets (so they may as well be anyone), but if you've been sat on the fence about the Wii U, now's the perfect time to get one for this game.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

X-fushion,12-09-2014,"This game is overrated within the context of it own series, While Mario Kart 8 is a solid, fun and well designed (for the most part) it has some issues that put it away from ""perfection"". In the core Mario Kart 8 is great, the tracks are well designed and every single one has an unique charm, both visually and technically also you don't feel that the tracks are the same all of them had ""personality"", their own gimmicks and obstacles making them fun and challenging to play. Other welcome addition new vehicle customization the game, is kind of basic but works well, it suits your play style better and the vehicle classes (Kart ,bike, sport bike and ATV) bring balance to the game and more variety some vehicles like karts are better in straight line tracks while others like the sport bikes do better in sharp curves tracks, picking your vehicle is no longer a ""it looks cool"" fact it's about what vehicle suits you best and it brings more depth in the game. Also Drifting and mini turbo are nearly mandatory in the game, there's no longer an automatic or manual option, fortunately performing a drifting is vey easy unlike Mario kart wii and more responsive, master it to perform the super mini turbo requires a little practice but nothing hard or out of place, while it's possible to play the game without drifting is a game breaker if you decide to not, since all the CPU by default do it, and most of the players also do it because is to simple to execute, so don’t be surprised if you lose most of the time because you are not drifting. So at this point it sounds that Mario Kart 8 is a game that involves pure skill, well yes but also involves luck in the form of items the series had since the beginning you know throwing shells at opponents, using mushrooms to boost, that kind of stuff, unfortunately the very items is the downfall of Mario Kart 8, making it a game more about luck than skill. It's true that in Mario Kart luck comes to place but in past MK games skill was a more important factor sure you can be in 10th place and get cool items like the golden mushroom and bullet bills, but no matter how good the items were they meant little if the guy at 1st place was good at driving, and Mario kart 8 is the complete opposite for the most part, is more about the items you get than how good you are at driving. Let me go more in depth in Past Mario Kart Games, Like Mario Kart Wii for instance there was always called ""item priority"" this means that the lower you are in the place list you'll get better offensive items like a star, 3 red shells, a lighting, etc. and the higher you were you'll get basic offensive items and more defensive items, like a single red shell, bananas, green shells etc. So it worked well giving the guy in 12th place an edge to pass the opponents while giving the guy in fist place basic items to ""shield"" him/herself from the rest. In Mario Kart 8 that is no more, Item priority now is random, except from the guy in first place, so now you van get stars in 3rd place, triple red shells in second, lightning in fourth and even a bullet bill in fifth place, but in 1st place is more common to get the new coin item that a defensive item like a green shell, the coins in the game act like a boost you can collect them in the track or by getting one at the item box, collect 10 of them and you'll gain a little speed boost, the problem is that collecting 10 coins is way to easy and most of the time in 1st place you'll stock up real quick, not to mention that the coin item still appears even if you are max out, this means that the game somehow has the 1st place items prioritized by making coins more common that actual items, so this means that if you manage to get to 1st place there's barley any way to defend yourself from items. So that just throw over the window the whole skill add-ons like customization and drifting, sure there's some skill involved but now the guy that gets the better items wins this is way more notorious if you play online. So follow my strategy, don't ever try to be on first place the whole race always try to be in 3rd or lower that way you'll get all the cool items while the lead player can barely do anything to protect him/herself and when the final lap comes then try to lead the race at the half of the track, is more likely that you'll win this way than by trying to speed up all the time. Also there's no battle mode, well it is but is way to broken, the battles are without a radar in the main tracks, so yeah no battle arenas just tracks, is very uncomfortable to play, you'll spend 99% of the time trying to look for the other players and is just not fun at all. Mario Kart 8 still of its flaws still a good, fun game and you can have a great time with it, but is way to far to be the best Mario kart game.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

funkamonkey,04-06-2014,"After selling my Wii U last year due to the lack of games, I always knew I would return for some Mario Kart action. This has been my favourite franchise and has always been a great series to play with friends.

Mario Kart 8 is no different. It's brings fun back to your living room and with the solid, and free, online features, MK8 is the perfect progression of the series.

The first thing that hits you is the HD graphics. From the load screen and replays to the reflections on the players helmets, Nintendo have gone all out to impress this time round.

The gameplay is amazing fun and even better online. The customisations, although a tad limited, are a great addition to the home console version and the tracks are designed with love and attention.

It's not perfect by any means. The reason it doesn't get a ten is because the single player seems to be a lot easier than previous games and the battle mode has been ruined but this game is all about multiplayer racing, both local and online.

Get some mates together or fire up the online mode and this is where MK8 excels.

If you love gaming or you just wanted a reason to buy a Wii U, this is it.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
mattnotley2004,15-06-2014,"Mario Kart with stunning HD graphics + full orchestrated music + new game mechanics (driving up walls, etc) = Awesomeness!

PanthersFanStev,31-05-2014,"Beautiful, shiny, fast racing game is a good description. Awesome courses and very fun online play. Don't hate me here, but I cannot help but compare to MK Wii which was better IMO. Why was MK Wii better? Character roster, tracks and challenge to unlock karts and characters. At current pace I will have everything unlocked in a week, it took 2+ months of play on MK Wii which made it more fulfilling to me. Hoping there are some additional characters to unlock, I am a fan of Dry Bones Bowser, Funky Kong and others that were dropped for Koopalings. That said, this is a MUST BUY Wii U game that you would be crazy to pass up, especially with the free game offer.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ransonshan,27-06-2014,"Being the 8th installment of a beloved franchise, I expected this game to do great. I was wrong, it did not do fantastic for my standards, IT SURPASSED ALL OF MY STANDARDS! This game was the reason I bought a Wii U like most people did and I don't regret one penny I spent on this title. The graphics are superb, one of the best looking Wii U titles on earth. You can see every detail on every character and kart in the game as well as the wonderfully creative courses new to the series. The sound is a mix of classic, adrenaline-pumping, calm, jazzy, psychedelic, and fun soundtracks to go along with updated remixes of old stages. Playing split screen, once again, is a blast with friends and strangers alike. Being an Assassin's Creed multiplayer fan only, i had little expectation for this game's online multiplayer. How wrong I was, this is one of if not the most addicting multiplayer I have ever being happy to be apart of in the digital age of gaming. The lag is noticeably absent for the most part and never had i felt so comfortable playing with other players online thanks to this game's beginner-friendly community. If anytime you come across i player or players so far out of your league, there is nothing preventing you from limiting your options to lower level players in the new custom menu to get used to the game's controls and stages. The single player mode in this title has been flushed out more than any other game in the series thus far, making the 150cc AI much harder this time around for added competition as well as the new highlight system to give your single player experience better purpose than just to waste time. This game features an all-star cast of unforgettable Mario characters as well as lesser-known characters. Kart customization is back from Mario Kart Wii and I am glad to say that the kart customization is much more expansive and offers a large variety of control setups depending on your character, wheels, and glider. The anti-gravity featured in most stages gives off such a vibe that was absent from previous games, making the stages feel grand and epic simultaneously with its large array of gimmicks and visual spectacles. So after all of that you may think this is the absolute perfect Mario Kart ever made, I wish I could say that. The main beef many people have with this game (and many reasons there are more negative than mixed scores) is the lack of classic battle mode. By that I mean it ditched the arena concept of the original games and instead opted for the players to race ON THE RACE TRACKS to battle one another. I appreciate trying something new but this was not the way to go, this mode can drag on and most of the time players barely make contact with other racers. Fix this mode and all that remain are very minor nitpicks, like the meta-game first place player being safer in this game than ever before compared to 2nd, 3rd, or 4th place players fearing for their lives. Overall, a phenomenal game with all the reason in the world to buy a Wii U.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Namloc,10-07-2014,"It’s really good, but its not a 10, Heres some reasons why.

The controls defaults to motion control so wiimote players have to constantly pause the game at the start of races to change the controls. On top of that, there aren't any options including no option to customize the button layout.

At the end of the race, “Next race” isn’t the default option, (View highlights is)

Weak character lineup (40% babies and kids)

Poor online features - No leagues/brackets for online racing, (you start at 1000 points, win = + Loss = -, but you have no idea where you sit in your region/global, aka perhaps you’re on 1484 points but are still 6000 behind 90th place? Who know’s) I’d like to know what bracket I’m in, e.g. a silver bracket racer aiming for gold etc.

No proper battle mode maps, seriously they couldn't really be worse, common complaint and it’s utterly bizarre they went with the normal tracks, it simply doesn't work well.

As I said before, there’s No Options e.g. adjust volume, screen brightness, control options, game settings like lap count, Option to choose to split screen horizontally as opposed to the default vertical split, there’s nothing…

No pressure sensitive acceleration which would be nice, pressing A seems dated, it’s not the end of the world but trigger accelerators are better.

No track editor which would add so much vaule. Allowing the community to expand on the track list would add so much value to the game and its future. They could introduce something similar to counter strike GO where community developed maps become official map packs for a price, in which the community developers are credited a percentage of the earnings for their awesome work. There’s a lot of ways they could benefit from allowing the community to develop maps. It’s a real shame.

Introduce an online compeditive team scene.
4 vs 4 vs 4 team modes to better include competitive play online, using the usually 15-1 point system, tally the points at the end of 4+ races and see which team won. Would also be nice for battle mode (but you’d still need proper battle mode maps) Top all this off with nice team rankings so you have an exact idea where your team is placed in regional/global standings.

Custom paint designs for karts, Let me pick and choose which color scheme I want thank you very much.

Time to change the franchise name to Nintendo Kart? So we can have characters from the other franchises too. It sounds like it’s going to happen anyway with amiboo toys so perhaps for MK9?

It's still a great game, but it's not a 10. I think anyone who plays PC games online will feel as though Nintendo is still lagging behind badly at this stage. No known development road map or patches to look forward to, what you see is what you get which seems behind the current times.
Still... I recommend the game if you have a Wii U but don't buy a console exclusively to play it.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ericiidx,31-05-2014,"So far, an incredible refresher on the pretty familiar Mario Kart formula. For the first time ever, kart handling finally feels like an organic thing! The graphics are just right, the artistic design is out of this world, and the environments are exploding with detail and personality. There's some pretty nice item balancing going on, especially since things can get nasty with 12 players. I've played every Mario Kart game (most of them thoroughly,) and this is shaping up to be the best one yet.

My only complaints are negligible ones; for example, you are given the names of selectable tracks in a multiplayer session, but the names are removed when the random selection takes place. The new anti-grav element feels more like a gimmick than anything else, but it does subtly provide shortcut opportunities and more eye candy, without taking anything away from the core experience.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JohnWitten,29-09-2014,"Overall Premise: Improve the series in many ways imaginable and as of yet not thought of.

Graphics and Sound: The visuals look excellent on the Wii U and are the best in the series so far. Sound is comprised of good track selection and audio accompaniment ambiance as well.

Playability and Entertainment: The gameplay is even more fun thanks to new twists and turns, literally at times. The controls work well on the standard controller.

Replay Value: Moderately High.

Game got beautiful graphics, nice music, awesome tracks, and smooth online play (played quite a lot online, and haven't experienced any lag at all yet). In my opinion, this is the best mario kart game ever made. Items seems more balanced before (now its more about skill than luck), and there is finally a counter to the blue shell. Only thing i find disappointing is that they included unnecesarily many baby characters, and like gold peach for example.. Wth is that? Id much rather see diddy kong, boo, or how about cranky kong? Now that would be great. Apart from characters the game seems perfect to me. Don't get me wrong, some of the koopalings (new characters) are cool, but like i've said there are too many baby characters. Id swap baby daisy for diddy kong any day.

That title goes to ""Mario Kart 8,"" an absolutely gorgeous, rip-roaring, fun-filled, exciting time on the Wii U. On top of being gorgeous and fun, the music is brilliant and the online is actually pretty excellent, even on a console like the Wii U that has an awful online infrastructure.
Sure, the roster may have a few too many unnecessary additions, and the Battle Mode may not be as exciting as the previous adventures, but at the very end of the day, ""Mario Kart 8"" is the one Wii U game that you absolutely must own.

rushiosan,29-10-2014,"A 10/10 game if you look back at what the franchise achieved since 1990's, but a 6/10 in a matter of gameplay.

Mario Kart 8 suffers from major problems of item balancing and the gap between skill / luck that spoiled previous entries, but this time things got even worse. To put in simple words, it punishes good players. It's not a goot thing to stay in first, second or third places because your item sorting was greatly nerfed to either coins (absolutely useless) and bananas all the time. Forget green or red shells if you're 1st to 3rd place. The game is meant to punish good players even at vs CPU races, which's absolutely atrocious and frustrating. Why is there content to unlock by winning single-player cups then? This setting works perfectly for multiplayer parties because it gives everyone in the room a chance to win against a good player, but throwing that at CPU matches is absolutely non-sense.

I put this game down after finishing all mirror cups and I rarely play now. Videogames are meant to be enjoyed, not to frustrate you. Leave the ""luck"" aspect to board games and stuff.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Krobolt,02-06-2014,"There’s no denying that the Wii U has suffered a dry library of games for the last few months.
With the release of Mario Kart 8, Wii U owners have a new reason to return to their Gamepads. Mario Kart 8 is filled with the traditional upgrades: new weapons, new tracks, new mechanics, and new characters. All of these elements are fantastic as ever, but it’s the game’s attractive visuals and endless entertaining replay value makes it one of the best the series has to offer.

The newest mechanic introduced in Mario Kart 8 is its anti-gravity gameplay. Many walls and roads feature blue lines that will shift your tires sideways and magnetize your vehicle against the track. Gravity transitions are seamless and offer shortcuts even boosts to help anyone lagging behind. Colliding with other drivers on anti-gravity sections gives racers a boost allowing racers to take advantage of the completion in new ways. Gravity sections also include rotating pegs that racers can drive into to gain speed. These features can allow a racer to come from behind and take advantage of their surroundings to gain the upper hand.

Amongst the new features, includes new weapons as well. A new boombox item known as the “Super Horn” amides shockwaves that knocks out racers and can even destroy items including the infamous blue shell. Another new item is a piranha plant, which is a multipurpose item. When active, it chomps at anything in front of the racer, including opposing racers and obstacles. If there isn’t anything to hit, the piranha chomps at the air and offers the racer speed bursts. The boomerang flower allows the racer to throw a boomerang up to three times, with a chance to hit as it travels forward and back. Finally, the “Lucky Seven” item makes a return in the form of the “Crazy Eight” as eight items rotate around the racer giving the racer multiple options to devastate the competition.

Upon hitting the track, there’s no way to ignore the gorgeous visuals Mario Kart 8 has to offer. Its vivid colors and bloom bring the tracks to life and easily makes this game one of the best looking on the Wii U, even surpassing Super Mario 3D World. Many of the first races I shared with friends left them in awe as they stopped to notice the beautiful environments.

Each course in Mario Kart 8 is finely tuned, with tracks such as Toad Harbor, Mount Wario, Electrodome, and Sunshine Airport standing out as personal favorites of mine. Maro Kart 8 also houses the best versions of Mario Circuit, featuring a Mobius Strip style course, and Bowser’s Castle, which features a gigantic statue of the villain punching ripples into the track. Course design shines even brighter in their retro tracks. Royal Raceway is beaming with life and color and the inclusion of Rainbow Road from the Nintendo 64 redone as a beautiful grand finale is astonishing.

The cast of characters is as strong as ever, with 30 drivers to choose from. There are several new characters that make their first appearance as playable drivers, including the Koopalings from Super Mario Bros 3. Characters are unlocked at random after completing cups, unlike previous Mario Kart games. Although the cast of characters is welcome, it is bulked with Baby characters as well as the many Koopalings leaving out the chance for a more diverse selection such as Boo, Bowser Jr, even R.O.B.

Vehicle customization returns once again in Mario Kart 8. After choosing a driver, you put together your Kart, choosing a body, wheels, and glider individually to create your ideal ride. Whether its speed, handling, or even style, there is a wide variety of parts to choose from, with more to be unlocked as you collect more coins. You are not only limited to karts this time; Bikes return from Mario Kart Wii as well as ATVs which make their debut in this game. Each vehicle is fun to drive. Even after hours of playing with one vehicle, I still found myself toying with the customization finding new satisfying combinations.

As with each entry to proceed, Mario Kart 8 shines most within its multiplayer modes. With multiple controller options, it’s easy to set up races with multiple friends. For the first time, up to four players can participate in grand prix tourneys. Competing against your friends as well as eight CPU racers is as fun as ever. Along with Grand Prix, one to four players can also compete in versus mode, which feature completely customizable rules (bikes only, no items, etc.). Playing single player or with one friend runs smoothly at 60 frames per second, but adding more players makes a noticeable frame difference. It may appear slower, but nothing game breaking such lag. You can even take the action online, where you and another friend can set up games against friends and random players. One disappointing feature is its battle mode, which abandons unique arenas from previous games in favor of competing on standard race tracks.

Another new feature is its new Mario Kart TV system. At the end of each race, you’re given the option to watch a replay of your previous race. Each replay is fully customizable, from length to highlighted moments, such as drifts, actions, items, etc. It’s easy to edit, fast-forward and slo-mo each clip. You can even focus the camera on certain racers and watch their expressions as they jump ramps and slide past their competition. You cannot completely control the camera in this mode which seems like a missed opportunity. After you finish editing your clip, you can save it among your favorite with a star, or share it to the Miiverse and Youtube.

Most Mario Kart games stand out amongst others. Mario Kart 64 is a nostalgic classic to fans, and Double Dash shined with its unique gameplay mechanics. Mario Kart 8 deserves to be added to top-tier entries, with its rock-solid package that offers so much to all. Mario Kart 8 doesn’t change up the formula much, but it left me smiling the whole way through. Mario Kart 8 is the fast-paced, family-fun game that everyone should enjoy.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

guitarguy001,03-07-2014,"A great Mario Kart entry and my second favorite in the series. The soundtrack is amazing, the retro tracks feel fresh and new with the Mario Kart 8 physics, the new tracks are extremely well designed and the visuals are hands down the best on the Wii U so far; seriously, this game has visuals that i personally feel are on par with Killzone Shadow Fall & Ryse: Son of Rome for some of the best visuals on a console to date. The online is also very well done.

I also noticed that this is probably the fastest Mario Kart when it comes to pace. Lakitu is not slow as a snail as he was in the previous games and the new mechanics with the zero gravity enforce aggressive play as many of the physics have speed boosts.

As for negatives, the roster. The roster is horribly disappointing and uninspired, especially comparing it to Mario Kart Wii and Double Dash (especially the latter). Pink Gold Peach was a completely unnecessary addition and having ALL of the Koopalings as characters are waste of space imo, 3 would have been OK and it would have opened space for other characters like King Boo, Petey Piranha & Funky Kong.

The other negative, the battle mode. The battle mode is no longer arena based, it's now the race tracks and you go against the opponent there. No longer as strategic as the other battle modes especially now since you can no longer get another item when you are already holding another item, and not nearly as fun. Comparing this battle mode to N64's or even Double Dash's battle mode, they make it look like a complete joke.

Besides those two flaws, this game is incredibly fun. It improved Mario Kart in almost every single way with mechanics, soundtrack, track design and visuals (seriously they look amazing) but also makes the retro feel fresh and new. Despite the slightly nerfed multiplayer mode and disappointing roster, i highly recommend this game to anyone who has a Wii U (which probably most of you already own MK8)",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
nonchalantgamer,13-08-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is an awesome addition to the franchise.The racing is as fun as ever, and the few new items they threw in definitely add fun to the variety of items. the tracks are incredible with beautiful visuals and tons of variety within. their are secrets paths to take with mushrooms and the flight paths you can reach and going into and out of the water adds more depth to the tracks. the anti gravity areas on the tracks are very fun add on as well that adds an alternate switch of pace. the amount of cars/parts in the game is crazy and their so many ways you can customize your kart to fit your specific play style. the roster size is fairly large with the additions of bowsers kids and much more. the only gripes i have on the game is that the battle mode is really bad and feels like they got lazy with it just throwing you on the grand prix tracks and going at it, i felt they could have done much more. also the MP as fun as it is the servers are not that good and i cant find matches that often. overall what it comes down to is that alone or sitting in your room with a group of friends, mario kart 8 provides immense amount of fun and good times that will last you for quite a while and brings back so much nostalgia for me as a long time fan.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Luigifan10,31-05-2014,"So, this game has been in development for a while and people say this is one of two games (The other one being Super Smash Bros for Wii U) that will sell the Wii U drastically. And if this game doesn't sell Wii U's, I don't know what will. For starters, this game is absolutely beautiful. The HD and details are insane! Luigi's mustache even blows in the wind! The new anti-gravity is really cool, even if it doesn't change up the core gameplay drastically, which is good. The new items are really cool and aren't over-powered or weak. Well, except for the Coin item. That's the item you'll get most of the time when you're in first, and all it does is add 2 coins to your coin count. The new tracks are some of the coolest ever, and the retro tracks are updated a lot. Except for Music Park. The only thing updated there was the graphics. The new Balloon Battle is a little weird because you're in race tracks instead of in arenas. This is fine, except that it may be hard to find others on occasion, because it's so big. The character selection is actually a little lame. The new Koopalings are pretty cool but another newcomer, being Pink Gold Peach, is a dumb Metal Mario clone. And, not to mention, there are 5 BABIES. 5. I think that's really stupid. The roster is also missing a lot of characters that could be better than others, such as Diddy Kong, Dry Bones, King Boo, etc. But if they add some DLC, then that problem could be fixed. The multiplayer is as fun as its ever been, but it might take a while for everyone to choose their kart combination. I wish there was a faster way to change your kart combo. The online is great, with little to no lag and fair rules for everyone. The reasons I didn't give it a 10/10 are that there are some unnecessary characters and the weird Balloon Battles. If you like Mariokart and don't have a Wii U, this would be a perfect time to get one with the Mariokart 8 Bundle! And if you have a Wii U already, the you need to get this game!

Scottview,05-06-2014,"Although there are a few unfortunate missteps in this new Mario Kart game, such as limited match customization options, Mario Kart TV not realizing its full potential, and a rather gimped battle mode, its not enough to take away how utterly fantastic the traditional racing mode is in this game. Every single new track is a winner; and although the new much touted anti gravity feature never truly gives the sensation that you are upside down or riding on a wall, it allows for track designs that twist and curve in the most interesting and thrilling of ways. There is never a dull moment in a courses design. Necessary tweaks to items and a decreased punishment for getting hit make the game much faster paced, fairer, and more skill based. Gone are the days of ending up in first place by accident. Sure a few fortunate item pickups can help, but you need to use them properly, and if you get to first, by jove you've earned it.

Also, not enough praise can be given to the games presentation. In my opinion, this is hands down the most beautiful game Nintendo has ever produced and the attention to detail is astonishing. The same has to be said for the soundtrack, which strikes the perfect balance between familiar and nostalgic tones with an energetic, jazzy, and more orchestrated sound that pairs perfectly with the frenetic on screen action.

So, in the end, despite a few head scratching and aggravating choices to modes most people won't care to much about, this is probably the purest Mario Kart you can find. The racing mode is the perfect culmination of more than two decades of Mario Kart games and it shows in all the ways that matter the most.

Well it's the playable characters that let it down. From all of Nintendos Mario characters why go with all the Koopa kids, just a little dull and short sighted if you ask me. In addition the Mii characters look terrible. Saying that they looked terrible in the last one so...

I would recommend buying this game for the Wii U you'll have a blast. Get online and get racing!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
deathgz00,03-06-2014,"Nintendo did it again, I've been playing Mario Kart since the 64 era, and never since that time i really had that sensation that Mario kart 64 gave me, the speed, the power, the fx sound, the music; once you start the game goes right to the point, no **** you came to play, you got the game.
P.S. the battle mode was pretty lame, for that reason i don't give a perfect score",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
The90sKid,06-06-2014,"Odd design choices aside, Mario Kart 8 is an awesome addition to an awesome franchise. The single player options will get old fast, but thanks to robust online offerings as well as an unparalleled local multiplayer the game promises to remain an entertaining game for months to come. If you have been on the fence about getting a Wii U let me assure you that Mario Kart 8 is worth getting one for. It is the Wii U's first fully-fledged killer-app. Nobody else makes kart racing this fun. I give Mario Kart 8 a 9/10.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Hipster1989,30-06-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is simply a phenomenal Kart racer/ party game. It is highly competitive off line and online. 150 cc mode is the hardest that I have eve player. The online is well done to making it easy to start matches straight away with anyone around the world.

Mario Kart 8 is the best next gen game so far in my opinion. Forget Titanfall, forget Infamous Second Son. Mario Kart 8 is where it is at.

The only thing I dislike in this Mario Kart is the item selection but new ideas like Mario Kart Tv where you upload video highlights to youtube make up for that.

If you are looking for a fun and challenging single player experience Mario Kart 8 has length as 150cc mode is tough and collating all of the parts, vehicles and characters will take a couple of weeks. Once that is done just play with family and friends when people come over for parties and there is always Mario Kart Tv and the online modes to keep you playing Mario Kart 8 from years to come.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Not more, not less. When you own Nintendo consoles, than you own Mario Kart. That's a fact. And you get what you expect with this one. Better graphics new characters a new vehicle and new stages.
One Major letdown is the vs combat mode. They didnt build new Arenas, they just used the same ones.

1) The battle mode is tremendous better in wii; Seems like nintendo dedevelopers were lazy in this point;
2) The single player mode, to me, is just the same (means not deep);
3) I never tried the online play in wii one, but in the Mk8 the online mode is great. Mention: Missing features: Voice chat (or at least a text one).
4)The visual! One of the great improvement! No coments here more than ""I really love the MK8 visuals;

AVdE,26-08-2014,"Astonishing how beautiful Mario Kart looks in HD! The tracks are fabulous and the anti-gravity makes an exciting and awesome addition in terms of gameplay. Everything about this game is absolutely amazing, with a few exceptions:

The battle mode tracks from previous mario kart games are replaced with slightly modified tracks. This makes battle mode feel a lot like regular racing, so hopefully nintendo will fix this with DLC.

The weapon selection doesn't feel balanced. Sometimes, you get boosts in first place, or a green shell in 8th place or lower. And once you end up in the middle during online races, you get brutally smashed.

A minor flaw is that the gamepad screen displays the same split screen from the TV during local multiplayer, instead of only the own racer's screen.

Further, there are a couple of tiny drawbacks that are going to be fixed with an upcoming update, so they're not really worth mentioning.

Overall though, Mario Kart 8 is an amazing game. It's plenty of fun, it looks gorgeous, it runs smoothly and it's a blast to play with friends.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Would you play it again?

Yes, i really enjoy playing this game but unfortunately the online isn’t that much fun and so to me this is a local player game.

The game play is still of great quality as past Mario Karts and fun like the others. The mode to customize your car is fine, but manipulate their characteristics, can have been omitted.

I would definitely missed more tracks and more variety of characters, I find no difference in using a 5 babies.

vahn,22-04-2015,"Before saying anything, I want to tell right away that this game is fun: there's a lot of stuff in it, a lot of characters, a lot of detail and I really enjoyed it a whole lot when I played it: the new features such as anti-gravity and the glide kind of makes it quite weird but also interesting, without ruining the flow, and a tiny bit of customization that definitely makes the game even more personal. In other words the game is fun, and it was the game that made me purchase the Wii-U.

AND MAN, what a boring-fest after a short while.

Before playing this game I spent at least 50+ hours in a very similar game, and more specifically Sonic All-stars racing transformed, and I had a huge amount of fun in that game for many reasons. But as soon as I went on this game, I finished almost all of the circuits, at 150cc (I can't get the 200c because I can't connect my Wii-U. Thank you for no Ethernet plug Nintendo!)), in a single day. Why? Because it's mindblowingly easy and simple! I finished all my tracks using ONE type of vehicle, ONE set of parts, and rarely lost any race and on top of that each race is incredibly short too, making each race last not even 5 minutes (or barely so).

I mean wow, I don't like to compare games nor to bash on such a famous series of kart games, but I expected much more from this game: aside the usual circuit there isn't much else to do, and while there are many characters to unlock I have only managed to unlock bowser's children and various toads. REALLY?! I don't care about Bowser's sons and toadette, give me the actual real characters of the games! But it doesn't really matter anyway: stats don't really change much if you change character, only the parts you put on your vehicle do and that's it. As far as I noticed, the character is just for visuals.

Sure, the game is a lot of fun to play in multiplayer...but frankly it's barely an excuse: I've played Mario Kart 64 back on the Nintendo...64, and it was way more enjoyable and cured than this game, even in single player. But this game I just got instantly bored as soon as I finished the circuits...oh and I forgot to mention how the AI is atrociously bad, but not in only one way: it's very common at high difficulties to lose a race because, suddenly, ALL of the racers will start throwing their skills at you. It seems like everyone hates the player to the point of not even letting you recover, and the funny part is that only one or two racers will actually reach first and win. throughout all 4 tracks, leaving the rest on the dust.

I suppose they just don't want me to win...I guess I'm even more disliked than Waluigi hm...

At any rate, this is a good game, an excellent racing game BUT with a lot of lackings in my opinion: the Circuits are short, the customization is nearly pointless, the many characters are almost a joke (I don't want mini bowsers or toads copies!!!!!!), and the game doesn't really feel fair in challenge.: on top of that I didn't see any interesting mode except for battle, which is downgraded in comparison to the previous games.

Overall, it's a good game, DEFINITELY not bad, but I can't deny that It made me want to play the Mario Kart 64 the more I played this one. Or Sonic Racing Transformed on the pc...

At least the sensation of speed there is done better....",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

danrenfroe2016,26-10-2014,"Summary

Best Entry in the Mario Kart Series. Even Beats my personal favorites Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart DS.

Presentation

Absolutely perfect, you are greeted with excellently crafted in game models of favorite Nintendo characters, super visuals and great menus and online capability.

Gameplay

AAA gameplay in both the single player player and multi-player modes. I will not go into much detail as other reviews have detailed this completely. The addition of the glider, propeller and hovercraft mechanic is great and feels so much like Mario Kart even though it is new to the series. the Level design is absolutely top notch except for I would have liked more shortcuts. Also the mushroom powerup has been de-rated way to much for my liking. The other outstanding accomplishment is that the realism has been kicked up several notches (Don't worry its still Mario kart physics). All the Karts and bikes now have working suspension and wonderful cartoon like animations. Never have I felt that Wario and all the other playable characters were more alive. Their distinct personalities and traits really poke me with joy as I race the different characters.

DLC: a welcome addition as they are adding different characters and Zelda for the first time is racing... And 16 additional tracks are incoming as well...

Disappointment: Battle arenas are gone?!? I really hope Nintendo adds them back in within a game update as this is not cool...

Graphics

Stunning... Stunning... Stunning. This showcases the Wii U capabilities with special effects, great multi-layered textures and stunning lighting. Its amazing the difference in areas like moo-moo farm when comparing the Wii U and the Wii version. Runs at a steady 60fps for single and two player, and 30fps for 3 or 4 player.

Sound

Great sound, good Jazz music and effects. However I am disappointed with the 6.1 mix again...

But the gameplay itself in MK8 is so ridiculously polished and amazing that for me, all of that was overshadowed. Sure, Nintendo didn't include as many bells and whistles in MK8 as in other titles, but as a game itself, it can't be faulted. Presentation and graphics are all top notch, and the music is absolutely stellar with its unique orchestration and various styles. There's also a lot of nuance to the courses with anti-gravity, air, and sea travel finally implemented on a console MK.

The free game offer from Nintendo sweetened the deal for me though, so I went ahead and bought it and I am so glad I did. It... is... AMAZING! It has some of the best, if not the best graphics in a Wii U game to date. The courses are cleverly designed and it features very addicting multiplayer and challenges. It even allows for voice chat with friends. (Although it would have been cool to have voice chat with all players.) The one thing I didn't like though, was the battle mode.

zaaKun,13-07-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is a great game and definitely a reason to get the Wii U. But even though it's great, it also has its flaws.

One of the greatest for me is that you're really defenseless being in first position. Most of the time you will get some coins that are neither useful for defense nor offense.

Another one for me is the NPC behaviour. I've been obversing one thing: if a NPC gets first place in a race, he'll most likely also get first place in all the consecutive races IF YOU don't prevent it. This may be just coincidence, but I've played the game a lot in the last few days and that's what I noticed.

I really dislike the Battle-mode. It's just on normal tracks that go both ways. I only remember how the battle mode in Mario Kart 64 was, and it was really fun, not at all comparable with the one Mario Kart 8 brings.

ricklongo,14-07-2014,"Coming in at a time when the Wii U needs heavy-hitting powerhouses to turn its fortunes around, Mario Kart 8 is breath of fresh multiplayer air in the console's growing line of must-have titles. The ""killer app"" title would fit quite well here; it's not the absolute best game on the Wii U right now, but it's certainly the one with the largest widespread appeal.

As anyone can immediately tell, this is a game with great attention to detail. The pristine HD graphics are amazing, and they're made even better by the extensive replay options after each race. You can watch as characters full of personality laugh at each other, challenge each other, stare at each other in disdain. It's funny, it's quirky, and it's exactly the sort of thing that makes Nintendo games memorable.

The single-player mode is fun enough, but it lacks in secrets, cameos, ""wow"" moments, and the assorted mix of cool stuff that makes solo experiences memorable. It's nice both as an evergreen game for quick-burst sessions (something the Wii U lacked beforehand) and for getting the gist of controls in order to not embarrass yourself in the mode that is real reason this game is great: the multiplayer.

As anyone who ever played any Mario Kart before will attest, this is the ultimate local multiplayer experience right here. It's fun, it's chaotic, but it's also very nuanced and incredibly reliant on skill. It's the sort of game anyone can pick up and play, especially in lower difficulties, but it takes quite a while to master. Online multiplayer also impresses: it's the best it's ever been in any Nintendo game, with robust tournament options. The one letdown is battle mode, which takes place in actual tracks rather than custom-built arenas. Let's hope future downloadable content fixes this, as this is a mode that used to take quite a chunk of my gaming time in previous instalments.

As one of Nintendo's premier franchises, Mario Kart once again impresses and offers one of the most universal reasons yet to get a Wii U. The quality is definitely here, and the focus on multiplayer means it's a game that will likely last for the entire console generation, making it a very easy buy.

GoombaJMR,14-07-2015,"Nintendo strikes gold again with Mario Kart 8, making me roll back into the groove of the Mario Kart Franchise. In terms of hour-counts, I've put around 500+ on MKDS, 70 on MKWii, and 90 on MK7, and MK8 is quickly rolling to the 20 hour mark. I've felt that this game's just got so much polish everywhere. The gameplay itself in races is perfectly solid, and the item use is almost perfectly balanced. The coins are great, new items are alright, and the music is definitely pretty good. I have a small gripe on the battle mode, and am a bit disappointed that it hasn't returned to infinite-time battles seen in Mario Kart DS. It isn't too big of a problem though, and the positives instantly outweigh the negatives. The online components are okay, but really good in terms of Nintendo's online systems. I feel that Mario Kart 8 does a good job with everything, and the DLC is just worth the money with all that good stuff. The game isn't exactly that long, but the replay value is pretty good. Also, I am somewhat disappointed with the lack of variety for the character roster we have for this game. Baby counterparts for many characters, 7 whole slots (instead of repaints) for the koopa kids is somewhat of a waste (I believe), and other random counterparts like tanooki mario are a bit unnecessary. I would have liked to see the return of some characters, including Dry Bones, King Boo, or maybe some new characters like the Goomba. Either way, the game is solid - definitely worth all your money

Greenicey,14-07-2014,"There's not a lot to say that hasn't already been said. This is one of those rare games that I do feel deserve a 10/10. First off, while the gameplay is extremely similar to any other recent mario kart game, the balance has been completely reworked. It's still not perfect, but hardcore gamers are bound to enjoy this almost as much as a casual one. Battle mode has been changed so that you now battle on actual tracks, it's weird, confusing at first, but eventually I warmed up to it and may play it when I'm bored of racing. As virtually every other reviewer has stated this game is absolutely gorgeous. It definitely rivals anything the other systems have out there currently, the zoom in shots especially exemplify this. Nintendo has never really been one for graphically powerful systems or games, but they definitely should be it's that good. Will this game save the Wii U? Probably not, but it sure is the kick in the pants that it needs right now.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
HawkeyeWii,26-11-2014,Easily one of the best Mario Kart games and still one of the best games released from this new generation of consoles. It looks gorgeous and plays so smooth.

Carlsdil000,05-02-2015,"Mario Kart Wii U takes almost everything about Mario Kart Wii and makes it even better. The levels and detail are absolutely gorgeous. Mario Kart is finally in HD and it is breathtakingly beautiful. The level design can get a tad chaotic at times with karts zooming in many different directions and even upside down at times, but they are still a lot of fun to race on.
This time around you don't have to worry so much about constantly being hit with items like in Mario Kart Wii, as it appears that missile items such as shells and slippery bananas have been scaled back a little in favor of more ""helpful"" items such as mushrooms and coins.

Using a Wii U controller vs a Wii Remote takes a while to get used to. I feel like the Wii Remote is better suited for a game like this than a small tablet controller, but I eventually got used to it.

Overall it's a great Mario Kart experience, one that you should not miss out on!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
knifeandfork,27-10-2014,"Before the gravity mechanic of MK8 was revealed, I expected it to be just another Mario Kart game, with few actual new ideas. But I was proven wrong. In Mario Kart 8, Nintendo has created their best Mario Kart in years. There's an abundance of ideas in this new entry, which makes it a joy to play.

One of the most exciting things about MK8 is the fact we're finally getting a Mario Kart in HD. And it doesn't disappoint. The game looks amazing, constantly throwing in another welcome visual surprise. Mount Wario, for example, is a wondrous sight. The visuals in it are varied all the way through and you'll see a variety of views. What about Sunshine Airport? This intricately crafted track has you crossing a wide variety of terrain, with the visual spectacle of seeing a plane soar above you as you glide to the end of each lap. It's clear that there are a lot of points in the game which serve the purpose to simply amaze you visually again and again. With the fluid animations and crystal-clear graphics, it's impossible to complain about the visual side of things at all. What's more, the new anti-gravity mechanic makes it even more spectacular. You'll see things you never thought you's see in a Mario Kart game.

But what about the sound? Simply put, it's wonderful. Much of the music is recorded live, giving a much richer quality than in past Mario Kart games. All the various pieces are excellent, contributing to the polish of MK8.

However, the graphics and sound are merely an afterthought compared to MK8's revolutionary gameplay. Though gliders, kart customisation and all the rest of it return, the focus is on the brand-new mechanic that changes everything: anti-gravity. You can drive up walls, upside down, up a waterfall, and more. This new mechanic is used in many ways, and apart from the visusl thrill of driving upside down, it grants the gameplay a lot too. In Toad's Turnpike- which is actually a remake of the N64 version- you get the choice of driving on the walls the whole time, or staying on the road. This gives gameplay a whole new strategy. Also, when driving in anti-gravity, slamming into another racer doesn't slow you down, it instead gives you a speed boost. This means that now, even if you're playing as Mini Mario, you'll want to hit Bowser or DK to get that speed boost, completely overturning everything we knew about Mario Kart. Of course, MK8's other big innovation is Mario Kart TV- a feature that creates highlight reels of a race, with impressive camera angles, slow motion and the ability to edit the reel. You can then share these short videos on Miiverse and Youtube, a pleasant surprise from a tentative company when it comes to online. MKTV works well with anti-gravity because during gameplay, the camera still stays right behind you when you go upside down, meaning you still see it from the racer's perspective. However, MKTV shows the highlights from other camera angles, so you'll see your racer on their side or upside down- an impressive sight. On the whole, MKTV is an excelent addition which gives you the chance to share the best moments with friends.

As for the multiplayer in MK8, it's a lot of fun. It's disappointing that you still have to play split-screen in spite of the Gamepad, but multiplayer is so fun that's easily forgivable. Online is great, with the well thought out voting system making a return so that a variety of courses can be played. There's no voice chat during play, and I wish you could type messages yourself between races, but the online is nevertheless solid.

So far, I've been very positive about the game, though there are a few small complaints I have. The fact the Gamepad has the map is no longer a flaw since the update, so I can count that one out. However, the amount of characters you can play as is small. I appreciate the inclusion of the Koopalings, but overall the roster is underwhelming. And the less said about MK8's horrendous battle mode, the better. It was an enjoyable distraction from the main game in previous MK titles, but in this one, the battle stages have inexplicably been replaced by ordinary tracks, making it a mundane experience.

These are small flaws when compared to the quality of the majority of the game. MK8 is one of the best entries in the series, with some of the most innovative game design I've seen in years and an impressive feature enabling you to share highlight reeks of races. Despite a couple of odd slip-ups, it's an outstanding game overall.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Dadrik,09-04-2017,"Incredible graphics, even for the WiiU, amazing gameplay, great musics, lots of content...

MW1AA2Gs,14-07-2014,"Mario Kart to me at least is a series which with every new release they completely annihilate the last one and make it so that there's no reason to ever back track (the exception being super circuit) to a previous title and yet there are still a few things in the old games which keep them in most Nintendo fans libraries even when they're more then ten years old... And guess what they did it again. Mario Kart 8 does a lot of new things for the series like zero gravity (which by the way isn't disorienting and unbelievably smooth), the new crazy eight item (which can really help catch you up if you messed up and ended up in the back), the horn (which FINALLY ends the terror of the blue shell... most of the time), and tons of more cart customizations. In terms of presentation it is perfect... literally, the tracks look unbelievable and the music is beautiful on some tracks. The character roster is great with tons of new characters and old ones (but does feel a little lazy sometimes). Overall the game is unbelievably well made and reminds me why we should always expect good games from Nintendo.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

FogCityRoller,26-11-2015,"It's really, REALLY difficult saying this but...this might just be the best Mario Kart game ever made. I'm an '80s and '90s kid, so I actually grew up on the original on SNES. In fact, the very first time I stayed up all night was the Christmas my parents got us Mario Kart. It feels wrong to buck the original from the top of the rankings in favor of the most recent title but this is really a spectacular game. I'm not here to post my rankings where each Mario Kart title stands, but I just grinned like an idiot for hours while playing this one and the online play is pretty amazing.

To make it even better, the DLC for Mario Kart is probably a contender for the best DLC ever released for a game. I know the DLC has its own rating page, but the fact that it wasn't overpriced serves as another bonus point for the main title.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Soccerdude00,11-09-2014,"A throughly excellent addition to my now growing Wii U library, Mario Kart 8 is without a doubt a worthwhile purchase. The game uses the Wii U's graphics to great effect, creating wonderful settings for whipping around the course with your favorite Mario mascot. Retro courses are well designed. But the new courses are exciting as well. Battles are a disappointment, however. Instead of a small, compact, brand new/retro arena like Mario Kart Wii among others, you instead just race around the same courses you use for multiplayer and single player. This is the only reason why I didn't give this game a ten. Online mode is outstanding, with connection speeds that are fast and lag doesn't exist. Here's hoping they use online this well in the new Smash Bros!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Half the time in first you get the worthless coin item, and you can not cycle through items like you can in previous games(i.e. have one item in your item box and dragging one behind you). I find every time I race, I stay in 1st-3rd place, and then get hit by multiple items at the end that brings me down to 6th or lower. They tried to make up for this with the super horn being able to destroy blue shells, but you never get it in first place.

This is a game I pick up at least once a week on my own, and even more so if friends are over, or if I'm playing online with my family abroad. Simply put, it is by far the greatest Mario Kart ever made.

BROstoise,07-08-2014,"10/10 best Mario Kart. Stunning visuals, racetracks filled to the brim with creativity, and transformations from Mario Kart 7 have been perfected.

There were 2 complaints: the coin item, and the ability to only carry one item.
Several times, I found myself wishing for a coin, since the ones on the race track usually arent along the inner-most curve, also known as the fastest route.

Constantly holding down the left shoulder button to have 2 items gave me hand cramps. The pain is gone now because I can only hold one item anyway.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SableSoldi3r,12-10-2017,"Mario Kart 8 is everything you should come to expect from a next-gen Mario Kart title. The visuals are beautiful: graphics are very detailed, and courses are colorful and eye-catching. The gameplay is nothing new for Mario Kart, as it employs all of the mechanics from previous games while new additions are minimal, ranging from a few new power-ups to some new kart customizations. Making a return from Super Mario Kart and Mario Kart 7 are coins, which add some variety to the game and allows for some ""fun along the way"" as you try to grab coins to cap out your max speed. The revamped courses are gorgeous and very nostalgic, and the remixed music was a blast from the past. My personal favorites are N64's Rainbow Road, SNES's Donut Plains 3 and Wii's Moo Moo Meadows.

One minor complaint I have about this game is the item balance, both in quality and quantity. First: one of the new items unleashes a piranha plant that frantically snaps its mouth, giving you speed boosts, nabbing nearby coins and knocking out opponents in the process. Although you only typically acquire the piranha plant when you're towards the bottom of the board, it seems a bit overpowered and does a lot for one power-up.

Second: just like in Mario Kart Wii, Mario Kart 8 increases the number of concurrent racers from eight to twelve, which drastically increases the number of items on-screen. When I first picked the game up, I immediately jumped into 150cc Grand Prix. Being a veteran of the series, I've done this before with previous entries to challenge myself and was able to get accustomed fairly quickly. In just about every race this time around, I was in first place for more than half a race, ahead by a considerable distance, and then out of the blue I got hit with an assortment of three or four different shells that sets me back at least eight places and left me to finish the race in fourth at best. For a game that requires you to get first on all four races in a cup in order to get the best award for that cup, this is infuriating and incredibly frustrating. You can do everything right in a race (drifting, drafting, hitting speed boosts, doing tricks off every jump, collecting ten coins, etc.), only to be barraged with shells at the very last second and to be thrown into sixth place, forcing you to restart the entire cup and ultimately resulting in a waste of time. It feels like, no matter what you do, this game doesn't reward skill but simply gives you a slight chance of having a three-star rating fall into your lap, which honestly isn't fun in the slightest.

Items aside, this game is very fun to play with friends and it's a very refreshing Mario Kart experience. Just don't expect to have much fun if you're in it even remotely for the achievement.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

dinosauryoshi,10-08-2014,"The best Mario Kart since the N64 era. The end. Well actually that’s not the end, here’s the full review;

On the gameplay front this is the best Mario Kart yet. The physics feel deeper and the karts feel so fun and smooth to drive. The anti-gravity works really well and I love the addition of the spin boost especially. I also think the new weapons are great and add something new. I even like the coin item as it means the leader can’t always bank on getting something to hang off their backside and protect them as they zoom to victory, I do however wish it appeared a little less frequently. Now only being able to hold one item at a time was also a good move in my opinion for similar reasons, the leader can’t have two protective items at once and is always at least a little vulnerable.

Visually it looks good enough to eat (particularly the candy track). This (along with Mario 3D World) is one of the best looking games I’ve ever played and it truly feels ‘next gen’, a great display of what the Wii U can do. The amount of detail put into each of the tracks and backgrounds is wonderful, more than you’ll ever pick-up while zooming along. It’s a colourful visual feast throughout. The frame rate is a rock solid and smooth 60hz,only dropping in 3 or 4 player local play and the music played by a live band really adds energy to each track and brings the whole experience to life.

There’s plenty of content too. 32 tracks, 16 of which are new and all of which are great. Not a dud in the bunch. The 16 retro tracks have been so well done and changed to accommodate the new anti-grav and/or underwater elements that they feel almost like new tracks themselves. The battle mode however leaves a little to be desired due to the lack of battle arenas and use of a variety of the tracks instead. This is still quite fun but gets boring quickly and the addition of some arenas really would have improved this mode no end. There are plenty of characters to choose from but the roster is a little samey and the lack of Diddy Kong is a particular shame. One has to mention the brilliant and well balanced vehicle customisations though which offer a lot of variety and are a lot of fun to play around with to find your preferred combination of kart/bike, wheels, and glider.

The single player won’t take a seasoned pro long to complete and is made up of the usual 50, 100, and 150cc and mirror modes across 16 cups of varying difficulty but it’s in multiplayer where this game shines, particularly with the new refined online experience. The frame rate drops noticeably when over two players play locally which is a shame but is to be expected and this doesn’t stop the game being fun at all. It just loses a little of it’s polish. The online is magnificent. Tournaments allow for custom rulesets and times for tournaments to be open. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed being able to join in on tournaments from my favourite online publications (Nintendo life etc) and to my experience the races run completely smoothly with lag a rare occurrence. Having 12 racers on the track from all over the world hurling shells at each other is honestly some of the most amazing fun I’ve had playing a video game in recent times, if not ever! Being able to play 2 player online is an excellent addition too.

In conclusion this is easily the best Mario Kart since 64 with the only things holding it back from a perfect score being the lack of battle arenas, the slightly disappointing roster and the over prevalence of the coin item. All in all Mario Kart 8 is some of the best fun you could ever have on a console. It really is that good. Drop dead gorgeous, thrilling gameplay and a rock solid and fun online mode make this a game I’ll be playing for a long, long time.

it is. I picked up Mario Kart 8 the day it released
and didn't put it down tell I had beat all tracks
on 150cc. Then once you do that...You unlock all the
tracks in reverse! Leaving you with tons of races to
try and beat. The game also has a great online multilayer
letting you play 2 players online with one system. Online
has tournaments and a full ranking system to. The Graphics
to the game are some of the nicest I have seen on the Wii-U
since Super Mario 3D World. I find the game just about
perfect, I have only a few problems with the game. I
find the difficulty in the later races can be unfair
and very aggravating. Also would have been nice to see
more playable characters, seems like they filled the game
with Baby versions of main characters and all the Koopa Kids.

isasif826,02-08-2014,"Oh Mario Kart, you will always be great fun no matter what medium you are experienced in.

The New Mario Kart 8, is a very fun and exiting addition to the Wii U console. With more characters and cars to choose from, there is plenty of fun to be had. The new tracks feel fresh but perhaps not as memorable as previous tracks such as rainbow road from GC, or music park 3DS. The new Graphics are fantastic, and the New item system brings a different playing field in terms of strategy and difficulty, that has not been seen in previous installments. This game really makes you focus on how well you can race, as opposed to how lucky you get with items.

Overall I will say this game is an 8, but only because it lacks a strong Battle system, which in my opinion, is one of the most fun features of a Mario Kart game. I would gladly sacrifice character and kart variation for some decent battle stages but that is just me. All in all, You will not be disappointed with Mario Kart 8.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
AuroreZell,07-08-2014,"This is by far the best Mario kart game released up to this point. My only real complaint about this game are some the of characters, and that's just nitpicking. The online feature works great and its a lot of fun to test your skills against other players. I would say that its worth getting a Wii U just to play this game, thats how much fun it is.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fruit-Dragon,07-08-2014,"I really loved this game. Like, really. This is the kind of game that shows off how great the console truly is, and it does it beautifully as well. Although it doesn't goes as fast as it could (it still goes fast, though) it makes up with it for it's truly amazing graphics. This game shows off how powerful a Wii U is (it's even adding DLC to make better in the future, and an update is coming soon) and it does it in the best way possible. 10/10 would play again.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JudeMattingly,13-08-2014,"Wonderful level design, amazing color palate, but a less than average character roster. Loading screens for a Mario Kart is odd as well. Great game overall just not as good as Double Dash.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Nickname,20-08-2014,"It might be fun if you play it casually, but if you really wanna play the game seriously online and aim for 1st place it's horrible. But this game has it's bright sides, so I'll adress these first. The visuals are gorgeus, by far the best-looking Wii U game yet. They even managed to bring the Koopalings unique personalities just by their animations. The game also runs at 60 frames per seconds unless you're driving in 3- or 4-Player mode, there's only 30 fps. The soundtrack is also great and memorable, especially the new renditions of the retro tracks' music are great. My only complaint is that the whistles on the remake of SNES Donut Plains 3 are missing except you're in 1st, but that's an extremely minor complaint. The Retro courses were remade really well and sometimes look like whole new courses. Only complaint is that few courses use the anti-gravity feature to its best. Memorable are only the Water Park loop, the spinning Mario Circuit and the few (often optional) sections where you drive on the walls while others stay on the ground, like in Thwomp Ruins or Toad's Turnpike, a returning track from Mario Kart 64. Also, all new tracks use Anti-Gravity atleast once and all Retro tracks use atleast one of Gliding, Diving and Anti-Gravity, new features introduced in Mario Kart 7 and 8. Rainbow Road is also a pretty huge letdown. Many expected a track that twists and turns all around the place like the Wario Colloseum track back on Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, but it's pretty linear and the coolest thing about it is where the track splits into two paths and you can jump from one to another to cut distance. But in the end, the track design is pretty solid and tracks like the disco stage Electrodrome and the adventurous and extremely diverse track Mount Wario are already fan favorites. The Single Player is what you'd expect from a Mario Kart game, GPs to unlock characters and vehicle parts ,returning from Mario Kart 7, Time Trials to compete for the best times on courses, VS races with custom rules and battle. Battle is the first big letdown since you battle on courses instead of arenas, but since I don't battle too often, it's not too big of a letdown for me. Offlien Multiplayer is one of the most fun parts of the game, since you can just drive casually with friends and family. Next is the roster, which has cut many fan favorite characters like Diddy Kong, King Boo or Dry Bones in favor of a golden reskin of Peach and a baby version of Rosalina, and all 7 Koopalings. While I miss Dry Bones, the Koopalings are more diverse then expected and fun to use. Online's features are neat but limited. Mario Kart TV leta you upload videos of your races to YouTube, but only 1 Minute highlights and you can't edit camera angles or anything. Tournaments are an evolution of MK7's communities, now you can edit the time where it goes, restrict characters etc. Only letdown is that tournaments can't be all day and have to pause for 1 hour daily. But now, for the online play. If you don't know what online play is, it's basically like offline racing, but you race against players from around the globe and gain ""VR"" for racing ""BR"" for battling. But unlike in Mario Kart Wii where it mostly showed a player's skill, in Mario Kart 8 it shows for how long you've been playing. Max VR is 9999 like in Mario Kart Wii, but you start at 1000 VR (you started at 5000 VR in Mario Kart Wii) and VR growth is slow... You don't lose about any VR on losing and gain not much, so it'll most likely take you a long time to gain VR. In Mario Kart Wii, however, you can lose your VR very fast. You mostly balance out at one number after enough races, and mostly keep it along with your skill level. But the biggest dread, the items. Maio Kart Wii was mostly criticised for rubber banding, but I think Mario Kart 8's item balance is even worse. Coin is mostly the most common item you get in 1st. This makes an incoming red shell as dangerous as a blue shell, especially since both slow you down about the same time. The most dangerous items? Shocks and Bananas. Why? Because Shells don't kick you around and put your speed at 0 anymore, while Bananas make you spin for an awfully long time. There are no invincibility frames after getting hit, so after a hitz prepare for many hits, since you can't do anything while flipping, but enemies still can hit you. THAT'S what kills all possible fun for me. You can't even be sure to get revenge after falling behind, since even in 10th Bananas or Triple Green Shells aren't too rare. The item system is horrible, and as someone that actually wants to do GOOD this doesn't help, neither does the fat you can only hold one item.

So, while playing it for fun is good, you can get super frustrated if you try to really play the game for ding good. So if you're okay with getting hit for unfair reasons, go buy this game! If you wanna play a fair game, play Mario Kart Wii online via the Custom Server ""Wiimmfi"" instead.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Justin7387100,25-08-2014,This game is freaking amazing! One of the best games and best looking on the wii u. This game alone made the wii u jump start all over again! But anyways lets get on to the review! Mario Kart 8 is hands down the best game i have ever played. It has stunning graphics and great tracks and controls are great! The items are a little sad this time around. When you are in first you'll get a coin alot. Online play is amazing but just be prepared for the really good Japan players.

BariothGuy,09-09-2014,"This is the perfect Mario Kart game. There's a ton of new gameplay mechanics and content but it still feels like Mario Kart. Even after you do everything you can in the single player modes and your friends/siblings get bored and want something different, you still can go online and race other people. The average player could get around 50 hours of gameplay out of it, but with new content on the way there's even more fun to be had. The only flaw are the battle mode tracks, but Nintendo will probably fix that too. A Wii U must have.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fboogey,11-09-2014,"The best Mario Kart ever (maybe with the exception of the first Mario Kart that started it all) and the best carting game out there period and the most fun racer out there.

IrontreeStudios,16-09-2014,"Mario Kart 8 is great! The inverted gravity mechanic that the developers added put a fun spin on the already fun game play. The creative track designs and seemingly never ending Kart upgrades keeps players wanting to stay in the game for more. As we all know, Nintendo needs to beef up their online play, which is the only reason I didn't score this game as a solid 10. I just wish I had more friends with a Wii U.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
tommyboy247,15-10-2014,"Now I was a huge fan for Mario Kart Wii. It was intense, colourful and took great advantage of the Wii motion controllers, however its home console successor was a bit of a disappointment because in every tournament its really scripted and repetitive when the same a.i. end up in the same position every time, its really really frustrating hat the Wii U gamepad is really awkward to use as a motion controller so you just have to use the standard controller which is really boring, you can use the wii remote but anyone who didnt own a Wii before hand or didnt buy a remote with the system will have to stick with the boring gamepad, and the last problem is paid DLC. Now this game isnt all bad, it can still be fun because its georgus visuals, great soundtrack, fun online sessions, brillient level design and when its not repeditive its really thrilling.
Thats my review for Mario Kart 8. I wish Nintendo did more for this game.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Linkruleshyrule,03-10-2014,This game is great graphics are out of this world Amazing!

StrippuhGenes,04-11-2014,"I was never really a fan of the Mario Kart series. I bought the Wii U for Zelda Wind Waker HD and for the future Smash Bros. I bought Mario Kart 8 because of the split screen and the hype around it. In all honesty, I was blown away by the game play. The silky smooth frame rate, the amazing graphics, and the game play caught me by surprise.

dkxcalibur,05-11-2014,"The best in the series for sure! One of the best games on the Wii U for sure! One of the best looking games on any system!

The tracks are brilliantly designed and each one feels unique. The tracks are bright, colorful, and beautiful. The music that accompanies each track is perfect and you'll have them stuck in your head for days. I believe they are performed by an orchestra. Every character that you care about from the world of Mario are present. I could have done with less baby characters and a few more Mario enemies but they don't take away from anything. The controls are perfect. I prefer the classic style of control but the motion control is included and has been improved upon Mario Kart Wii's motion controls. The online features have also been improved and there are a lot more options when racing online then in past games from the series.

Since release, it's been announced that DLC is on the way that will bring Link and Animal Crossing characters; and both additional track and karts to the game in the future.

Stop questioning if the Wii U has games. Buy a Wii U and buy this game!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kahisys,10-11-2014,"Nintendo kept a good path and created another Mario Kart that'd remain a must-buy for its system. It holds to the series by making a hectic racing game with gorgeous and/or fun tracks to play through. We get what we ask for : sense of mess, speed and fun.

Enhanced with the quicker reload of the item boxes, it is easier to get items to beat others with...or to be beat with. The new tracks are damn fun and very well put together, and the remakes of the old ones fit well the new gimmick of this opus, which is the anti-gravity racing. Said gimmick is also worth noticing as it allows a new point of view on racing, making you bump into other racers to get a speed boost instead of avoiding them as usual.

The online is a big part of the game, and of course it's well organized, making it easy to join whenever you wish to get some challenge from across the world, either against strangers or your friends. Sadly I can't review on the quality of the connection since mine is naturally very bad.

Some would complain about the lack of character diversity, which I could get behind, but it's not dramatic or that much of a bother. Also, the anti-gravity isn't that much noticeable since the camera always adapts to you. Those details are just a bit of nitpicking.

2 DLCs are planned so far, for a price that is very correct seing it adds in total 4 more cups. Nintendo seems to know how to balance their prices on DLCs.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
sanluis20,10-11-2014,"Mario Kart makes it long awaited appearance in HD and this game doesn't disappoint.

TrueIcee,20-12-2014,"Mario Kart 8 isn't really anything new, but it still makes a fun racer for the whole family to enjoy from time to time. The tracks are really great, mainly thanks to the new Anti-Gravity gimmick that ties the whole function of Mario Kart 7 together. I think that I should mention that this game's presentation is top notch. It looks very nice, while running at 60 FPS with one or two players, online included.

The 32 Tracks shouldn't leave you bored, especially with some really good new tracks, like the Electrodrome and Mount Wario, and even fan favorite N64 Rainbow Road makes it's return.

That doesn't mean this game isn't without it's problems. Honestly, this game's roster is easily one of the worst of a Mario Kart game. Half of the game's 30 characters are just clones of others, and fan favorites like Diddy and Birdo are missing. Function wise, the Coin power-up can completely break the item balance, ultimately dooming the person in 1st even more so then ever, Super Horn or not. The online may not be perfect, but for the most part it runs rather well, but be prepared for some random disconnects once in a blue moon.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a good racing experience for the Wii U. I highly recommend it.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

DBPirate1129,10-01-2015,"As a big fan of the past two installments in the series, you'd probably be able to imagine how excited I was for Mario Kart 8. I was even more excited to discover that Mario Kart 8 surpassed my expectations by a long shot.

The courses in the game are the best yet, both new and old. The new anti-gravity mechanic adds a breath of fresh air to the races. Add to that the gliding and underwater sections from MK7 and you've got yourself some of the best courses in any racing game ever made. Particular standouts include Toad Harbor, Shy Guy Falls, every course from the Star Cup, Cloudtop Cruise, Bowser's Castle, and Rainbow Road. The music is also simply fantastic. It can't be denied it's the best music in the series yet.

The character roster still isn't as good as Wii but at this point, who cares? It does everything else bigger and better! I was much more engaged in the kart customization than I was in 7 with more parts to choose from. I'm still not a fan of the 10-coin limit but it doesn't ruin the game as a whole. It's nice to see bikes return as I usually raced on them more than in karts in MKWii.

Mario Kart 8 shows off the best online in the series with superb connection, a great new course voting system, and the genius new addition of Mario Kart TV. Mario Kart TV allows you to view your highlights or entire races and do lots of cool stuff with them like putting it in slow-motion. The glorious visuals really shine thanks to this addition. The only true downside in the game is battle mode which is a massive downgrade compared to Wii and 7. Instead of racing on battle arenas, you race on actual courses which is a shame.

Overall, Mario Kart 8 is the best installment in the series yet. It's hard to imagine how it can get any better. The courses, online, vehicles, and new mechanics in the game are simply gold.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Stroot,05-02-2015,This is a great game and a must-own for the Wii U. The online racing experience is smooth and the courses are a fun mix of new and updated classics. The only major complaint is the lack of battle mode arena courses. Instead of creating battle mode arena courses Nintendo decided to just make the regular courses available for battle mode. Seems like a lazy move by Nintendo and probably the result of needing to meet a deadline. It doesn't completely take away from the main experience of the game play and still receives a very high score.,9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Supermoose,31-05-2015,"This is an amazing game! The Mariokart gameplay is better than ever with new items and mechanics. The new ""anti-gravity"" mechanic may seem gimmicky and useless, but it actually changes the gameplay quite a bit. Most if not all of the courses are really good, Mount Wario being a personal favorite. The music is awesome, and the DLC is also really great. And despite being on the less powerful Wii U, this game is still prettier to look at than most games out. The one negative to this game is battle mode, which gets rid of the arena-style battle courses of the previous games, and instead uses the race tracks for battles. it is a minor flaw when compared to the rest of the game. But other than that the game is fantastic.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Gold_Grande,08-03-2017,"Mario Kart 8 is a release that tries to bring many new things to the Mario Kart franchise. With a great online scene, there is always something to do. The stages and courses look better than ever and the soundtrack is top of the line. But while those things are terrific, the game tries a bit too much with the zero gravity driving and the paragliding. I feel like I have much less control over my kart compared to previous titles. I do not think those additions where refined enough. The item roulette is pretty bad in the game with distribution of items being weird. Blue shell not being able to fly feels like a minus. Nevertheless, it's an enjoyable game but not one I'd marry. I'm happy to give this a 6/10. Decent.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
MEJO86,30-03-2015,"Very well made racing game with awesome graphics! Nice tracks and a variety of veichles to choose from. The driver rooster could have been better where you have characters such as Baby Mario/Luigi/Peach/Daisy/Rosalina, Metal Mario and last but not least Pink gold Peach instead of say Diddy Kong, Hammer bro or Birdo. But apart from that the rooster is fine (but why is Donkey Kong a cruiser weight?). The balance of items are fixed which means you won't get a blue shell up your *ss as soon as you are in first place.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Brandonthegamer,08-04-2015,"Mario Kart is the one of the games that are still fun even if they release in every console. It does not matter is a game gets too many sequels as long it is still entertaining. I suggest to finish this game and then use the online mode to test out your skills. Mario Kart is like Super Smash Bros mainly because you will still find competition online and even find some streams on twitch to interact with. Fun for friends, family, and strangers.

2cben,07-09-2015,"A great game, it is fast, fun and pretty. If you like Mario kart buying a Wii U just for this game is worth it. The online mode (sadly not perfect but I'll come to that later) will give you hundreds of hour of game time.

What I like:
- There are so much details put in most of tracks it is just insane! Some tracks are definitely better than others though.
- It's really smooth, the framerate does not see any drop in 1 player mode. in 3 or 4 players it feels really slow at the beginning and then you get use to it.
- It's a complete delight to drive, the control feels very good and responsive.
- Items are better balanced than in Mario kart Wii even if I would personally reduce the likelyhood of getting strong item (a little less red/blue shells, stars ...)

The following change in online mode would be VERY welcome:

- Your online score does not mean that much, something more like the World of warcraft pvp arena rating (at least the way it used to be at the beginning) would be much better.
- Along side your score a few stats would be very welcome. Like your average position, how many races in total played, I would love to know that the dude who's been beating me for the last half hour actually played 100000 races (or actually 10!)
- Being able to pick from 4 races is not enough and seriously is it purely random??? I feel like some races NEVER appear.

One last thing, more DLC please!",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

elephantmobber,22-06-2015,Definitely a very large part of why I purchased a Wii U. This game is phenomenal. It is very inventive for the eighth game in a seemingly endless series.

UltraTektite,26-08-2015,"Mario Kart 8 isn't revolutionary, but it's without a doubt the most polished and graphically impressive Mario Kart game to date. It's not the new items, new characters, or anti gravity gimmick that make this game great, but the absolutely beautiful graphics and detail, great online mode, and the return of the beloved Mario Kart formula. The only big disappointment was battle mode which sucks now, but that blow was softened by the fact that nobody expected a ton from it because MKWii's and MK7's battle modes were already not as good as those of their predecessors.

In conclusion Mario Kart 8's main selling feature (the anti grav) really didn't add much to the game, but that didn't stop the outstanding gameplay and graphics from making this game a worthwhile buy for any Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It's controls are perfects, it's visuals sublime, and it is without a doubt the best selection of levels, made all the more sweeter with the best DLC packs any game has ever offered. It's new features all turn out to be excellent additions to the series and the weapon selection is by the best and most balanced.
Online play works brilliantly and you are likely to spend most of your time playing online.
Mario Kart 8 is a work of craftsmanship which makes most other AAA titles look unrefined and amateurish.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Sound: The soundtrack is a mix of pop, jazz and rock, and it's extremely catchy.

Gameplay: The new items and vehicles make the game easy to play.

Multiplayer/Extras: Tons of tracks and vehicle customization options. The online mode is fun too, with you having the ability to share your replays on YouTube.

Cosmozerk,26-02-2016,"This without a doubt this is the best Mario Kart there has ever been.
STORY: NONE watsoever.

PRESENTATION: Man, this game is just a pleasure to look at, the 60fps, 1080p, the weather and lighting effects, the moddeles, the animations, the music, pretty much everything in mario kart 8 is great looking and well done.

GAMEPLAY: The item and character balance is the best in the entire series, the CPU doesn't cheat, the new items are very fun to use, the new courses are awesome, the modes 50cc, 100cc, 150cc, mirrorcc and the new 200cc are all as fun as they always were and the online work's very well, the only 2 issues i have with the game is the battle mode, which takes place in normal arenas, making it easy to not even see your opponent and the roster, even with the dlc, the roster is not the best, there are so many baby characters, and koopalinks, and marios, and peachs, etc, i mean seriously, why cut diddy kong or dry bones, or why not add more original characters like Captain Falcon, Sonic, Pac-man, etc, i mean the roster is not terrible, like is good to see some animal crossing characters, and link from the legend of zelda, but you still have to buy those characters (don't get me wrong, the dlc in this game is sweet, but....still).
Overall mario kart 8 is nearly a perfect game and if nintendo decides to do a dlc pack 3 which added more characters like the one's i mentioned and fix the battle mode then i would not doubt to give this game a 10/10, but as it stands mario kart 8 gets a 9/10",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
SuperMatt777,12-12-2015,"Mario Kart 8 plays as good as it looks. The courses are not only dynamic, but a pleasure to look at, with all of them filled with detail. Even the retro tracks look beautiful with their nice re-designs. The roster of characters is a bit of a mix, having an equal amount of interesting adds (such as the Koopalings) and pointless adds (such as Baby Rosalina and Pink Gold Peach). While it was nice that the kart part unlocking criteria wasn't nearly as time consuming as it was in Mario Kart 7, I still think that there could've been a better method. All in all, I'd highly recommend Mario Kart 8 to any Wii U owner.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Zorua,04-02-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is easily the best Wii U game out there. A fantastic combination of fun racing but challenging courses, the Mario Kart series has always been popular with a certain breed of gamers. Mario Kart 8 is easily the best out of all the entries in the series, with stunning HD graphics, fun and interesting new items and characters, and challenging courses creating a fantastic hybrid of genres for the Wii U title.
First off, character selection. Everyone's favourite veterans return, with the likes of Mario, Luigi, Peach, Donkey Kong, Bowser and many more taking to the track once again, though there are some characters that perhaps should've been included but were ultimately left out. A whole range of new characters such as the Koopalings and Baby Rosalina also add new characters for you to race with, though some characters *cough cough Pink Gold Peach* are quite bizarre and in my opinion don't deserve a spot over the likes of Diddy Kong or Bowser Jr.
Nintendo have also introduced a whole new range of items, which include the Super Horn, Piranha Plant and Boomerang, as well as Coins returning from Mario Kart 7. As is traditional with the Mario Kart series, a whole new host of courses are introduced, which also incorporate the new anti-gravity feature, which allows for a F-Zero-like experience. There are also a whole new range of Retro courses from previous Mario Kart games which give you a blast to the past to the likes of Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and Mario Kart DS.
Overall, Mario Kart 8 is a highly fun game that only gets better when playing online or with friends. Two lots of DLC have also been released, which add characters, karts, and courses, and although I would've liked to seen maybe Diddy Kong or Bowser Jr. in one of this packs, there could still be more. The only criticism I have with this game is the Battle Mode, with Battle Mode instead being played on regular courses, which massively nerfs it. Apart from that, the game is one of the best I've played, and I'd recommend to buy a Wii U just to play it.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Djungelorm,27-09-2016,"This game is easily the weakest in the series in my opinion.
Playing offline multiplayer is when Mario Kart 8 is at its best, and is still fun. The graphics are great and the track design, when taking into account the redesigned retro tracks, is the best in the series, with antigravity allowing for more freedom and possibilities in track design, for example driving down a waterfall or along the side of a building.
Now for a note on battle mode.. This time around you battle on racetracks, which can make it hard to find opponents. The worst thing, however, is the absence of a coin / shine collection battle mode - you can only do balloon battles.
There is one glaring flaw with Mario Kart 8, however: the item system, which seems as though it has been designed to ruin the fun for all competitive players. Getting powerful items like triple red shells in second place is now likely, and since you are forbidden from dangling one item while storing another in reserve, the leader has no defense and will inevitably be killed, and most likely fall to the back, hence minimizing the skill in winning a race. Seriously, I would say race performance is about 20% skill and 80% luck (on average), which is fine when you're playing with friends, but not when you're playing online, trying to improve your ranking.
If you're playing for fun with family or friends, this game is ideal and guaranteed to give you a fun experience. But if you, like me are competitive and serious about playing online at a high level, this is not the game for you.

Arilio,20-08-2016,"This game is pure perfection. Everything about it is amazing. The course design is so creative and the add of antigravity feature makes some awsome levels. The soundtrack is just great and many of the old tracks got a little bit changed. I see many people that are saying that the remake of rainbow road from mario kart 64 is terrible. I definitely disagree with that. The original was so long and boring. In the remake the backround, the music and the 3 sections instead of laps are great. Also the add of DLC and 200cc mode makes the game even better. Last but not least, the item balance is the best. Why? Let's say you are second and you want to go first. In the old games you could hold two items. Now you take an item and it's a red shell. In the older versions of mario kart the first player could have for example triple bananas and a green shell, so it was unpossible to hit him. I mean it might be more difficult to go from 6th to 1st but still if you are first then you don't have to worry that much if you can hold a good defensive item and if you are second you have a higher chance of hitting the first racer.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

wariothelegend,27-07-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is easily the best game in the series to date. With it's vast amount of content and HD visuals, you're not going to regret buying this game. It's great for both beginners and experts. It even has a downloadable content!

Mario Kart 8's gimmick is the anti-gravity system, which allows you to race up walls or even the ceiling. Bumping into another racer gives you a satisfying spin-boost and which can be used as a strategy to what angle you bump a racer in so that only you will benefit. Mario Kart 8 also includes new items like the Boomerang Flower, Piranha Plant, Crazy 8 and finally an item that stops the invincible Blue Spiny Shell, the Super Horn.

Now with every game there's always a minor set back, and Mario Kart 8 is no different. It's character choices are very questionable, such as it's over load of baby counterpart, and Pink Gold Peach. But even that's not a major set back from this brilliant artwork. A family-fun party game that will truly amaze you!",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

If MKWii was still available to play online this would be okay, but due to Wi-Fi Connection being shut down, this is one sad disaster for me.

However, the tracks and the visuals are cool. DLC is among the best I've ever seen. That still won't fix the broken gameplay choices.

veedub,06-09-2016,"By far the best racing game I've ever played. The track designs are all great; there aren't any tracks that I genuinely dislike, and that's really saying something because I usually dislike at least one track. The addition of the glider, antigravity mode and submersible modes greatly adds to the gameplay that has been refined over the previous 7 titles. And the addition of 200cc mode brings back the ""HOLY CRAP THIS IS TOO FAST"" experience most of us enjoyed from the F-Zero series. (Not to mention in the DLCs having Mute City and Big Blue tracks).

Antigravity mode greatly expands the creativity of the track designs; the tracks can (and do!) fold over on themselves. One track is a giant Mobius strip; another track has a section that loops around on itself to become the outer wall of its own turn, then has a section where the track splits and you have opposing track sections upside-down from each other.

The game accommodates a full range of difficulty levels, from being easy enough that a 5 year old can win, to being difficult enough that even the most expert racer will have a hard time holding on to the top spots.

There was only one disappointment I had. Battle Mode sucks. As recently as Mariokart Wii (6th in the series) there was a robust battle mode with open course layout for battle. In Mariokart 8, those are gone, and have been replaced with simply battling on race tracks. (At least the tracks eligible for battle are designed so they can be traversed equally well both backward and forward). And it's particularly disappointing because the new antigrav, submarine and kite modes could have added so much depth to the battles.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Gregorylol,15-10-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is an inspiring and an amazing game. With smooth graphics and amazing gameplay, I don't get tired playing this game. The anti-gravity feature is a nice feature that adds a little touch to the Mario Kart series. The maps are arguably the best in the series. The things that disappoint in this game are the Battle Mode. Nintendo took out the battle only maps, and put them in the race maps. In online races, you're not allowed to pick from all of the maps, which sucks ass. However, all in all, this game is in the top 10 best Wii U games, and is definitely worth a try. I believe you should buy this game.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Coleybuddy,07-11-2016,"Mario Kart 8 is the best of all of the Mario Kart games I have played so far. Its main attraction is its graphics which look amazing when playing in full HD. I have decided to list the positives and negatives of this game.

Positives:

-The tracks are very creative and fun. This especially goes for the tracks taken from previous games since they are given an updated look and have the new features implemented into them, but are still kept as close to the original as possible.
-Online play is very fun with very little lag. I also like how you can have someone else play online mode on the same console.
-The DLC adds a huge amount of extra content with its three different packs. These packs add new karts, characters, and tracks to the already huge collection of content.
-The customization of karts returns from Mario Kart 7 and has even more variety.
-As I already said, the graphics are amazing. They are probably the best that I have seen on the WiiU so far.

Negatives:

-Most people will agree that the game's only noticeable flaw is the battle mode. I do agree that it was lazily made with there only being normal tracks available instead of the battle arenas that were present in the previous games.

Overall, this game is one of the most impressive games available on the WiiU and I would definitely recommend it.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ellocopepe96,27-11-2016,"primero que todo este juego es muy bueno y divertido como todos los mario karts los escenarios están muy bien hechos los graficos de puta madre , el juego va muy fluido , diversion asegurada.
Pero para mi no esta a la altura de los anteriores juegos de la saga , lo encuentro un poco vacio , el modo batalla no esta trabajado, no hay escenarios especificos para ese modo como en todos los otros mario karts , hay muchos personajes que no pintan ni con cola xd como los secuaces de bowser o toadette o peach de oro rosa que son mas bien de relleno , hubiesen metido a diddy kong o funky kong o bowsitos desde antes y no en un dlc o bowser jr etc . Algunas pistas son muy aburridas , la musica es normalita no me gusto que casi cada tema del juego tuviese trompetas todo el tiempo y muchas veces la musica pasa a segundo plano y no se escucha casi nada ya que ni siquiera te da la opcion de bajarle a los efectos de sonido del juego y dejar la música en un volumen mas alto. yo creo que eso es algo esencial hoy en dia ,que un juego te permita bajar o subir el volumen de cada sonido del juego .
y lo de los dlc es lo peor osea ¿que paso nintendo xD ? ya esta mal hacer dlc´s pero los dlcs que pusieron son de risa lo unico que vale la pena de los dlc son link ,bowsitos y algunas pistas nuevas, pero aun asi se nota que al juego le falto mas cariño.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

CH513,08-07-2017,"After the drop Mario Kart 7 was, the 8th game is a very decent improvement. The race tracks here are overall much better than those from MK7. The music is very memorable, the visuals are stunning for a Mario game, the redesigned tracks from previous games feel fresh and the online has a very good quality. But the 8/10 has its reasons: the character roster is by far the worst in the series, the difficulty is average, character voices are annoying, the new anti-gravity system is barely noticeable, the items are just too unbalanced for my liking and the game has the worst Battle mode in the series. Overall Mario Kart 8 will give you a lot of fun, but it will still leave much to be desired.

ProGamer88,11-10-2017,"Mario kart as a franchise, throughout its 25-year history, has become not only one of Nintendo's go-to-games but also a firm classic in many gamers opinions. The latest full game installment to this franchise, Mario kart 8 for the Wii U, brings about more of the same traditional Mario kart with a breath of fresh air to keep this classic relevant in the modern era of gaming.
The core of the single-player campaign gameplay remains almost the same as the previous game in the franchise. You choose from a selected roster of characters (most of which feature in previous Mario games) and race in grand prix consisting of 4 pre-determined races in order to unlock new characters, kart or bike choices or further grand prix.
Of course, if you're on your own you don't have to play the single-player campaign; you can also set up a casual race, play in the battle mode or if you have an internet connection you can take your game to the online multiplayer mode. The multiplayer mode is the best yet in the franchise with a suitable ranking system that has you racing against players with various skill levels in order to extend your own personal score. The downside to this being that you can sometimes get into games with a limited number of players; this can cause the race to lose its competitive edge.
In comparison to the previous games, Mario kart 8 looks stunning with a high definition glaze. As you glide around the colourful courses with your slick wheels twisting and turning you can't help but have fun.
Despite its many upsides, you can't help feeling that Nintendo has finally hit their last peak for the franchise.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
FS_Lover,11-04-2018,"I'm not very satisfied with this game, the only thing I appreciated was the graphics, which are very good, but there are many things that disappoint me... This isn't a pure Mario Kart, because there are characters from universes other than Mario's. Notice that I'm not saying that I'm disappointed that there are characters from other universes, but I am disappointed that Mario characters weren't given priority. There are many Mario characters they could have used, such as Birdo, like in Mario Kart Wii, or doctor Toadley, shroob, princess shroob, kamek, fawful, kylie koopa, cackletta, popple. There are so many Mario characters to choose from, there's no need to get characters from other series.
Another thing I dislike about MK8 are the physics. They're odd and you go faster if you hop.
The characters' voices are too quiet compared to the background music that you hear much more. On top of that, the characters don't have enough voice clips, unlike Mario Kart Wii.
I also dislike the rearranged tracks, particularly Wario Stadium. I think they could have done a better job with them.
t's a great thing that the retro tracks have been improved, however, they have been modified a bit , which is something they should have avoided. Again, Wario Stadium is a good example of this Another bad thing about this game is the way the objects work. For example, if you keep a banana peel behind you, it doesn't disappear from the object icon like it should.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

gamingstinky_,10-11-2019,"Mario Kart is one of the most popular video game franchises, and that is for a reason. From SNES to Switch, Mario kart never failed to innovate. Each game felt incredibly different than the others. The SNES version was the first, the classic. This game worked incredibly well for the hardware that it is running on. Mario kart 64 was the official switch to 3d, and it ran a lot more smoothly than the SNES version. After 64 came super circuit, which was just insane to me. It basically is the SNES version, it does not have a lot of differences, but it does look better than SNES, even though it runs on a Gameboy Advance, which is a really crappy system, from a visual, audio and hardware- perspective. It is just crazy to me how this Mario kart runs so well on such a **** platform. After that came double dash, with a completely different concept than the rest of the games, with two characters in one car. For many people, this is their favorite of the series. Mario Kart DS was also really good and was very impressive fort he system that it was one. It had a really fun singleplayer mode, which no Mario Kart ever really had, and it was the first handheld Mario Kart that didn’t feel watered down. Then in comes Mario Kart Wii, with a complete do-over on the controls, with some motion sickness included. A lot of people adore these controls, I despise them. I hate this game, the tracks are amazing, the soundtrack is amazing, the roster is amazing, but the gameplay got **** up because Nintendo didn’t give an option to race with the d-pad on the Wii mote. All of these games still are pretty amazing, but all of them lack extremely when you look at the newer games.

The reason Mario Kart 8 overshadows all the others, is because of the insane tracks, the upbeat songs, the amazing retro races and the Nintendo lasagne that is the Mario Kart 8 roster. Let’s start with the tracks.

The tracks in this game are absolutely mental from start to finish. Everything starts with Mario Kart Stadium, a track that is short, sweet, and gives a really good demonstration on the whole wall riding gimmick this game has adapted. It then continues with gems like Water Park, Sweet Sweet Canyons, Toad Harbor, Twisted Mansion and the best track of this game: Shy Guy Falls. These are only the two first cups, which there are 12 of. The tracks are insane, (Pokerap starts playing) Mount Wario, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodome, Bone Dry Dunes, Ice Ice Outpost, Circuit HYRULE?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The songs are also amazing, there is not one that sucks. Of course, there are absolute jams like Yoshis Valley, Shy Guy Falls, Ribbon Roads, Wario Stadium, Electro Dome, Music Park. These are certainly the best, but the others are amazing too. Oh yeah, I forgot the Animal Crossing one. WAIT, ANIMAL CROSSING?!?!?!?!?!?!?

The retro tracks have always sucked. They were never memorable and they were just exploiting nostalgia for money. I thought it was going to be like that for Mario Kart 8, too, but it was quite the contrary actually. It was like they were completely new tracks. Toads Turnpike now had a completely different route on the walls, You could drive underwater at Cheep Cheep Beach and Wario Stadium felt different with the Z- and water section. The retro tracks were refreshing and a total blast, they were nostalgic and original at the same time. It was amazing.

All of this makes for a great game, and the roster was pretty fine too. Although Pink Gold Peach really ground my gears. And the baby's are just a joke. Baby Rosalina? Really Nintendo? Nintendo? I think Reggie was too busy playing animal crossing new leaf on the new Nintendo 3ds during the development of this game because this is a joke. But these are just 5 characters, the rest are just classics. They even brought in the WAH himself.

But there is one reason, that I have been hinting at very generously, why this game, in particular, is so exciting. On a juicy day called 13 November 2014, an update dropped. Link, the hero himself, got added tot he roster. Everybody went crazy. There also was an F-Zero track in the DLC-pack. This meant a lot. Mario Kart wasn’t just Mario Kart anymore, and this DLC and DLC-pack 2 proved this. This is the reason this game is so amazing, it marks the beginning of a new era. Who knows who we’ll get next. Will a wild Pokémon appear in the next game? Will Olimar pick a fight wit hall the Mario man? Will Kirby return to racing, like in Kirby Airride? It is all very exciting, Mario Kart just turned into Smash Kart, and I love it.

Mario Kart 8 innovates, brings new ideas to the table and is extremely impressive with its audio and it is visually also very impressive. I give Mario Kart 8 a 9/10, because the online is still very limited.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

joel_tdl,21-12-2019,"La siguiente reseña fue publicada originalmente en 3djuegos:

De lo mejor en WiiU

JUGABILIDAD:
Jugabilidad clásica de los Kart con buen uso del Gamepad. Me ha gustado que las Copas se desbloqueen conforme a los resultados de las carreras. Hablando de ellas... pues son increíbles. Tanto las originales como los Remakes de las retro.
Poder jugarlo con botones, acelerómetro del Gamepad u otros periféricos es excelente.

GRÁFICOS:
Las pistas son preciosas, es indiscutible que se esforzaron por hacer notar un salto gráfico demostrando así el poder del WiiU que tanto fue cuestionado. El simple hecho de recorrerlas, hasta quitando de lado la competitividad, hace que el juego valga la pena.

SONIDO:
Las piezas son muy buenas, muy emocionantes y acertadas. Los efectos especiales pueden llegar a ser algo molestos al cabo de un rato, sobre todo si lo que se quiere es apreciar la música (como en mi caso), pero da una genial ambientación a cada carrera.

INNOVACIÓN:
Me ha agradado la customización, aunque no sea una innovación tal cual. Mario Kart 8 se queda con una jugabilidad clásica pero tan bien lograda que la carencia de originalidad pasa a segundo plano",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
CB186,05-01-2020,"This is my favourite game on the Nintendo Wii U. No Question.
All the new tracks are amazing with some of the best tracks in the whole series: Shy Guy Falls, Wild Woods, Super Bell Subway and Cloudtop Cruise. The retro tracks are completely different from the originals. DS Wario Stadium is barely recognisable from the original and its amazing what Nintendo have done here. This game is gorgeous.

The vehicle customisation is back from Mario Kart 7 and it hasn't changed. But, it never needed too. The new big feature is anti-gravity. This is fantastic on the highlight reel but aside from the speed boosts you can get from bumping into other racers, it doesn't really change the gameplay at all. This is one of the two flaws to this fantastic package.

The DLC is also sublime adding 16 new tracks, 6 new characters including Link and Villager and more vehicle customisation. However, Battle Mode is the worst it has ever been. There are 0 new battle tracks and race tracks are used to have battles on. Its a real shame as this loses this game a 10/10 for me.

However, this is a sublime game and one of the best Mario kart experiences I have ever had.

SirSoil,28-02-2020,"Mario Kart 8 is an excellent racing game with many unique tracks modes and features, however there is some issues here and there. First of all the character selection is weak yes you have your Mario bowser peach Luigi but there was a chance to bring obscure Mario characters but no you get 5 baby characters 2 metal versions of characters and a bunch of nobody’s from the new super Mario games. However the customization is great, sadly whatever you chose changes your states which is kinda of a bummer. However the tracks make up for it, all the tracks are amazing with their very own style and unique designs. The modes are appreciated, but sadly the maps I think are to big for the battle modes. Online for the most part is alright it works...sometimes. Mario Kart 8 isn’t the best racing game ever but it tries to and does it well in the tracks and modes, I just wish there was more variety in the characters and more options, like don’t make the customization change your states or make the battle maps smaller.

MadIsAdopted,20-11-2022,"I don't usually play any racing games, but damn, Mario Kart 8 is a true masterpiece.

Every track is literally a sandbox, which gives you multiple opportunities to choose a way to reach the finish line. Moreover, you can't fall off the track, which makes the game much less frustrating.

Graphics are top-notch. Everything is unbelievably smooth, colorful and eye-appealing. Framerate is very stable as well, so game runs perfectly.

Overall MK8's gameplay makes for a very fun gameplay. Rules are easy and the game itself is literally 'Easy to learn, hard to master'. Moreover, it contains the local- and net multiplayer, which gives you tens of hours of unstoppable pleasure.

I wish there was a better feeling of progression though. There're aren't actually any motivators for you to play so you have to find any goals yourself. At the end of the day, nothing but Silent Hill 2 is perfect, isn't it?",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
XabiXroSS,10-02-2022,"The game is beautiful and the tracks are very cool too. But the AI is really easy to beat and there's always a lot of distance between the top 3-4 and the rest AIs.

On the other hand, the online mode works really well but it could have more modes like on MK Wii.

But it's a fun game overall so it's worth and 8.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
nintendofan721,28-02-2022,"A great instalment of the Mario Kart franchise with a few problems. First off, the track selection is amazing and they all look graphically phenomenal. There are lots of unique tracks like Sunshine Airport, Cloudtop Cruise, Electrodrome, Mount Wario and more. This game also has the best retro track selection in the series so far, they’re all really fun to play and they have all been heavily updated with some tracks being barely recognizable like the GBA tracks and N64 Rainbow Road. The character selection is okay but not great. There are several important characters missing like Birdo, Dry Bones, Diddy Kong, Bowser Jr and King Boo, while it introduces a couple bad choices being Baby Rosalina and the worst Mario character ever, Pink Gold Peach! The music in this game is all live orchestrated which is a nice touch. This game’s main new mechanic is the anti gravity, which was an interesting idea and works very well. Online mode returns and it’s very solid. I do like the items they introduced in this game like the Piranha Plant and Super horn, but the item distribution is terrible. For example, you can get triple red shells in second or a coin in fifth. Speaking of which, the coin item is useless and comes up too often. The biggest problem about this game however is the battle mode, it stinks! There aren’t even actual stages, instead just modified versions of some of the tracks. But besides that, this game is awesome and I definitely enjoyed it on the Wii U.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

MentalVortex,25-01-2013,"This is definitely the pinnacle of the Mario Kart series and the best game for Wii, thanks to the highly satisfying online mode which CAN provide countless hours of replay value. HOWEVER, this enjoyment is hampered considerably due to the ever increasing amount of cheaters using hacked consoles to give themselves constant invincibility, infinite blue shells and other unfair advantages. For every 10 games played online, I would estimate you will encounter at LEAST 3 or 4 games with such cheaters. This was not a frequent occurrence when the game was initially released, but over time, and with Nintendo's proven unwillingness to address the issue, it has become a common annoyance which ruins the experience.

Aside from the online play, the addition of motorbikes is the most visible addition to the series, and have become quite popular since, more often than not, they are faster than the karts the game is named for. Regardless, the choice between the two vehicle types adds nice variety and good challenge for the underdogs using the classic go karts.

Lastly I should mention that while there are about 20 tracks, several of these are from previous games in the series making things seem not so original. A couple extra new courses would have gone a long way to keep things from getting stale over time.

Apart from these issues, the game offers an exciting racing experience which everyone can enjoy. The question however is ""for how long?""",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

cycodamo,03-08-2008,"Simply the best game I've played on the Wii so far. At first I thought it was a bit too easy and kind of a stripped down Mario Kart to appeal to a wider audience, but in fact it retains all of its challenge and unrelenting fun from previous iterations - finding the perfect line to powerslide around a corner before hitting a jump and executing a trick to try and catch up or leave the rest behind is terrific fun. Single player is a great challenge, and people who complain about being taken out by items obviously haven't been paying attention - that's what Mario Kart is all about! Besides, if you're good enough you can avoid them (ie don't stay in the middle of the road, you know that's where Bullet Bill travels). Online is where the game really shows off: it's completely lag free and there's nearly always a maximum 11 opponents to race against. You will quite easily race 50 times in a row without realising how much time you've spent online in this game - it's just so damn addicting and fun. Lastly, the wheel device is marvellously realised, very accurate and does increase your enjoyment of the game. Can't say enough good things about Mario Kart Wii, 10/10.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
LucoT,08-05-2008,"It feels like Mario kart:Collector's edition. 16 new tracks, 16 old ones, honestly I prefer racing on the new tracks. It's a good thing the racing is so fun, because they've really hashed the battle mode. This would have been an easy 10/10, but battle mode is integral to Mario Kart and it just don't feel right playing in teams all the time.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
TitaniumDragon,26-01-2009,"Mario Kart Wii is a good game, and is worth purchasing if you own a Wii. Its the latest iteration in the Mario Kart series, and it is a good game. But it isn't a great one, and its flaws rankle. First off, unlike its predecessors, you have to actually unlock the right to play every race. This sucks, because it is annoying not to be able to just jump in wherever. But the bigger issue here is that playing multiplayer -doesn't unlock the races-. So you get the game, plug it in to play with your friends (and you can now play with up to FOUR people vs the computers in the grand-prix type race) and... you can't play any but the first four cups without beating all the cups in single player. This is incredibly frustrating and there's absolutely no good reason for this. The races shouldn't be locked in the first place, and even if they had to be for some reason, there's absolutely no reason whatsoever multiplayer play shouldn't be able to unlock them. Battle Modes are, likewise, inferior; you can no longer do free-for-alls between four players, which were the most fun, and you can't do elimination battle matches anymore, which were also fun - why isn't this still an option, at least? There's no good reason for it. The computers also are very poor at battle mode. The items in this game also suffer from being too swingy. Blue shells are too difficult to avoid and Bullet Bills are just horribly overpowered and completely game-swinging, and frustrating when you're doing well and then suddenly a bullet bill comes up and beats you. Overall the game is a good game - its got good races (though I feel Mario Kart 64 had better courses on the whole) and it is a fun racing game, but there have been better racing games. If you play it alone, you'll probably like it quite a bit, but multiplayer just feels like second fiddle, and as I purchased it for the sole purpose of playing grand prix mode multiplayer, its quite annoying. That said, the time trials are quite cool in this game, as you race against ""ghosts"" which are previous racers. While this existed previously, you can now download and race against other players as well as the ""staff ghosts"", which makes it more enjoyable as you can sort of tell how well you're doing. Overall, thumbs up, but not the greatest game ever, let alone the greatest mario kart game ever. Incidentally, the Wii wheel is pretty awkward - you're better off using the controller.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Dare,05-01-2009,"Most of the time I hate reading user reviews. This game does not deserve a 10. It does not deserve a 0. Get real, folks. This game is really good, but a 10/10 means perfect, and this game isn't perfect.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
AdamB.,10-04-2009,"Compared to past Mario Kart games, Wii is nearly identical in terms of gameplay, with the exception of bikes, Miis, and online play. Mii support is great fun and makes online play much more diverse. The online play is nearly lag-free even with 12 players, and races and battles are always intense and fun, but there are a few serious downsides. There's no way to communicate with people online, or add them to your friends. So you're pretty much playing with random people all the time, and it feels like playing CPUs since you can't talk, wave, or perform any other basic type of human interaction. Nintendo constantly demonstrates its utter incompetence when it comes to online functionality. At first I was inclined to attribute the lack of features to the family-friendly nature of the Wii, until I encountered players named ""Turdnugget"" or who used Hitler and penis-faced Miis in online games. The removal of dual-player karts is also a step down from Double Dash, but the inclusion of tracks from SNES, GBA, N64, and GameCube are a welcome addition. Getting a 3-star overall rating is essentially impossible, so it's honestly baffling why they included it. Even two stars on 150cc tracks requires constantly restarting the 4-race circuit, and a constant stream of blue shells along with the unforgiving and cheap AI will result in controllers broken in frustration. Players going for high scores needn't bother using the overly sensitive and fairly useless motion control feature. Despite the numerous downsides, Nintendo managed to put in a fairly respectable effort that's a lot of fun (in short bursts at least) for gamers of all ages.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JG,24-11-2008,"Graphics: 10 star variaty: 8 unlockables: 4 single player: 10 multiplaer: 4 I have played Double dash for a long time and liked it a lot. I just got the wii and got Mario Kart Wii. The graphics are awsome as for most wii games. Great variety after unlocking 32 tracks, 8 cirsuints, 90 bikes, 90 karts, and 30 charictars. The The unlockable list is confusing which is why I rated that at 4. Single player is insainley good (better than expected)!

The online is great, all of the bikes and karts are fun to use, and this game is really fun to play with friends and family. Many people complain about the computer cheating on the game, and it does to a certain extent. However, isn't that like almost every other racing game?

RamKikura,29-02-2012,"This is a weird game.
Very good in some respects, and very bad in others.
The good points:
-The time trial mode is AWESOME. Every aspect of this mode is near perfect. This is by far one of the best features of the game.
-On VS mode in two player, when you turn off the items and the AI players, it is a very enjoyable racing game.
-On VS mode in two player, with balanced items and no AI, it is very like the N64 version for game play, which is great.
-The characters are awesome, and the addition of the bikes takes it a step forward. (Although after playing for a while you start to realize that it should be called Mario Bike, because there isn't much point to using the karts after realizing how much better the bikes are.)
-Some of the new levels are really fun to play.

Now for the negatives
-Grand Prix is a huge let down. After realizing that the wheel contoller syley is a hinderance instead of a help, and switching to the controller/numchuck configuration, 50cc is way too easy. The rubber band AI in 150cc is so over the top that it's not really worth playing 150cc cups unless you want to unlock characters/carts/bikes/mirror mode. 100cc came close to being fun, but didn't quite balance out right.
-The reliance of over-powered items (espically in 150cc) rather than making the AI better racers.
-The wheel controller style is very inaccurate and annoying to use.
-Battle mode isn't worth playing
-No 2 player Grand Prix
-This is way too much of a luck game. I could understand having multiplayer purely casual (or as I would like to have seen, a way to change the setting between casual and hardcore style gaming) but making the solo player grand prix mode the way it is makes no sense to me. The overpowered items, the terrible rubber band AI, the addition of 4 more racers to throw things at you, the fact that 9 times out of 10 all 12 racers finish the race within 3-5 seconds of each other so when you get hit with 3 red shells, 2 blue shells, and a pow block right at the end, you go from 1st to 11th, and just the simple fact that you can't go a tenth of a lap without getting hit with something make it very unenjoyable to play.
-Overall the game felt lazy too me. It seems as though they relied on the gimick of the wheel controller and the new items to sell the game, and in the process got very sloppy with the actual gameplay.

So overall, I feel that this game had tons of potential, but unfortunatly a lot of it was wasted. While there were definatly some very strong points (mainly the time trial mode as I mentioned) overall it was a very underwhelming game given what we have come to expect in the Mario Kart franchise.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Also, anyone who complains about how unresponsive the Wii's motion controls are needs to play this game.

DukeJon,29-01-2012,"The wii wheel and the strong multiplayer presence make this game a good purchase. There's lots to unlock and many courses (although many are quite basic looking). The mario kart channel is also very good.

However the reason I gave this game a low-ish score is because racing games should reward you for being a good racer. The problem with Mario Kart is that there are far too many random events that can determine the outcome of a race. Items are very unbalanced - the rocket can put you from last place to first place in half a lap and of course there's the dreaded ""blue shell"". In so many races I can built up a strong lead only to be hit by a blue shell, followed by a ""pow"", that both end up knocking me off the course. The recovery times are also very long as well. It's rather frustrating to lose a race for no other reason that you were unlucky. There should be a mode where you can disable items entirely or reduce the recovery time. Then the best racer would win, rather than the luckiest.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

cbeers2513,28-12-2013,"Those blue shells...
Mario Kart Wii is a fun game that uses the Wii's motion control well to a certain extent. The race tracks are varied and colorful and offer plenty of death-defying jumps and game-changing turns. But, beneath the vibrant environments that Mario Kart has to offer, the experience as a whole is both short and shallow. Each track loses its spark after a race or two and there is just no reason to keep playing the campaign unless you are a completionist who needs to have every trophy in his possession. There is no clear advantage or disadvantage to any one racer, feeling like a wasted opportunity. In addition, no customization or skill points for one's Miis is a considerable letdown. But Mario Kart's worst offense is its perpetual frustration in regards to enemy AI. This game is one of those few titles that a player can deem ""cruelly unfair."" Once you go deeper into the game, the competitions no longer depend on skill or driving ability but how lucky you are in regards to the number of blue shells blowing up in your face. The last race I played before discarding Mario Kart for a long time had me in first place mere feet from the finish line. A string of three shells fired at me in rapid succession dropped me from a first place victory to a 10th place embarrassment, and serves as a lasting reminder of my experience with the game. Mario Kart Wii is hit or miss, but is guaranteed to frustrate even the most skilled of drivers. There are genuinely enjoyable co-op moments and a few incredible tracks, but the difficulty spike is just too infuriating to overcome.

GamerOfGames,05-07-2011,"Mario Kart Wii is one of the best racing games around. That said, I feel it is overrated. It's awesome, but Mario Kart Wii just relies too much on pure LUCK. The items are pure luck, and are not even balanced. A person in last place could go straight up into the Top 3 with a Bullet Bill. And don't even get me started on that SPINY SHELL! My sister plays this game a lot, and, more than once, she was hit by 5+ items in a row just as she was about to win. Once, she was hit by a Spiny Shell, then a Red Shell, then another Spiny, then another Red Shell, then a Green Shell. So ridiculously ANNOYING! Luckily, Time Trials exist. In this mode, you can play on your own with no opponents, no item boxes, and 3 Mushrooms at the start. Multiplayer mode was nice, but it needed far more modes. Wi-Fi, too. The only thing that I still play Mario Kart Wii to do is race Time Trial ghosts. That was fun. So, in conclusion, this is a great game to get if you have friends who would be willing to play with you, because multiplayer is the reason to buy this game, and Time Trials is also great, but don't expect much more than that other than loads of frustration.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

It only works sometimes and can be fun but framerate suffers often.The feeling of speed is nowhere near Double Dash and the game overall feels like it was made to cater to new players, which is fine, but it won't be impressing any Mario Kart veterans.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GamecubeLover,01-08-2016,"Wow this game is great but the game is flawed. The problems are the motion controls, most of the tracks are generic, not memorable, and not addicting enough as other Mario Kart games.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Mauriced.,05-05-2008,"If you're looking for a comment that is without unfair bias and unnecessary hatred toward the game for no reason, look no further. First of all, let me say I've been playing Mario Kart since it came out for SNES, although I admit the only other one I played was Mario Kart 64 (which to me, remains the best). The most annoying thing about Mario Kart Wii, by far, are the babyish/childish voices. Good lord, they are annoying. Not only are they excessive, high-pitched, and embarrassing, they are not natural in the least bit. Just about the only characters who have remained true to what they're supposed to sound like are Mario, Luigi, and Koopa Troopa, with Peach and Bowser being ""acceptable"". All the other characters, including Yoshi, Donkey Kong, Diddy Kong, Toad, etc sound odd and very childish. Why couldn't Nintendo included an option to turn off voice SFX and/or music like the previous Mario Karts? As for control, it can be somewhat difficult at times, as others have stated, but I believe with enough time spent in front of the TV, you'll eventually figure it out. The graphics are not as bad as many make it out to be - this is, after all, Nintendo. The items are fairly fun to use but can become very excessive - which leads me to my next point... The A.I., as others have stated before me, can be very unfair in the sense that you will be punished whether you are winning or not. This can happen via a blue shell as you're approaching the finish line in lap 3, or the fact that if ou lag behind far enough, pretty much no power-up (or series of power-ups) will save you. Couple this, with the fact that you can no longer ""retry"" races, and you've got yourself a hell of a hard time in getting gold cups in 100 and 150cc. Overall, a fun game, crippled with many, in my opinion, stupid oversights by Nintendo's part, with overzealousness in areas that should have stayed timid.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JacobR,30-11-2009,Easily one of the most overrated games in recent memory- and I'm not a fanboy. I loved pretty much every first party title on the wii except for this. I guess I was spoiled by the amazing Mario Kart DS.,6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
WiiRulez,19-12-2010,"Probably the best racing games of all time! It's fun, it's fast and it's for the Wii! It puts games like need for speed to shame. Why is that you may ask? Because Mario Kart Wii has something other games wish they had! Skill! That's right, this game actually requires skill to play. Unlike those other crappy racing games that you'll see 40 year olds playing in their mother's basements. This game is for all ages and is exciting to play! not to mention how great the graphics are!

ChaseD.,05-05-2008,"A horrible entry into the series, it seems to be nintendo's trend of late in order to go along with their system being marketed to new markets (toddlers and the old and decrepit) to sacrifice their fanbase and the depth of gameplay of their games in favor of easily accessible 20 min of fun followed by a lifetime of byers remorse.

CulleyS,12-05-2008,"I agree with the Game Chronicles review of this game completely. There are too many random events, likely conceived as challenges to make the game more entertaining, which too often serve to detract from the game. For instance, blue flying shells can knock a player out of first place, or any player near the racer in first place. Bullet Bills can bring a player in last place (or close to last) flying through the field all the way up to first place. I simply cannot recommend this game. It could have been really fun, but the lack of skill involved (or, more accurately, the lack of being rewarded for skill or penalized for making poor choices) damages the game. Furthermore, I bought this game to play in multi-player mode. The lack of features for 2 or more players is the main reason I've scored Mario Kart Wii so low. No features can be unlocked, no trophies for your license, and really only three types of races can be run in multi-player mode.",4,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
pikodon,03-04-2014,"12 players in a race is crazy, especially in 1P mode, considering the lowest placed placed characters get more aggressive items like thunder and blue shells, sometimes the crazy goes race since they didn't fine tune this feature here, many times you'll find yourself about to cross the finish line and someone uses a thunder, you get 2 blue shells, and someone else uses a thunder.
it just doesn't work, at least not without some much needed adjusting, because it still follows the numbering from previous games ( places 5 and under get stars, blue shells, bullet bill, thunder, etc ) so there's at least 6 people under 5th place and it becomes really unfair really fast.
I'd love to give this a higher grade especially considering how it improved from double dash, but this really keeps me from it, because it makes the game way too frustrating",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Zoidberg,28-03-2011,"I was, and still am, a big fan of ""Mario Kart : Double Dash"" on the Gamecube and ""Mario Kart Wii"" was the biggest dissapointment I've had in a long time. Proof being that I sold it (which I rarely do with my games).

The Wii Wheel and bikes are gimmicky features, technically it is not extraordinary. We also lose the highly interesting and tactical ""two characters thus two active objects at the same time"", and we also lose the character-specific objects.

The worst part being the anorectic multiplayer. My MK pal and I would just have loved the MK:DD multiplayer with just online play added. They could also have added more arenas, differently sized arena, possibility to tweak the object distribution chance, etc...

They did... nothing... Except removing ""friendly fire"" (an opponent taking his own shell is the most hilarious thing that can happen in MK:DD) and forcing a time limit. NOTHING is tweakable.

The only positive thing about ""Mario Kart Wii"" is online play: simple, effective.

Too bad the game itself is so low quality gameplay-wise. Being 12 in a race and with the highly overpowered items, races are even more random than previously.

Even in single/multiplayer race mode, I still prefer MK:DD hands down.

As a regular multiplayer cart racing game, it could get a 5 or 6.

Down in the bin for me.",3,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
RicB.,18-04-2008,"Someone must explain me one thing: How could they fucking think that having grand prix mode taked out of multiplayer wouldn't hurt the game?

Than again even this people who use to like this game that much anger about bad balance, items and luck usage. For me who prefers offline gameing with friends and coop single player like in Double Dash, MK: Wii is a bit of a disappointment. Major features, items and options that just had to be ported from previous Mario Karts are totally missing. Where are the old items? Why are fun maps like Babypark missing? Why only one driver per car/bike and not haveing an option to allow 2 at least for offline gameing? Why is there no coop mode for singleplayer?

Wheel control is iffy to nigh on impossible depending on your character, but its even worse when it is forced onto you when playing single player, and forced on someone in multiplayer. Compared to double dash (my favorite) the new levels are fairly dull, without standout moments (you get fired from a connon in about 5 tracks...sigh) whilst others being eerily similar to previous tracks, characters have lost their unique weapons, the whole game feels slower and the chance of being robbed of a win at the finish line by a blue shell/bullet bill/lightening occurs constantly. Worst of all they've messed around with the character voices with DK being particullarly strange and the music sounds tinny... best avoid this one.",2,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

JohnC,16-10-2008,"At first this might seem like Nintendo's best game to date, but further play proves it is actually their worst. When did good programming go out of style? While single player mode is tolerable, if fun even, the multiplayer is maddening. Rolling a pair of dice takes about as much skill. And that's if you aren't continually disconnected, which usually results in a 300 point loss (when you have a high score around 8500-9000) and it can take a lot of games to recover that at a 50 point avg win per game, especially when this happens nearly every day and sometimes more. If you are lucky enough to remain connected, you will be treated to a giant helping of cheapness. Being in first for three laps means nothing when three blue shells in a row land and send you back to last place. The types of weapons mean for the most part, whoever gets the best weapon last wins. Roll the dice. And lets not forget that useless wii wheel. Tendinitis anyone? It would be so easy to fix this game (no dropped points on SERVER disconnections which have nothing to do with client connection, options for turning off super weapons or at least having them disabled in lap 3), but Nintendo is satisfied taking our money and giving us a sub-par product that doesn't get updated or fixed. Thanks Nintendo.

They dumbed it down to a level where a hardcore pro gamer could easily be beat by a 3 year old with no skill. It really has just become a game of pure luck based on what item you get. My biggest fuss with this game though, is the audio. It has devolved from having a quality soundtrack in the older versions, to a CONSTANT stream of ""woohoo!, yeah! wahahah!"" that can not be turned down. Thats right, there are no audio options that let you turn down the SFX, Music, or Voice volumes. Playing this game for more than an hour will make you want to just mute the TV because of the constant stream of the ""woohoo!""s and ""yaaha!""s.

This game comes with a wheel that you put your wii controler in and you use it to steer! I still much rather prefer the game cube controlers but thats just me. Online multiplayer is a great add on to the mario kart series where it tells you where your oponents are from then you vote for a track. There are some down sides to this game though too. Like the graphics, now mario kart has never really had great graphic but after how ever many games you would expect them to get some better graphics. Now don't get me wrong the graphics are good it's just i would like to see graphics that look like mario galaxy. and when finding a game online sometimes it can take more then 10 minutes!

And my expectations for this game were low, including the online multiplayer. First up, the single player mode is same old same old. But to compound that problem the cups feature the same tracks, making it three times as dull to complete. The addition of bikes is stupid and the 100cc bikes seem slower than their 50cc kart counterparts. After completing the 50cc cups you get a lengthy and unskippable credits sequence which seems odd when you're only one third the way through. As for multiplayer, in battle mode it's two teams of up to 6 versus each other in balloon mode or coin collecting. It's fun for the most part, but would be SO much better if it were free for all or four teams of three. Also, the lack of an ability to communicate properly with the people you are playing against means there is really little point to it all. The fun of mariokart was always about having a laugh with those you play with. Not being able to chat with your team mates means it's a very lonely existence still. Then there is the Wii wheel. It takes only one word to sum this up. GARBAGE. Okay, some might like it, but it's largely pointless. It over complicates the controls and can be flaky to use. When on a bike it also is unnatural. Stick to the nunchuk and wii-mote. Ultimately, it's an okay game that is nowhere near worth the money some have paid for it. I'm glad mine was only £20 on pre-order.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
ChrisB.,28-04-2008,"Using the racing wheel is much more fun than I imagined it would be. There is a strong feeling of actually being behind the wheel that I didn't expect. Playing with two or more people is a bit difficult because sometimes you can't see much above/below you and therefore don't know what to do. For example the Rainbow Road track is very difficult with a split screen because when going up and down all the ""rainbow"" hills you can't see what's ahead of you.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

KateT,11-05-2008,"Being a huge fan of the Mario Kart series, I was definitely excited when I first bought this game. However, after playing it for awhile now, I realize that this game is definitely the weakest in the series. I had quite a few problems with the game, some of them being: -The items: It seems this time around, the items are used all too frequently, and it's very annoying when you're playing. For instance, getting hit by red shells non-stop, and those damn flying shells that hit you when you're in first place. Also, the favouritsm with the items is appaulling, if you're doing well (ie. the top three..) then you get horrible items like bananas and green shells. When you're in last, you get awesome items. It just isn't fair. -The Music: I remember when each Mario Kart level used to have distinct music that I would love to hear when I was playing the game. (Rainbow Road, anyone?) But it all seems a bit lost in translation here. Instead, we get o hear characters make annoying noises, such as ""WHOO HOO!"" and ""Yeahhhhhh!"" It's just plain irritating, and makes gameplay all the more difficult. And last, but not least, my last complaint is that the game seems to rely too much on a gimmick (the steering with the Wiimote) and, in turn the levels are just not that fun. Some levels are loaded with things that can hit you, you can fall off of, while others are just so boring you'll want to fall asleep while playing them. I also wanted to enjoy the Retro levels, but it seems like they just haaaaaad to update those too. Overall, I find myself not really wanting to go back and play this game, but rather whip out my Gamecube or Nintendo 64 to play some real Mario Kart. So, if you're a fan of the series check this game out, if not, just don't bother with it.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Brandon,01-05-2008,"As with any Nintendo game, fun is the name of the game. I've had a ton of fun playing this game thus far. The most brilliant part of this game is the online play option.

LondonCalling,03-05-2008,Never played MK on any platform before and was really impressed. The wheel is harder to use than nunchuk + wiimote but twice as much fun.

LS.,05-05-2008,"I love all the people talking about how some of the levels don't seem very new. That's because they are retro levels you dumb twits. I for one love the retro levels. As does my brother, fiancee, and about everyone else I've had come over to my house to play Mario Kart since we bought it last Tuesday. I've played every single Mario Kart since the SNES and have had a ton of fun with this one. As far as the online MP goes; it's not surprising that Nintendo stayed away from online voices since the era of XBL idiots spewing racial slurs, profanity, and 'your mom' jokes. I can't help but laugh at all the people talking about 'skill' in a Mario Kart game. Do the rest of us a favor and get over yourselves. Mario Kart as a series runs on the fact that the game is random and whimsical. If you wanted annoying realistic BS crap...play Gran Tourismo. That game is sooo terribly bad that the people who have no sense of fun like the complainers here must love it. The last part. Why are you complaining about the Wii Wheel? Is it the only way to play the game? Um, no. You can still play with the Wii-mote and Nunchuck. Honestly, I like using the wheel because it makes the game harder for me when I'm playing against people that haven't played before. If I were to use the Wii-mote and Nunchuck I'd be pulling off power-slides and mini turbos the entire race. The way I see it the Wii-wheel offers another way to play, and a slight handicap for the veteran gamers to overcome. I bought GTA4 on the same day as Mario Kart Wii and haven't even opened GTA4 yet.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
UweP.l,05-05-2008,"This Mario Kart has the best racing mechanics in the series yet, and the online mode is just superb, bar the lack of customization that is available in offline multiplayer, such as the option to select how big a part the items will play. It would've been sweet to be able to get rid of that blue shell online.

RoaldM,09-05-2008,"It's a very good and addicting game, and the new online mode makes is even more awesome!

Also, the trick system is also a good improvement to the formula. But, what also kinda, not that much, dissaponited me was that not all the tracks were new.

KeithP,10-04-2009,Mario Kart Wii is a really great game. It's really fun to play. I can see why the game got a lot of good reviews and why it sold a lot of copies. I give Mario Kart Wii a 10 out of 10.,10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Tuah,14-10-2008,"The Mario Kart series is always amazingly fun to play, and Mario Kart Wii is no different. All the new characters are fun to have, and 12-contestant races are a lot more exciting than the 8-player ones have been. The Wiimote/Wheel controls are something I greatly enjoy, and I probably won't play with classic or Gamecube controllers often. The fact that there's an option makes this a much more fun game for all. I actually enjoy the fact that snaking has been taken out. While experienced gamers should obviously be better than newbies, snaking turned a gap into a canyon. The biggest problem this game suffers from is all the items. No matter whether I'm in 1st, 2nd, 6th or 11th, I still get pelted with all sorts of items. The POW block is completely overpowered, and red and blue shells are simply far too common. When paired with the poor catch-up AI, it's a setup for player failure, regardless of skill. Why can't I auto-catch-up? With items or poor AI, there will at least be a little balance. With both, the scales are tipped far to the computer. Online play is simply amazing. Lastly, to Wayne G, who gave the game a 2: The graphics are almost exactly the same as Double Dash. Most of the models have been reused. You know those characters from Super Mario 64 DS? They're exactly the same as in Double Dash and Kart Wii. Looking at Double Dash's lighting and shading techniques, I still notice a lot of the polygon edges, which are very well hidden in Wii.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
JC,22-10-2008,"I would have to say that anyone expecting ""good"" graphics in a game should not be judging anything with the word Mario in it. Nintendo puts less emphasis on Graphics and more emphasis on gameplay. Therefore I dont judge nintendo games on graphics. Pros - Unlike other posts, in my belief the items carry substantial pickup, from the Black rocket and the Pow to Star Power and the Red Shell. This alows players, usually punished by top speed to still compete with faster players. COns - However, it seems that if you keep first place for long enoh, the computer will totally wreck you. I have had many a time being within a few carts of the finish line and being overthrown with spied shells, pows and red shells and get put back to 4 to possibly even 9th on one level. However, my 4th place Spike shell gain was rather interesting. Level designs are quite distinct, as there are 16 new levels as well as 16 levels from the old games, including a few from the SNES, which brings back memories. The online function is great, but isnt fair for players who dont play the single player game simply because they have neither the carts or bikes/characters to compete with die hard fans. This puts some players at a full disadvantage. I have to admitthat some of the souds/voices of characters have become childish, but what would be expected from companies that normally be designed for a younger age. I think it is not reasonable to realise that this game was not designed primarily for adults. However, i dont find the single player 150cc as challenging as others have, being as how 6/8 cups resulted in golds on attempt 1 which was rather a dissapointment for me.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The online is great fun and probably the best we'll be able to get out of nintendo this generation. Connecting to a game takes a little while but once your in one load times are fairly short. The only problem with this, and it's one thats occurred in all mario karts, is the lack of new levels; 16 tracks is just not enough to be honest, and packing in another 16 old ones doesn't do enough to mix it up.

The whole series is excellent and this is the best of the lot. 32 tracks, 16 brand new, more characters, more battles, better time trial options with expert times to beat and best of all, an online mode with a rating system which tracks your progress. Small criticisms however are they you get the feeling there could be maybe 24 new tracks and 8 ""retro"" courses, it seems like just adding some courses from the SNES and Gameboy was unnecessary and a time saving exercise. Occasionally things get a bit clumsy online too with other players disappearing and reappearing randomly, although I suspect that this isn't entirely the games fault.

Some people may say that the game has just come down to luck, but I beg to differ. Many times over, I have beaten the CPUs when getting hit by the blue shell multiple times! However, I suppose the items from the CPUs might still be a problem. I think the CPUs should win with skill, not just items. Believe me when I say that I've been in countless races with other people, involving mostly skill. I do agree that there are a few MINOR problems: 1) No free-for-all battle mode, only teams 2) Manual-drift bikes have an unfair advantage over karts. 3) Terrible Mii voices Otherwise, this is possibly the most fun game I've ever played.

The only short coming of this game is that regardless of how skilled you may be, victory is often dominated by luck, due to an excessive amount of unstoppable weapons that tend to annihilate whoever is in first place, and all too often, the game has a nasty habit of bringing it all down on you at once right before the end of a race, however, in the online gaming world, this gives less skilled players a bit more of an advantage, making it more difficult for someone to endlessly dominate and dishearten new players.

As for the games ""flaws"", I never cared much for battle mode, and having victory snatched from your hands at the last minute, seemingly ""unfairly"", has always been the nature of Mario Kart.

There are a few odd decisions for the new game, like how battling on teams is the only option. The game is getting a little to hectic and random, with the old items as well as Pow Block, Blooper, Lightning Cloud, Bullet Bill, and Mega Mushroom. The Wii controls work great but Nintendo switched the drifting system to make it a little too easy. Mario Kart Wii is a great game, especially online, and will keep you coming back again and again if the series is getting a little too easy.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Fredrick2003,13-08-2011,"One of the best reasons to hang on to your Wii that may or may not be getting much use currently. Following the tradition of the Mario Kart series from its humble beginnings on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Nintendo delivers another stellar entry. If you've ever played Mario Kart before you will be right at home, and if you haven't, this is the perfect place to start, and a lot more forgiving than the portable games â",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Bathmat,08-01-2011,"Mario Kart is the best Mario spin-off there is. When I played this game, I just enjoyed it, from start to finish. Sure, there's a bit of luck involved, there's nothing like knocking off someone's top position at the last minute. Nothing like it. The gameplay is just really fun. Need I say more? Half of the game's tracks are new, but the other half are old tracks. Some might consider it a weakness. However, this is just what I wanted them to do. The old SNES and N64 tracks in modern graphics = awesome sauce. The game offers you multiple ways to play it and Nintendo have done the right thing. You can use the Wii Remote, equip it with a Wii Wheel, use the nuchuck, play with the classic controller or the best one: the Gamecube controller. The best part yet it the multiplayer. Watching you pwn your mates, there's nothing quite like it. The Mario Kart seriesis everything games should be: Fun, addictive, surprising, great fun in single and multiplayer mode. Just a shame Nintendo didn't push the series further.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

anonreview,14-03-2011,"My expectations of this game were high for two reasons- the impeccable standard of previous Mario games, and the Nintendo DS version of this game. This game, unfortunately, did not live up to these expectations. Without a doubt, this game was entertaining and enjoyable, but it was not as epic or classic as the DS version, and fails to raise is to games such as Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros Brawl. The graphics and animation were a major let-down, the visuals were not as neat, yet intricate, as the DS version.

However, perhaps one should not compare this game to the DS version. They are different games, after all. This game was pleasing. Worth the money? Possibly.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Set with nice content to keep you busy , responsive gameplay , and colorful graphics gives life to the known Mario icon. The bundle that includes a steering wheel adds diversity, the steering wheels doesn't change nothing to the experience, because it;s just a piece of plastic that it;;s empty , you just put the Wii remote to it, and Voila!!! there you have a ""real"" experience of how to drive in the future. In case of the online , it plays decently fine not a big thing or video games transformer.

The online play is very fun, and shows everyone what the Wii is capable of. But somethings can get a bit on your nerves. Like the fact that Blue Shells can ruin your chances of doing half decent or how a non-skilled player with a Bullet Bill can skip right to the front. And the line-up could have received a bigger variety of characters, maybe from other first party games, instead of Baby Mario and Baby Luigi, etc. Still, it's a very good game and I think it deserves a score of 8 out of 10.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

RJV,25-09-2011,"Mario Kart Wii is very well made. The Wii's motion control is, in a rare case, used to perfection. The handling is great, the buttons feel natural, and with a Wii Wheel it feels right. Also, if you have played, the DS version for example, you notice that the old style of staying in a straight line for as long as possible for maximum efficiency has been scrapped, and now is more about not hitting the more numerous obstacles. you have ever in the slightest liked another Mario Kart game, then this is better. This being the sixth in the series, it is obvious that Nintendo has definitely got it right this time, with new moves, such as shaking the Wii Wheel while doing a jump to get a boost when you land, and a new power-up or two, it won't make you say ""same old game"". The new courses are great, and the retro ones are also great choices. When you first start playing the 50cc Grand Prix, even as a rookie, if this is your first time for Mario Kart, it is really easy, and trains you well. The easiness quickly vanishes as you get to 150cc though. Incredibly hard, Incredibly frustrating, yet still incredibly rewarding once completed. Online multiplayer is great, and with more characters and karts than ever, if you have a Wii, get the game. If you don't have a Wii, consider getting one for this game alone.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The game is also very ugly when you play it in split-screen (each mini-screen is really low-res), and below average for singleplayer. There isn't much emphasize on actual driving, and the last player always gets the best items, meaning that if you lead the race for the first lap you'll eventually be hit by an automatic homing-shell and the rest will catch up.

cbrandhagen,31-01-2012,"I have played every Mario Kart Nintendo has come up with so far. Each time Nintendo makes some improvements and some things are made worse. In comparison to the GameCube version, this one improved by allowing game play to be done over the internet. It is fun and interesting to be able to play against other players around the world rather than playing alone. This type of play doesn't come without problems, however. Some of the players on the Wi-Fi have found ways of cheating. Nintendo does try to stop this, but it hasn't been able to. Another problem is that some of the players must not have jobs or school because they have become so good at the game that it seems they devote their entire lives to playing and improving. Maybe there should be some sort of system so that a person can play against others around their own skill level. There may be a way of doing this which I haven't had time to explore.

One of the things that was changed from the GameCube version is the weapons. In the GameCube version a player could hold two weapons at a time by running over a double box. In this version there are only single boxes. This may be to some players' liking, but not mine. Nintendo has made the Wii remote work really well with this game. Instead of the standard controller being used for play, the person can use a wheel that they hold in the air. This has made the game easier and more realistic. It seems strange to hold a wheel in the air, but over time a player can get used to this concept.

Overall, I would say this game is fun. The object is to race karts with computer players, internet players, or people in the room. Weapons are fun and interesting ways to try and slow down opponents. Strategic use of the weapons is essential to winning the game. It would be neat to be able to play all tracks from previous games though. There are some that I really enjoy from previous versions, but were not included in the game. Nintendo did include some favorite tracks (favorites of who is not something I am aware of) from earlier versions, but not many of my favorites made the cut. One thing I can't understand is why Nintendo only makes about one Mario Kart version per system I enjoy the game a lot, but tend to get bored after awhile and desire a newer version.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

What's great: The ability to race a friend through your friend roster, addition of bikes and allowing them to wheelie, bringing back the classic retro courses, of course!

What's not so great: The game offers an unbalanced selection of characters and vehicles. Also, when you complete and unlock everything offline, what is left to do for those who cannot play online? Would I recommend this game to a friend?

FaloRoy,17-12-2012,"Honestly, this game is pretty good, but not amazing. The bikes are definitely neat (anyone who says they're a gimmick is being a purist who is scared of change), the graphics are beautiful for the Wii, and the sound as a whole is very pleasing. I also think the character list is the best in the series so far with its sheer size and variety. Single player is almost as deep as the DS version; the only little problem I saw was that I had to go online to access the challenges instead of them being there at the start of the game, like the missions in DS. Multiplayer is very fun locally, with a nice amount of customization for your own way to play. Online is a definite improvement with the only drawback being the hackers and the way VR was calculated, otherwise it is very good. Battle mode is okay with 10 tracks, but the forced team battle was head-scratching, along with the Blue Shell making an appearance (that's not necessary). The tracks are pretty cool and creative with some interesting obstacles, I just felt some tracks were a bit over-laden with hazards (like Bowser's Castle), but were mostly full of nice design. The Wii wheel is not a gimmick either, but it does have a learning curve in which you need to hold it right for it to work. And the controls, as a whole, are responsive and fluid with no big sign of unplayability. The huge annoyance that everyone says about this game is, of course, the rubber-banding races as a result of the crazy items. The new items do sound cool, but that coupled with 12 racers on the track make the game way too reliant on items and luck, and little is based on skill. In single player racing this isn't so bad because at least the AI is not very good at driving (believe me, it is very easy), but in multiplayer this can be very frustrating for those that really want to win. If you can fight through this, it really isn't a deal-breaker that kills the experience, but it can be a real screw-over in some instances. In my opinion, it's too flawed to be considered the best Mario kart game, but it's not awful enough that it's the worst/least good version either. An 8.4/10 from me, and I do feel that only a die-hard would give this game anything higher than a 9, and only someone who focuses mostly on the negatives would ever score this lower than a 6. In the end, a solid game.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Some people may argue that ""there's too little skill involved"", but after all, that's not what the game is about, it's about trolling your friends, and if you take everything seriously, why do you own a wii to begin with? For me the game doesn't get a perfect score because of minor control issues, and the blue shells, which do not benefit the user in any way, and therefore, are just annoying.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Shomanjo,19-01-2013,"Mario Kart Wii is a game that gets a lot of flack for its Tough as Nails AI rubberbanding. But this in no way breaks the game. Since the SNES edition, Super Mario Kart, there has always been a brutal Comeback run by the Game's AI that makes finishing a 150cc Race a great challenge. But if you can look past this, you'll find a solid Racing game. Right off the bat, Nintendo had added a Steering wheel peripheral, that, while unneccessary, can help to simulate a real steering wheel with almost precise 1:1 steering motion. It controls very well, and after getting the hang of it, can help you race with friends,AI, or people online almost as if you were using a regular button controller. Along with this, Mario Kart Wii has some of the best controls so far in the Franchise, as Drifting, Item usage, and steering all work like a Dream. With the addition of Motorcycles, Nintendo adds a new layer of strategy to the game, causing the player to decide between the Wheelie boosts a Bike can use, or the powerful Double Boosts a regular Kart can use. The game also uses ""Tricks"", where pushing anywhere on the D-Pad on a regular GC or Classic controller will give you a brief speed boost upon landing from a jump, or shaking the Wii-mote/Wheel if using it. Aside from the controls, Mario Kart Wii has a solid list of Characters, Stages, and Vehicles to choose from, all adding combination possibilites for players wishing to experience Heavy and Light Class Racing. The stages on its own can range from spectacular to Mediocre at times, but the Retro courses that are also included also add a nice layer of Nostalgia to Races. Splitscreen Racing and Battle Mode with friends is as fun as its always been, although sometimes the Divisions can make the screen very small for some people. Online can be a drag, because many Hackers and griefers like to mess up peoples fun, but if you look past it, you'll find a solid racing experience.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

There are more characters to choose from, more cars, and now there are motorcycles. There's even an online component to the game that works really well, never once lagging. The only issue with this game is its reliance on chance. No matter how good I got at this game, a blue shell could always best me, leaving me in 8th place. For latter installments, I recommend an item select screen, similar to that of Super Smash Bros, in order to fix this issue.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Matt1251,28-11-2013,"Three words: It's about time. Sorry if it offends anyone, but I didn't like Mario Kart DS. It was too clunky. But then this game took it all back to the way it used to be. The courses are great, the karts are unique, and the graphics are AMAZING. Seriously, once you see your favorite characters on that screen, you never look at them the same way again. The trick element was godly. I find myself replaying tracks just to see what kind of tricks I could do. Once I even did a double corkscrew frontflp. I paused the screen in midair just to look at it. Anyway, back to the review. There are a lot of luck based instances, including the murderous Spiny Shell, but that doesn't ruin the game by any means.

Its a fun racer with great tracks and is one of the few games my family will play with me.

minekartreview9,09-08-2015,"Ok, let me say something, this game (if im not wrong) its the best Mario Kart title ever created, this title would be hard to beat in my opinion, this game had the most enjoyable Wi-Fi Connection servers and the items made this game much enjoyable, it had great twists on the races, making you to lose or to win depending of the circumstances and the AI acted like a real player...

But, why a 9 then?. Actually, this game was ruined by hackers that played on the Wi-Fi Connection game mode, one example of what im saying is that the hacker could win the race without completing the 3 laps, also, they could change their points to make you lose even 500 points. In time trials, some completed the course in less than 1 second (something that is already impossible) and the effort that you put in the time trials was in vain, some people didn't hacked the game, but they achieved a record of 30 seconds in a course, how?. Its simple, the game had to much glitches that helped that players to achieve their record and the glitches were in many tracks...

ItsRaininMen,19-06-2013,"Mario Kart is a game that many people associated with memories, might even think of as nostalgic. It's got a great amount of unlockables, but not so many that you will spend years and years just trying to get them all, some of which are easy to obtain for people who aren't that skilled at driving games, but lots of hard-to-get ones for the pros. It's also a good game when you want to have a less luck based version of coin tossing or drawing straws. It's frustrating enough to make us angry racing beasts, but not so frustrating that we give up on the game. It's a big salad of emotions, but it pretty much just boils down to happiness.

knifeandfork,01-08-2013,"What a disappointment. The latest mario kart should be a 8 or even a 9, but instead it's an example of how one problem can ruin everything. It's a shame because Mario Kart Wii's control system is flawless- the wiimote is the wheel. This is the best addition to the mario kart series to date. Also it contains online, which is another good addition, albeit not as good as it would be on xbox 360 or ps3. All these additions combine to make a very enjoyable new mario kart game. Or should I say they would, if not for the fact you may as well be playing a board game. The amount of items being chucked about and madness happening is enough to put off all but the most casual gamers. Once I was first, just about to finish a gruelling 150cc race, then I got hit by a spiny shell. Now this is infamous in mario kart games, but previously, if you had enough of a lead, you could easily still make it first. Bu tin mario kart wii, when this happens, it is immediately followed by a red shell, and, before you can recover, a green shell. Then a banana lands on your head, then a bob-omb blows you up before you can react, and finally, to finish things off, Bowser barges your still recovering kart off the course. By that time, everyone except you has reached the end, and you are 12th. Not your fault. But tough luck- cos that's all it is: luck. But it's made yet worse in the ferocious rubber-banding. I repeat that it's a real goddamned shame because Mario Kart Wii features excellent use of the wiimote with the wii wheel accessory, and has awesome multiplayer and online options. Which brings me to higlight those. Multiplayer is great. This is partly because one thing that contributes to the unfairness of single-player is the ferocious rubber-banding. But with it gonr in multiplayer, it's a blast. The problem is you have to play through the courses in grand prix to unlock them in multi-player, so you'll need to endure those single-player torture sessions to unlock the fun in this game. A good feature is time trials- where you race on your own against 'ghosts', trying to achieve the high score in that track. This is a great feature as it removes both the rubber banding AND the inclusion of complete chance. Unfortunately, just like in the multi-player, you must win the courses in grand prix to unlock them in time trials. The graphics in Mario Kart Wii, though nothing astounding, are good. Additionally to the main game, there are also balloon battle modes, but they suffer from the same problem that the rest of the game has, unless played multiplayer. But the various soundtracks are lacklustre and the voices of the characters are enough to drive a person crazy. I'm disappointed to have to rate this game a six, but I felt that any initial enjoyment gave way to frustration. Sometimes a wii remote is just not enough.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

psychogrodus,29-08-2013,"Mario Kart Wii isn't the best Mario Kart game, but it sure is close. The wii is the perfect console to have a racing game due to the motion controls and Mario KArt Wii takes full advantage of it. Due to the layout of the wii remote, the controls feel perfect. Granted, you can find more immersive racers out there, but the motion controls due make Mario Kart very immersive. There are more characters in this Mario Kart game then any preceding Mario Kart, in fact it's almost overwhelming. There are more ways to unlock characters now besides winning the grand prix, such as time trials. The courses are some of the best in the series. Highlights include Koopa Cape, Moonview Highway, and one of the best iterations of Rainbow Road. Battle mode is back and is pretty fun. Online play has been improved upon since Mario Kart DS. WIth all this stuff in the game, it's a shock that nearly all of it is flawless. The exception to this is 150cc races. In the 150cc races, the AI cheats big time. The AI will zoom ahead at random points at an absurd speed. This can get ver frustrating. Another problem is the change in local multiplayer. In the last console Mario Kart, Double Dash during local multiplayer the only characters on the course were the players. In Mario Kart Wii however, computers will join in on the races making the local multiplayer less fun. Overall, Mario Kart Wii may not be the best, but it is fun nonetheless.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The obnoxiousness ever so high, especially with the menacing blue shell which seems to wait till you're close to the finish line. In some cases you will be hit with blue shells 4 times in one race! But that's Mario Kart for ya!

There are a lot of OP elements in Mario Kart Wii, such as certain characters on the ninja-styled mach bikes, which seems to be everyones' go-to setup in multiplayer, but that does not break the game.

The online experience is great while the online lobbies and setup are annoying, but once in a race it's fun to race real people. Be ready for some aggravation, this Mario Kart will have you cheering one moment nad throwing your controller the next!",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

CCooombs,05-05-2016,"Mario Kart Wii is a great game, and one that remains a brilliant multiplayer experience even eight years on. There are interesting dynamics throughout many of the courses, such as cows that stumble onto the track and meteors that hail down from volcanoes, and each one adds something unique. While the online has sadly been shut down, it continues to provide plenty of entertainment locally between four friends. The balance between items is well done and even if you feel it isn't, there are always options to turn them off or increase them to ""frantic"". The battle mode is good in its own right, with solid arena courses are character options. This was a real stand out title for the Wii and still holds up today.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

DrewtheDude85,01-04-2014,"Mario Kart Wii is fun and exciting and another Wii game that is essential to buy. It has some really cool characters to play as like in other Mario Karts and the same can be said for the race tracks; my favorite tracks were ""Toad's Factory"", ""DK Summit"", ""Koopa Cape"", ""Maple Treeway"" and ""Bowser's Castle"". New to this game is the ability to play with the Wii Remote in the style of an actual car wheel with it's motion controls; I know some people didn't like that but I liked playing it that way and that was the way I used it the most. There are also other driving styles you could do like the Wii Remote with the Nunchuk, a GameCube controller and a Wii Classic Controller (I will warn you, I played the game with a Classic Controller, and the controls were actually not that great.) The Wi-Fi was also cool, I heard that some people didn't like it because they may have ran into some hackers, but I didn't and it was fairly enjoyable. Overall I really like Mario Kart Wii, I probably think that is one of the better Mario Kart games despite what some people say (some people really hate this game and I don't get that) and I would really recommend it. I still need to get Mario Kart DS and Mario Kart 7, those looks fun! I also look forward to getting Mario Kart 8 when that comes out and I get a Wii U; but for now Mario Kart Wii will tide me over.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
luisflopez,19-05-2018,"Mario Kart Wii is an fantastic entry in the Mario Kart series, despite the hate it usually receives (simply for being a Wii game, I guess). I played it again after ignoring it for 7 years, and turns out it was even better than I remembered it. Now, after playing it for a couple of hours, I can safely say that it is my favorite Mario Kart game (I haven't played 8 though).

First off, bikes are awesome, both aesthetically and gameplay-wise. Handling in this game is very comfortable and responsive (unless you use motion controls, of course. Don’t use motion controls, they make the game so much worse). The mini boosts you gain from performing a stunt after a jump are also a brilliant addition. And so are half-pipes, although I wish these gave you a bit more of a boost, because most of the time choosing to take a half-pipe will just make you lose your position.

The new tracks are really memorable and fun. Koopa Cape, Maple Treeway, Coconut Mall, and Wario’s Gold Mine are good examples that come to my mind. Special mention to MKWii’s Rainbow Road, easily my favorite track in the series so far. The selection of Retro Tracks is good, for the most part.

The roster of characters is simply the best out of all the Mario Kart titles, including MK8. Go ahead and try to deny it. All of the best Mario characters are here, and the newcomers are awesome too (well, except for the babies).

The selection of karts and bikes is also the greatest in the whole series by far. All of the vehicles are so memorable, creative and cool looking. And they have a unique skin for each of the characters, which I really appreciate. This is one of my favorite aspects of MKWii, the variety of character + vehicle combinations.

Another very positive consequence of having so many characters and vehicles is that you’re going to be unlocking something all the time. This makes playing through the game feel very rewarding, because you’re always unlocking an new character or vehicle for everything you do. Even for playing time trial and beating staff ghosts. This is greatly appreciated by a single player type like me.

Some people complain that the items in this game are unbalanced and chaotic. I used to think the same when I played it 7 years ago, but now they felt just fine to me. In fact, I think MKWii has probably the most balanced set of items in the series. I’m sad to see all of the excellent new items gone in subsequent MK games. Yes, that includes the POW Block and the Thunder Cloud.

I’m sad I didn’t make it in time to try the online mode, but I imagine it must have been tons of fun. So overall, Mario Kart Wii is a very solid entry in the series. Excellent as always for multiplayer, and probably the best Mario Kart experience for single player.

Score: 8.8",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

cwepahguy225,05-07-2014,"This is a pretty good game. I like the diversity of the character roster. However, things were too hard to unlock, and should be easier. The items are imbalanced, once I got hit by all three red shells from triple reds. The multiplayer was fun, but Nintendo had to DISCONTINUE IT. The battle mode was good, I just wish you could do a vehicle besides the standard kart and bike. What made me come back though, was the vs. The team vs was great, I'm mad that they didn't bring the team vs into mk7 and mk8. The real donwside is the lack of vehicle parts. Customization was introduced in mk7 and brought into mk8, but you have to use just a body in mario kart wii. It didn't feel very personal, and the vehicles felt underpowered. I also didlike how vechicles are limited to weight, and not for all characters. The biggest downside is that this game has no creative element. It's pretty straightforward, there's no anti-gravity, underwater racing, hang gliding, etc, because of this the tracks felt boring.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
GypsyPeach,19-08-2014,"Really fun multiplayer game....of course, it's Mario Kart, that's sort of expected. However, although I love Mario Kart (despite the fact I can't drive for garbage) I do have some problems with it that are minor but they are annoyances. For example, the computers get TONS of ""POW""s, blue shells, and are surprisingly accurate with green shells. Their AI is annoying especially when racing on teams because they still push each other and the human player ends up dragging the rest of the computer team. Banana peels and boxes are not nearly as effective as they used to be and there's this new lightning cloud thing that should not be there at all as it's not helpful for the player, it's just devastating...

Still, these are all minor things. Most of the tracks are good. The controls are good, music is what I expect in a Mario Kart... it's all there and it's still fun. I'd just recommend trying to get more human players so there are less stupid computers at least when you play team racing. Good game, lots of fun.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Kai82,11-09-2014,An incredible fun racing game. It is really good in single player mode but with friends in multiplayer mode it is just awesome. There are some points which prevent a 10/10.

If you played one of the previous game you will enjoy it except for the blue shell ;-).,9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Rubinglass,11-09-2014,"This is my least favorite Mario Kart game. I like parts of it, but those parts are scattered all over the place and don't really add up to my experience enough to make this a positive review. I liked the graphics, and the tracks had amazing design for the most part.
The motion controls felt difficult to adapt to, they were a bit too unpolished for me to enjoy. I won't way this with 100 % certainty, though, since it could be that the Wiimote fell out of sync, but even when recently synced it still felt kind of unresponsive. The wii wheel was placed in a dark corner never to be used again (that's not really true, I tried it out some more times asking myself ""was it really that bad?"", but each time it returned to that dark corner of the room). Playing with the Gamecube-controller worked fine, however. A bit slippery, but drifting nullified the slipperiness.
I don't get why they went back to one-character-per-kart. Double-Dash felt fun and fresh in that sense, you could combine characters that gave you a tactical advantage. Replacing this feature with bikes felt like a weird choice to me, but I can also understand that the developers would want to experiment and bring in new features. It would have been fun to have as an option though.
I think my major problem with it was the items. They feel unbalanced and since you don't recover fast you can get whacked by combos and go from a big lead to last place in mere seconds. It isn't skill-based either, just random. It's frustrating to say the least. If this was single player only, I'd give it a 2/10.
However, there is multiplayer, which is this game's redeeming quality. While I still prefer Double-Dash's multiplayer options of either cooperating (on the same cart, mind you) or competing with your friends and play entire cups together, Wii didn't disappoint. I had some fun time with this game (as well as times of face-palming), but when a friend suggests a go of Mario Kart, this is not the version we turn to firsthand.",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

numbermaniac,10-01-2015,"It appears that most of the games I own on my Wii have gotten a bit boring, but Mario Kart Wii, even after 6 years, still has not. The system that controls items is wonderful, giving more powerful items to those at the back but less powerful items to those at the front, making sure that the players at the back still have a chance. Races are fast, even though they don't feel very fast, some of those 32 tracks do really put you on the edge with those obstacles. With 16 of those tracks from older Mario Kart releases you can see what the game was like previously, but there are still 16 new tracks that are magnificent. There's so much to unlock in this game that it takes, well, a very long time to unlock everything. 6 years and still there's one more character and a few more vehicles I have to unlock. Well designed, and fun for everyone.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
DBPirate1129,10-01-2015,"Mario Kart Wii is an absolute blast to play complete with fantastic new courses, the best cast of characters in the series, and superb multiplayer. The amount of controllers available to use in the game is astounding and the battle mode is as hectic and fun as ever! This is perhaps one of the most underrated games in the Mario Kart series and it's hard to see why.

Though the online isn't functional at the time of this review, it was still fun while it lasted and I never had any lag or internet connection problems which is a rarity in most of the games I play. One of the downsides in the game is how much luck plays into your races. When racing on 150cc, you will be constantly bombarded by Blue Shells, POW Blocks, and the like. It can be really frustrating and may ruin the experience for some.

The game more than makes up for this in the quality of its courses. While some of the retro picks are questionable, the new courses are simply amazing. Standouts include Maple Treeway, Koopa Cape, Coconut Mall, DK Summit, Dry Dry Ruins, and Rainbow Road. The latter is an extremely tricky course and can be difficult to master.

Overall, Mario Kart Wii is an enjoyable experience with fantastic courses, multiplayer, and reparability but the items can be a bit too harsh and luck-oriented. Still, in my opinion, the game is better than its successor Mario Kart 7 and provides a fun family-friendly experience.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The racing tracks are some of the best I have ever played, the music is awesome, the visuals are pretty neat, and the races are A TON of fun even in singleplayer. I know many people hate the fact that this game is a bit unbalanced item-wise, but for me, that just makes it even more fun to play, due to making races unpredictable. The motion controls are very nicely made, and the battle mode is the best. I just wish characters were a bit more decent and that the game had a Missions mode.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
thealexmott,26-03-2017,"The worst console Mario Kart game. Whether you're steering with motion controls or with a nunchuk, the controls are floaty and leave a lot to chance. There is NO co-op Grand Prix mode, something MK8 thankfully fixed, which is a huge problem. Mario Kart games are fun for multiplayer, but the most fun for me was always playing through the game with a friend and unlocking everything.

The biggest shame is how much there is to unlock. There's a ton of it! It's fantastic! And you have to unlock characters like Funky Kong by doing genuinely difficult things! MK8 and Smash 4 have gone to the opposite end of the unlocking spectrum and practically give you everything, which I really don't like.

""Most"" of the tracks in this game are really good and well designed except Rainbow Road (That one god damn turn). Anyway the battle mode was mode fleshed out this time around with battle being 3 minutes long (Which is how I like it), being split into two teams and have 10 battle courses (5 being new & 5 being old). The one thing I got to praise this game for is having 12 players in both offline/online, speaking of online it ran a good frame rate with little to no lag and F.Y.I. I personally did like the point system in this game instead of the other two games.

gilbertboy,01-10-2017,"Mario Kart Wii is my favorite game of all time. The driving is so smooth and fun, that I always would play with friends and online. The tracks are some of my favorite in the series. The character roster is easily the best in the series including, King Boo, Toadette, Diddy Kong, and of course Funky Kong! The vehicles are my favorite in the series. The customizable vehicles sound interesting at first because of the options, but especially in Mario Kart 8 many parts all function the same. Although the online play has been shut down for 3 years, people have made their own servers to play together. The community is still thriving and there is no doubt you won't be able to find at least 150 players online at a time. However, with all these positives why not a ten? Well, lap count glitches damper down some online matches because you cant race if someone gets done with a track in 30 seconds, and the fact that karts and outward drifting bikes aren't as good.

Most tracks are good, such as Mushroom Gorge, Maple Treeway, DK Summit, Toad's Factory, Moonview Highway, and Grumble Volcano, though these are held back by mediocre tracks such as Moo Moo Meadows and Dry Dry Ruins. It has a decent retro track selection, including SNES Ghost Valley 2, DS Desert Hills, GCN Waluigi Stadium, N64 Bowser's Castle, etc. It also has great shortcut design, and is a very skill-based game. So why not an 8 or 9? Some tracks are boring, and most of the time items don't even work, such as red shells and fake item boxes. Red shells hit walls most of the time, and fake item boxes are too easy to see unless you use them efficiently, simple as that. It's very fun though.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
KrimsonKatt,10-01-2019,"This is by far one of the best games ever made, and 100% deserves it's feat of over 50 million copies sold. The game has the best selection of tracks in the Mario Kart series, a ridiculous amount of fun unlockables, the best online on the Wii, (while it was still a thing) none of the stupid cart customization stuff from 7 and 8, a decent level of challenge, (It's actually hard to get SSS, and even S is extremely difficult) a great battle mode, and is by far the best game on the Wii. (Maybe other than Xenoblade 1, but that't 1 player only and I consider that more of a Wii U/3DS game due to it releasing in limited quantities in the US until recently.) If you have a Wii, or even a Wii U lying around, it's worth keeping just for this game alone. The only bad things I can say about it is that the physics aren't as refined and the graphics aren't as good as 8 and 8 DX on the Wii U and Switch. Also there were an abundance of hackers on both this game as well as the previous game Mario Kart DS. They used illegal home-brew consoles with cheats like infinite blue shells, every item at any time, extra speed, auto steering, and instant Lakitu making beating them impossible. Other than that, I could easily recommend this game who feels like the newer games lack in content, or just have an itch for a different Mario Kart experience.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

clem666,05-03-2021,"Certainly an unavoidable classic to have and play on the Wii console. This game rocked so many young generations. There are a lot of easter eggs, hidden characters and paths. It is a true delight to play it with friends and especially if you are certain that this will not break your relationships. The graphics are okay, the original score is great and fun when the beats accelerate when you are on the final lap. There are a lot of varied maps with varied power-ups and atmospheres. The 'stoy mode' (if we can call it that way) is okay, the difficulty goes crescendo and kind of frustrated me when I was a kid trying to finish the game. The modes are varied and funny. The possibility to play it online was amazing at that time and particularly the fact that you could post your best time trial online to compare you with the rest of the world. Well that was awesome before everyone started to cheat.

The main flaw of this game is that power-ups can influence the race way too much. You could have the best driving skills of your family, you could also finish last if you get on a chain of bad events (which happens way too often to me). If you add this to the fact that the RNG is totally controlled and not so random according to your place on the classification it quickly loses the fun it had.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Chippy-T,07-08-2019,"Nintendo did good with this game, on paper this game should be awful due to its inability to incorporate skill into the mix, but somehow, it works wonderfully. The TLDR is that it is an extremely fun game with an amazing community and a lot of replay value.

But here is the main/bulk of the review. I am going to split the review up into different sections.

1. Gameplay
2. Graphics
3. Music
4. Community

Gameplay: The gameplay is quite simple. There is no hour-long tutorial, no text on screen telling you ""Do this! Do that!"" you press A 4 times and you are in the game. It is that simple.

Once you get into a race, that's where the game shows a few flaws, mainly in the items. The item system makes it so 1st place has only bananas and other weak items to defend themselves with, meaning that only the skilled get to keep 1st place, and 12th (last place) has more powerful items to push themselves into 1st. The issue comes when players actually play the game. One of the first things you will notice is that most of the hectic action is in the middle so 1st and 12th are the safest places to be, also if you are skilled enough to keep 1st place then you are going to be so far ahead that only blue shells and a really good red shell are going to post any threat to you.

Another good thing is the online mode, now technically this can't affect the score any more as the online got shut down and now you have to mod in the online mode. But from what I can remember (and from what I played on the online mode) it was/is really fun and makes the 20+ hours of gameplay turn into months! (and that's not an exaggeration!)

2. Graphics

The graphics are actually where the game fails the most. They haven't improved all that much from the days of the GameCube, personally, I think the graphics are great, they aren't so bad that it affects gameplay, but it would have been nice to see a major upgrade to them.

3. Music

This is where the game stands out the most! The music in this game is so good. The frantic, adrenaline-filled, grumble volcano and the sparkle of coconut mall (along with all the other tracks) makes this game a charm to listen to! In most games, your music is based on the theme or main mechanic of the game, if you have something like dark souls you won't be having much uplifting music because you are trying to maintain an atmosphere. But with Mario Kart, it treats every track like it was its own game! Since there are so many different locations, so many different settings, it meant that they really got to experiment with the music and really turn it into something that I love. I would listen to the songs outside of the game itself, and I think most people would too.

4. Community

Though not as large as it used to be, the community is amazing. They have done some amazing things with this game! Wiimm, along with other community figures, created wiimmfi which, after the shutdown of the online mode, revived the online community almost instantly! Loads of other community members are creating content like custom tracks and music to keep the game fresh and original, MR. Bean created CTGP which helped people easily access the online mode and helped people easily gain access to hundreds of custom tracks.

The speedrunning community is still semi-active, and even though most of the tricks and shortcuts have been found these guys still manage to keep the game alive and keep on making there times shorter and shorter.

SUMMERY

The game has a lot of playtime, and when modding in some of the extra content the community provides the game gets thousands of hours longer. The music is good and the graphics are nic-

LouistheHelms,03-10-2022,"Coming from someone who hasn't played Double Dash, or the GBA title, or Super Mario Kart, PLUS this being a game I played an obscene amount of in my childhood... This game is brilliant.

Not to overinflate, but this game kind of has everything.
- The UI is charming. It feels like it's from the future
- The roster is pretty respectable, a decent spread of Mario characters (I think I speak for everyone when I say WHERE'S SHY GUY)
- The new tracks in this game are so iconic (CNut Mall, Mushroom Gorge, Wario's GMine, etc.)
- The music is great
- I like it

There are maybe two slights I could recognize against this game (one of which is easily fixed):
- The models and a few animations are reused from Double Dash
- Waggle controls (just play with a gamecube controller (or w/ nunchuck))

Either way, pretty terrific game. I'd be surprised if Nintendo could top it. Maybe in 4 or so years when they come out with a new Mario Kart it'll be as spectacular.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Online features, despite awful hacking moderation (Time trial leaderboards full of hackers back then), have been great while they lasted until Wii Connect 24's shutdown.

The Nitro courses offer a complete, challenging and entertaining experience, and they all deserve to be memorable in their own way: about the Retro courses, i disagree about two or three picks, but overall the selection is quite nice (i love that they included DS Delfino Square).
There are a lot of characters and vehicles to unlock, and for a few of them some serious skill is required (like the ones you receive by getting a star rating in all Nitro/Retro cups on a certain CC difficulty).

So many things that will screw me over are things beyond my control. Oh I got first on the first 3 tracks of a Grand Prix, well that sucks cause I’m gonna get hit with 15 different items at the end of the 4th race so I score really poorly and don’t get a first place trophy and a 3 star rank.

The tracks are fantastic, the variety is great, and the game play is superb! And don't even get me started about the online capabilities this game has. This amazing game is surprisingly underrated and I still play this game until this very day.
Sure their are a few glitches and broken shortcuts, but that's what makes this game fun. This game takes mario kart to another level, adding the trick system and bikes for the first time. Without this game, Mario kart wouldn't be what it is today.
They also re-use the character models from 'Mario kart: Double Dash!!' in this game, but it makes up for that with its great game play.
The one thing I'm sorta sad about though is that they got rid of the missions from Mario kart DS. If they kept that one thing, this game would undoubtedly be one of the best games ever made.
But apart from that, this game is still absolutely fantastic and the limits are endless...

ChierHu,07-02-2021,"Give the losers a break: Mario Kart is famous for its unusual system of giving out power-ups. Players who are ahead in the race get meager power-ups, while players who are far behind get the good stuff, allowing them to race ahead. This is a great system for that game because it feels more fair and keeps everyone engaged: players who are behind need to pay attention because a game-changing power-up could come at any second, and players who are ahead cannot afford to rest on their laurels because that “blue shell” could hit them at any time. This tricky system does a great job at nudging all players to the center of the flow channel.
Mario Kart is a symphony of triangularity. Again and again, it brings you high-risk/low-risk choices with appropriate payoffs. Examples include the following:
Manual or automatic? Manual requires more skill to use, but when used well, it gives you more speed boosts.
Kart or bike? Karts have a faster base speed—but if you do a wheelie on a bike (which is risky because you can’t turn during a wheelie), you go faster than the karts do.
Grab power-ups? (risking a crash) or ignore them?
Use power-ups? (risk breaking your concentration) or ignore them?
Keep the power-up you’ve got? or dump it in favor of a new one?
Use speed boost pads? They speed you up but tend to be in dangerous locations.
Hit the gas early? If you hit the gas early at the starting line, you get a speed boost if you time it right, and a frustrating delay if you time it wrong.
Left or right? Many tracks include forking tracks that have a low-risk and high-risk path—and of course the high-risk path has more speed boosts.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Chebic,05-04-2021,"TLDR; Great tracks, mediocre character/kart selection, and amazing modding community

Before I begin I'd like to note Mario Kart Wii is my first ever video game (or at least one of my first) and that I've only played 3 other Mario Karts, DS and 8 in specific. So obviously I may be slightly blinded by nostalgia and may not know the true peaks of Mario Kart and consequently can't fully judge this game perfectly.

Nevertheless this game is quite amazing. All of the tracks are incredible, it's so fun to just mess around with friends on, it had the biggest character roster of all the games at the time, AND it has Funky Kong. You can't really go wrong with this one, I only have two major complaints. First is the battle mode, it's notoriously one of the worst of all time, you're forced to play with teams, you're forced to have a timer, and elimination doesn't even affect players. It's really bad. The second is the stat balancing, notoriously this game has the funky/flame runner combo that straight up dominates the meta. Now while I do definitely dislike this I must chime in and note that while Funky/Flame is the objective best it's not by a lot, every character is near identical bar one or two stats they've been boosted in and all the inside drift bikes are relatively competitively viable. In total this causes this criticism to only take effect in extremely competitive races where you need to take every advantage you can get. There's also the extreme randomness everyone seems to complain about but from personal experience the item distribution seems to be pretty fine excluding the rare case when you are blue shelled nine times and then red shelled another five.

Now for most games I'd end their, probably rate it an 8/10 for being a great party racing game but having a pretty shallow battle and competitive mode, but instead the masssive Mario Kart Wii fandom that somehow manages to still grow has got me their. Maybe this is cheating a little but I wholheartedly believe the fandom makes this game 10x better. The shear quantity of mods is insane. CTGP-R, the largest and most popular mod, adds over 216 new tracks. For reference that is almost 7 Mario Kart Wii's worth of new tracks. Obviously not all are the best but the meager fact that MKWii has such a massive modding scene that you could possibly septuply the amount of content by downloading one mod is insane, this isn't even accounting for all the new game modes that totally shake up the formula these mods also add. The modding scene is so massive that at least half of the people still playing this game are almost always using some mod. It's crazy to me how massive the modding scene is for this game and due to just how much it adds to the game it immediately bumps it up a number.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
BeeSting1,01-01-2021,"The most RNG heavy Mario Kart.

RNG ruined this game. Even if you drive perfectly, you have virtually no chance of winning if you get hit by a blue shell near the end of the final lap. The game includes no way to prevent a blue shell, further removing skill required to come first. You can also get combo'd by a string of items afterwards, further securing your loss. It's a frustrating waste of time trying to get Gold Cups in Grand Prix. If you enjoy playing slot machines in casinos, you'll like Mario Kart Wii. Some luck is fun, but too much luck is not. It becomes mindless and stupid. That's what Mario Kart Wii is to me. I rather flip a coin and guess the outcome than play this game.

Bikes were a good addition. Although they were unbalanced and obsoleted karts, which mattered more in multiplayer. The wheelie ability added depth to the game. You can speed boost, but can be risky since there's a deceleration punishment if you get hit during the wheelie.",7,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Die Fahrer und Fahrzeugauswahl ist ebenfalls größtenteils gut gelungen. Die Mii-Charaktere hätte es in diesem Spiel zwar nicht benötigt, aber wer will es Nintendo verübeln ihre neuen Avatare in einen als großen System-Seller geplanten Funracer einzubringen. Ich bin kein großer Freund der Bikes in Mario Kart Wii, da sie viel zu overpowered sind. Wer würde denn noch ein Kart benutzen, wenn er auch ein Bike fahren kann, mit welchem er dank dem Wheelie schneller ist, als ein Kart mit goldenem Drift-Boost ist. Der blaue Panzer kommt hier auch ein wenig zu häufig vor, allgemein würde ich das Spiel als ein wenig unfair einstufen, vor allem die Bepunktung des Onlinemodus war sehr hart.

Supermarios05,07-12-2021,"I can't think of a more active and enterprising game than MKW. And there will surely be a reason for that.

Released in 2006, MKW became a staple of the Wii generation, becoming the best-selling racing game at the time (now surpassed by MK8D). But, over time, the community learned more about this game, which became, and still is, the most dynamic game in MK. But this also depends on very solid foundations.
Gameplay is clear and fun, with an intuitive approach suited to casual gamers. Nintendo has promoted the Wii Mote with the Wii Wheel, a reproduction of a steering wheel that is quite uncomfortable. I honestly prefer to go with Nunchack, but I recommend you get a classic controller. Anyway, the reason the game is mostly known for introduced mechanics, like the trick (I can't see a previous MK in the same way anymore) and the bikes. The latter vehicles have the advantage of wheeling, giving a speed boost, while the karts are introduced, for balanced, a second orange miniturbo faster than the normal one. Despite the efforts, the bikes are OP compared to the machines and should always be preferred. Indeed, the Mach Bike and Moto Bowser always make it a priority for their excellent characteristics.
Items are totally chaotic: having no immunity after a hit, you can be repeatedly run over. The new items are nice additions and weak interludes to existing items: the POW is a weaker lightning bolt, the Mega Mushroom is a weaker star. The storm cloud is a controversial addition, but not a bad one.
The Characters Roster is without a doubt the best of the series, only behind MKT. The characters are balanced and no presence out of place or even just seems out of place. Then there is Funky Kong: only he would justify the 10!
The tracks in this game are great and memorable: Coconut Mall, Toad Factory, Rainbow Road and many more. The choice of the retro is not one of the best, but it is still really well done.
Time Trials is challenging, thanks to the 2 difficulty Nintendo-made ghosts, easy and expert.
Battle Modes features a total of 12 arenas, but it doesn't compare to MK8D, featuring only Balloon Battle and Coin Runner.

But what makes the game so great is its large community. It is still possible to play online (thanks to a mod), where you can ALWAYS find players. A very popular expansion allows you to give the game more than 200 unreleased tracks created by users, including totally new tracks, recreation of old or new tracks compared to MKW and even tracks from other games. It is possible to play in 200 displacement and play with 24 players rather than the original 12. But you can also find a mod that reproduces hide and seek and one that can rebalance vehicles already in the game.
The competitive scene is challenging, thanks in part to many unwanted shortcuts that give the game an eternal discovery: you never know what you can find new.

Is Mario Kart Wii the best game in the series? Yes. The game itself is great, with great tracks, great roster, great gameplay and great incentive to replay it. But thanks to the work of the fans, the game manages to be even better and to exploit its potential to 1000%. I can't recommend the game more than that.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

This Mario Kart isn't a 10/10 game and there a few reasons for that. 1.This game is broken, there are shortcuts that can basically break this game entirely and that's what I love about Mario Kart Wii. 2.This is probably the fairest Mario Kart for offline and online multiplayer. Offline it practically makes sure you catch up with people in front of you so easily. Online it's a bit different, but around the same as it is offline. Mario Kart Wii does have a nice replay factor with homebrew hacks nowadays, which gives it a better chance at surviving for a long time. 3. It's got the stuff there like time trials, grand prix, vs, and battle mode, there's a lot to explore even if it can be annoying at some times.

Kdog152,09-01-2023,"If we're being realistic, Mario kart Wii is overrated. so, let's start with the negatives so they are done and dusted.
- The online is horrendous! It's laggy. It's full of hackers who constantly use the mind boggling amount of game-breaking short cut glitches and item hacks in this game. That leads to my next point:
- This game is Brocken, though thankfully, you have to go out of your way to break the game.
- The item distribution is horrible. The amount of times you get hit by red shells and other projectiles is ridiculous.
- Why does Luigi's circuit exists? the track is bland and it has a section at the end where it punishes the player for driving on the boost panels as they make you slower, WHICH DEFEATS THE WHOLE POINT OF A BOOST PANNAL!!!
- Funky Kong. Surely that's all I need to say. No? well then let me explain. Funky Kong has the most annoying voice, to the point where if the volume is up loud, it will make your ears bleed. (well, okay, not really, but you get the point).
now with the positives:
With the exception of Luigi circuit, the tracks are amazing and were some of the most creative in the series at the time. Maple Treeway, Coopa Cape, grumble volcano and the hardest rainbow road in the series are only a few of them. It's no wonder it was the best selling Mario kart until 8 deluxe came out 9 years later.
- The amount of karts in the game are great
-The battle mode is fun, but I don't like the fact that racers respawn after all their balloons are popped and also Hate the fact that we now have a timer now. You can customise it, but not by much. However, it does have a big collection of tracks and some good ones at that.
-The introduction of bikes is also a nice touch.
-This kinda in the middle when it comes to praise and criticism: It has some great retro tracks like GCN DK Mountain, Ds peach gardens, Ds Delphino Squair and N64 Bowsers castle, but it also had some really bad ones like Ds Yoshi circuit and N64 Mario raceway. it's a mixed bag.
the character roster is huge and the best in the series.
7.5 out of 10.
- Getting skilled at this game is so rewarding and local multi-player is great.
Overall though, Mario kart Wii is still an amazing game for the Wii and it does deserve the score it got.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

EvanatorB,23-11-2022,"Mario Kart Wii may be the best Mario Kart game to date. The roster doesn’t have filler characters, the tracks are creative and colorful, and it’s soundtrack ties the experience together perfectly. The gameplay itself has aged greatly and gives you the option of making it as hard or as easy as you want it to be. Grandma can play just to have fun and a more hardcore gamer will enjoy learning tricks and shortcuts every track has to offer. Everything from physics, to drifting and doing tricks mid-air or performing a wheelie on a bike feels great, no matter what control scheme you use. (Wii Remote, Wii Wheel, Pro Controller) The only thing wrong with the game is the graphics look similar to a GameCube game, rather than a Wii game, however the cartoony art style of the game doesn’t really need hyper realistic visuals. In conclusion, This game represents everything great about the Nintendo Wii.",10,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The music for it is so good and It is super fun with friends too. but a lot of times it can get annoying or frustrating. The controls for the game are dumb and can sometimes hurt your hands. Items can be really dumb like getting a bomb in 3rd or getting a green shell in 8th. but I like this game because it stupid.

It is full of a lot fun a creative courses, it is amazing playing this game with friends. It may not have some of the ""bells and whistles"" that the later Mario Karts have, but I still enjoyed it very much. I loved the fact that you can have two characters on one Kart, however I do think that they should have at least had the option to play it traditionally as well, but I did like that they used that and I think that should make it return to a future.

SonicSpeedo92,21-06-2018,"Mario Kart Double Dash reinvents the wheel with two people in one kart. This means that Mario Kart becomes more strategic, because you can switch between items if you get an item box for each character. And that's not all. Each duo has a unique special item. These range from fireballs, to big bananas, and huge Bowser shells. And the tracks are some of the best in the series. DK Mountain, Wario Colosseum, and Daisy Cruiser are examples. My only gripe is the controls, but you'll get used to them eventually. The battle mode is also amazing to play with friends. Whether you're playing Shine Thief in Pipe Plaza, Balloon Battle in Luigi's Mansion, or Bob-omb Blast on a freaking Nintendo GameCube, Battle Mode is always frantic and fun. Mario Kart Double Dash is fun for everyone. Definitely the best multiplayer game for the GameCube (NOTE: I haven't played Super Smash Bros. Melee yet).",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Tokyochuchu,22-04-2012,"Mario Kart: Double Dash is a solid kart racer that does what it sets out to do. It's fun in multiplayer and quite entertaining as a solo experience too. It is missing the 'x factor', though. It's not something you can put your finger on, exactly, just a notion that the game isn't as fun as it should be. The N64 Mario Kart had that special ingredient and so did the DS version. This Gamecube iteration misses the mark in that regard and flounders in the company of it's more durable brethren. Basically speaking, this is a descent game but there are much better karting games available.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

RickN.,06-12-2003,I went out and purchased MK:DD. I wasa expecting a completely new game. Unfortunatly it borrows too many elements from the older Mario Kart games. It felt almost identical to the N64 version. The things they added seem tacked on and could have been overlooked if it didn't seem recyled with a new plastic wraper. I saw the broadband insignia on the back so I assumed that they finnally released another online game... not to be true I'm afraid. They turned it into LAN. How many people would drag 4 TV 4 Gamecubes and 4 Disks just to use the LAN feature? Not many I'm sure. I would of liked to give it a better score but I simply can't bring myself to eaise it any higher. Sorry.,4,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Mauhiho,23-02-2013,"This game is horrible. Why? Well let me tell you this. First up, the controls. The controls are HORRIBLE.
Your characters move all over the place while driving, resulting in colliding with walls, CPU players or even items you would normally easily avoid like bananas or shells. Second, the tracks. They are not designed well and some of them are actually really frustrating (Like the Wario Stadium or the ice stage). Next up is the soundtrack. For me, soundtrack is the most important thing in a video game and yeah.. that is lacking in this one. Not memorable at all and some are just a pain to listen to. The only real good soundtrack in the game comes from Rainbow Road, the final track in the game. It's also the only acceptable race track in the game. Next up are the graphics, which are honestly not that bad! Colorfull and sparkling, they really take full advantage of the GameCube capabilities. So yeah.. finally a positive thing about the game haha. Next up is the difficulty IT IS INSANE. Due to the bad controls you will swing back and forth in the track, making it almost impossible to get even first in the 100 CC Cups.
Plus the bad designed race tracks adding it all up makes for a very frustrating experience. The CPU will CRUSH you if you can't handle the controls and that's exactly what's gonna happen to new players to the Mario Kart series. Lastly the replay value. Like in Mario Kart 64, you can play the 50 CC, 100 CC and 150 CC all of which are easy or terribly hard, depending which one you choose. 50 CC is the easiest while the unlockable Mirror Mode is the hardest. But other than that, there is nothing else you can do in the game but that is understandable in a Mario Kart game; It was so before in the past so I won't call it a negative point. In conslusion, Mario Kart: Double Dash!! is one of the worst games i've ever played in my life. Bad controls, bad camera angle, bad level design, frustrating AI and forgettable soundtrack makes this one kart game you DON'T want to ride.",3,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

JayE,10-08-2009,"If you are under 10 years old or if you play the game with your little kids, then you will like this game. If you are 15+ after a beefed up sequel to MK:64, it wont appeal to you. The gameplay is too simple and there is virtually no skill involved. Winning generally depends on what items you get. Its a family game, not a racing game. Mario Kart 64 and SNES are much better games, they have proper karts and require of skill and reflexes to master, and have that classic Mario Kart atmosphere. Dislikes: Crying babies, driving prams and other weird vehicles, no karts!, everything is too cutesy, unable to jump while power sliding, the frustrating item bashing from the CPU players when you are ahead, dull gameplay, cannot hold items behind you. Nintendo should have taken MK:64, kept the same gameplay and dynamics, updated the graphics and made longer tracks, and added more content.

Where's the more complicated challenging tracks (even on the original the second cup started getting difficult - so such luck here)? Battle mode sucks! Where's the levels with elements to hide in or steer around when you're being chased - they're too small to do anything in (and that Gamecube level is a total waste and lazy programming). Good graphics, sound and initially I was pleased but the hard turn without the hop doesn't feel right and makes it less precise than it previously was.

AngryMan,25-07-2015,"This is the worst game I've ever raced. After analyzing this game with a team of Nascar racers, we've all come to the unanimous conclusion that this game is painfully unrealistic and dangerous to the young and stupid minds of our children. Allow me to elaborate.

This game teaches our children that driving recklessly and drive-by shooting is okay. It also teaches them that spending time with a kidnapping turtle on steroids and a barrel-throwing monkey is the right thing to do.

Contrary to what you might believe, it is physically impossible to drive a car on a rainbow. Maybe if the creators had actually done their homework, they could have avoided such gross mistakes in the capabilities of refracted light.

I don't approve of this game having unlockable characters and maps. It's clear that they should have had all content available for purchase. Cause if there is one thing I love, it's buying a game and then forking over even more money to the developers so that my character can wear a blue cowboy hat instead of a green one. I only had to spend 14 bucks on this game! What a ripoff! I should have had to give over at least 30 more.

I also hate that this game involves teamwork by allowing two people to drive/operate the same kart! I hate teamwork, I hate all my friends, and I don't need to be reminded how frustratingly lonely I am! Get your head in the game Nintendo. No one will ever buy any of your games unless you start making good content. I don't even know what a Nintendo is!

So if I'm playing online, I'm playing something in those genres. Racing is best when you have your friends over and can talk smack face to face. Bottom line, Mario Kart 64 was one of the best games I've played in terms of replayability, ease of use (good for novice buddies and girlfriends to pick-up when you're hanging out), and fun.

It feels much more fluid and fast, the courses are better and the double characters add more variety, strategy and weapons to the game. The Gamecube's awesome controller (still to this day it's the best) makes racing easy on the hands and snaking easy on the thumb unlike in Mario Kart DS with the D pad. The gameplay with 2 characters and all the special items makes this a much more exciting and multiplayer suited game over Mario Kart DS. While I like Mario Kart DS still, it feels slightly more generic compared to Double Dash. The graphics in this game are also awesome to look at and it all runs at 60fps with no lag. I don't know how this got 79 on IGN because it really is a definite improvement over the N64 one....I wouldn't call it a mediocre effort at all.

However after giving it a go, I realised that this game IS a mario kart game and a good change. The 2 characters add a lot more variety because each character has their own special items plus you can store items with one character and save them for when you need it...meanwhile using the other character. It's great fun, vivid, sharp and bright graphics and controls perfectly. Jonathon Q, I'm afraid you just didn't play it long enough. It's not generic....if anything the new Mario Kart Wii is generic.

I personally like this better than Mariokart Wii, because the tracks are better and the double character/double weapon game mechanic puts some strategy into the fast paced crazy racing action. Also there is no better game to play with three other friends via splitscreen. Also you and a buddy can get on the same cart while two other buddies team up on another cart and then you concentrate on driving while the guy in the back is the ""weapons man"". Not so fun as a one player experience, but a complete and utter blast to play on multiplayer!

I love the two person kart mechanic where you can mix and match two characters and karts together plus the added teamwork with another player, the gameplay is ridiculously hectic and fun, the track selection is one of the best in the series and graphics still holds up to this day.

Arguably more so than any other entry in the franchise races in Double Dash can be decided based on how lucky you are with the special items you pick up.

If you're a big Mario Kart fan you may be wondering what is different this time around. Well, two big things: a co-op option and Special Items. The co-op option is usually more fun than single player and special items usually make for chaos. Especially DK's giant banana and Bowser's Bowser shell (a gigantic koopa shell). Probably the best Mario Kart of its time.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

FaloRoy,07-01-2013,"I am a fan of racing games, and I have to say Double Dash is much better than what some of those purists are giving it credit for. The tracks are very well designed, and don't have those lame glitches the N64 version had. The music is great as well as the beautiful graphics. Since there is not hop to the drift, the controls are much better than in the previous versions, and just as good as recent Mario Kart games. The game is actually quite fast, but it just feels slow because the tracks are wide and the turning is not as violent. While 150cc is not as fast as previous games, believe me when I say that the game is still exciting. The co-op feature is not the gimmick some say it is either, it simply involves thinking things through and adds an element of strategy. I can mix and match different teams of the 20 characters. Single player is very worthwhile with the unlockables and different team combinations. Multiplayer is fun with more modes and a very workable LAN multiplayer. A few annoyances make this game less than perfect, however. The single player mode only has two modes (no free run?), and the characters voice overs will repeat themselves, a lot. I think the purists hate this game because it tried to be different or that the co-op feature requires a thought process, in which they show scorn for not being as simple as usual. This really is one of the better Mario Karts out there. The character list is great, tracks are awesome, and the 2 to a vehicle is not as frustrating as some say it is. While I do consider DS the best version, I have no problem with those that say this is the best. Very fun, and much better than the N64 or Wii versions. 9.1/10.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Greenicey,20-05-2014,"Mario Kart Double Dash shines it's brightest in it's multiplayer modes. The two players per kart dynamic is not only inventive, but adds a whole new layer to gameplay even when you are in single player. Ihope that Nintendo brings back this mechanic some way, somehow.... The actual gameplay is also some of the best the series has seen, the slide works very well (I don't miss the hop), and nothing about it feels awkward as was the issue with MK64. The game looks relatively simple but has aged quite nicely, and looks as cartoony as ever. The music is kind of catchy, but I would not put it up there with the best. The courses themselves are a wee bit bland at times with some tracks being extremely wide with not a lot going on compared to others. However there are many memorable tracks such as Baby Park, DK Mountain, and Waluigi Stadium. Battle mode in this game is only available in multiplayer, but is an absolute blast to play in my opinion. Overall I think this is one the strongest entries in the franchise, despite some major changes to the formula.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

Junpei,07-07-2013,"Mario Kart: Double Dash is the quintessential Gamecube game for newcomers to the series and for experienced racers as well. It's unique two-racer game play sets it apart from the other games in the franchise, giving the beloved series a new and exciting twist. As if this wasn't enough, this title hosts what are easily the greatest battle mini games in the series. As far as replay ability is concerned, time has taken its toll on this title. With the addition of new Mario Kart games to the franchise and the death of the Nintendo Wii, only the truly dedicated are still playing to this day. That being said, Mario Kart: Double Dash is still one of the greatest party games on the Gamecube, and can definitely be dubbed as a racing classic. In my opinion, the controls work fine until it comes time to turn. If you're not using the L or R buttons, you'd better believe that you're going to fall off of the stage, because the turns are incredibly wide. Even with the L and R buttons, you'll still encounter momentary recoil that takes a second to recover from. In conclusion, anyone with a hankering to play a Gamecube racing classic should consider picking up this game.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
MIDP,10-08-2013,"Amazing entry in the Mario Kart series.

The gimmick in this game is that you are two characters in one car. It works very well.
The characters have their own special items and cars they can use, so that creates a great dynamic.

The tracks in this game are amazing as well.

If you need a GameCube game for multiplayer, this one is a must have.

WCheffirs,08-12-2013,"The best game in the MarioKart franchise in my opinion. Previous examples lacked the precise controllability and graphics while later incarnations became way over the top crowding out the actual racing experience. The track choice in this game is large, the racing is close (thanks to items) and the physics are perfect for an arcade GoKart game. The only drawback with this game which its successors addressed was a multi race championship ladder for multiplayer. Besides that though this is a great multiplayer game that will prove to be an extremely solid and enjoyable game decades on.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
wegie125,03-05-2018,"This game is definitely one that I would recommend, especially if you have family or friends to play with you. This is the only title in the mario kart series to ever have two players on the same kart and while it isn't always the best way to use multiplayer, it definitely added some fun twists. It's hard to replace those feelings you get when you and a friend are neck and neck with another 2 friends on a kart and the person on the back is throwing items while the guy driving tries to get close so that the person on the back can hit the other driver to knock them back. Obviously multiplayer was tried in other ways in the future, but I think it would be cool to bring this back just as a fun mode.",8,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

JJTX,26-05-2019,"Booting up Mario Kart: Double Dash!! today, I'm immediately struck by how good it still looks, especially in progressive scan mode via component cables on an HDTV. Everything is clear and colorful, and the action is fast and frantic. It feels a lot like an arcade game -- and this is by design. MKDD is best enjoyed as an arcade-inspired spin-off to the Mario Kart series; it is fast, frantic, and fun for multi-player, but it is not really a traditional Mario Kart game. My low score is related to my preferred way to play -- solo / campaign -- which is far too random and out-of-control for my liking. The fact I needed to consult the instruction manual when playing for the first time -- after a quarter-century of enjoying other Mario Kart games -- points to a needlessly complicated system and a frustrating amount of content locked behind a ""play-wall"".",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

SavageSalamence,05-09-2014,"I was very exciting when I wanted to get this game. And it did not disappoint. I expected it to be my favorite in the Mario Kart series…and it almost was.
The control takes some time to get used to, that's the only reason I didn't give it a ten. Once you're used to the control however, it's incredibly comfortable and well done.
Some tracks are very fun, sporting huge jumps, exhilarating views, sharp turns very fun to drift on and very unique parts. The music is pretty upbeat in most stages and it fits the stages very well. Especially stages like Mushroom Bridge and Daisy Cruiser.
The graphics don't look too amazing nowadays, but I'm pretty happy with how it looks. It's got nice shading in the right stages and it sports some good colors.
The gameplay is definitely the best out of any Mario Kart game, including two players in one kart adds to your strategy because each character gets their own unique item and you can switch drivers to keep an item in stock. It is possible to shoot straight from last to first, with both assistance from the Chain Chomp and using items which make you work to use them well, but end up being rewarding in the end.
One of my favorite aspects of this game is the Battle Mode. You have your standard Balloon Battle, but you also have Shine Thief which is an excellent four player game and Bob-Omb Blast where the only item is Bob-Ombs which makes it completely skill based. It's fun with any number of players this game.
The one player mode has some replayability, while the multiplayer has very high replayabilty. It's great for tournaments and parties, plus reunions and friend hangouts. I would highly recommend this game, as high as Mario Kart DS.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

UltraGamer50,30-09-2020,"To me a very mediocore title. The graphics look stunning and the Charm is undeniable, but the lack of an incentive to come back to this game despite all the positive reviews, just make put it in the middle of the spectrum for me.

Pros:
1. Good Graphics despite the Gamecubes Hardware.
2. Fun Multiplayer mode
3. Tracks are fun especially Baby Park, a giant oval with 7 whole laps

Negatives:

1. Little replay value
2. Reuse of SFX in certain places
3. Not enough tracks
4. Certainly better games out there

Would i recommend it? No, but that doesnt mean its bad at all, just not my favourite and you can disagree with me, but if so then make your own review.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC
Suken,24-08-2020,"Muy divertido en su totalidad. Modos multijugador que proporcionan una diversión infinita, y un modo de un jugador que siempre supone un desafío. La variedad de personajes está bien, pese a que se echan de menos algunos otros míticos de la franquicia. Las únicas pegas que le pondría sería el trabajo que se hizo con los vehículos, ya que no son muchos, y las opciones de personalización se limitan a los personajes que elijas.

La modalidad de los dos personajes en un mismo Kart lo hace muy bueno, y aunque no supere al 8 por ejemplo, estos detalles pueden ser razón de peso como para preferirlo entre cualquier otro.

BeeSting1,01-01-2021,"The most technical Mario Kart.

Good

- the two racers and two item swapping adds a lot of mechanical skill and reflex test to the gameplay. Makes it more exciting and deeper.

- hitting wall doesn't eliminate all your momentum

- stages are well designed.

Bad

- too much dodging required.

- hard to dodge things because when you turn your cart tends to go straight still

- sometimes your Kart get hits backwards even though the opponent rammed you from the back

- there needs to be a restart option for GP.

- weird how special cup isn't unlocked from beating star cup 150cc, only 100cc

- there are so many items to the point where luck plays a huge factor in winning. This holds back the deep gameplay mechanics the double riders and drifting. They're tied to each other, making it a catch 22.",9,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The powerups carry that Mario charm, the maps are incredible, and the idea of having multiple characters at once and transitioning between them adds for some wonderful strategy.

Firstly, the AI. CPU doesn't play for the victory, they just want to ruin your day. You're third? The second racer will throw a red shell behind, just to hit you. They won't try to hit the first one. Another problem is that some tracks are not well designed for the particular drift system of this game (Wario Stadium, Dino Park). The roster is great, the characters are well matched together.

First, there's tons of new characters, like Diddy, Birdo, Waluigi, King boo.
Second, the special items are fun to use, heart is really a clever idea, Bowser Shells are crazy in tracks like Baby Park, and who can forget the Mega Banana.
There's great tracks in this game, like Mushroom highway, Baby Park, Dk Mountain, and Yoshi Circuit.
Also, the battle modes are easy to have fun with, especially the shine thief.

It still has great tracks, good music, and is still a fun time, but now seems to have gotten dusty. Furthermore, many of the tracks (especially the good ones) are in current Mario Kart titles.

Beastprogamer,30-10-2015,"One of the Best Games on the Nintendo 64 and a sequal to the SNES Super Mario Kart, Mario Kart is here on the N64. I think this game is AMAZING. It has SOOOO many awesome stuff, one of my favourites in the series. The character selection is okay, but I play as either Mario, Yoshi, or occasionally DK. I don't play as Luigi, mainly because I leave that to my younger bro, we still play it, really fun and you should definitely play this. So I don't mind that it only has 8 characters to choose from.

Multiplayer is fun, you can have up to four players and race, or Battle. Battle mode is fine but not the best. The Tracks are great, I love the tracks: DK's Jungle Parkway, Bowser's Castle, Choco Choco Mountain, and Kalimari Desert are some of my favourite tracks, just to name a few. Rainbow Road is awful IMO, because of the chomps, and the course is too long. Thank you Nintendo for reducing the trouble in Mario Kart 8 because it takes around seven to ten minutes just to clear the damn thing! The controls are really good. The graphics are great for the Nintendo 64, Nintendo put a lot of effourt into it. Mario Kart 64 is one of my favourite N64 Games and you should DEFINITELY check it out!

While this title has not aged as well as other Mario Kart games (or even other N64 racing games for that matter), it is still great to pick up and play with your friends, just not by yourself.

Pros:
-Nice fun and traditional Mario Kart gameplay.
-Good tracks and items.
-Good character line up.
-Excellent Multiplayer.
-Good Nostalgia.
-Nice cheerful music.

Cons:
-Time Trials are too sensitive and will not save the ghosts just by getting hit by something simple or even from just pausing!!
-Features felt lacking after a while.
-CPU AI was not generated well and they can even be frustrating on 50cc.

The excitement of unboxing that N64 bundle with this game hasn't been matched to this day! Me, my brother and my father spent hours and hours racing each other and battling on the awesome battle arenas (particularly block fort and double decker). This game is really what started my life-long love affair with Nintendo. The tracks were amazing, the music was just as good and the crazy weapons made this game a hell of a lot of laughs every time we put the cartridge in!

The controls are tight and solid; the visuals are simple and generally crisp, and the weapons in multiplayer are all-time classics (bananas, mushrooms, stars, shells, boos and lightnings).

There is rubber banding by the computer opponents, which is a bit annoying, but it doesn’t ruin the experience.

The single play mode of the 4 cups is okay, however, it lacks sustainable value once all cups have been won.

Where this game falters is the lack of any unlockables, as everything is available from the start. While the amount of content for an N64 game is certainly ample, it takes away a little bit of longevity this game could've had.

Ademas la version de la consola virtual no deja guardar fantasmas. El juego es divertido hasta que terminas las pistas de 50cc. Una vez que las terminas el juego se vuelve aburrido y repetitivo, sumado a que la IA se vuelve frustrante, siempre 2 corredores detrás tuyo alcanzándote todo el tiempo. Y cuando un corredor gana la carrera en un torneo, siempre ganara en las siguientes, dependiendo del personaje que elijas, aunque principalmente ganan Wario y Toad, parece una carrera robotica, no hay aleatoriedad....

Good

- they did an amazing job of bringing Mario carts into 3D. The controls are fluent and responsive. I also liked how they changed up the drifting so that you can get boost, and also the angle is less awkward as super Mario Kart

- stages were varied. Lots of vertical terrain, and different obstacles.

Bad

- hitting someone stationary during spin out will make you spin out even if u are going slow.

- cpu go unfairly fast. They can still keep up with me despite me spamming gold mushroom

- cpu will catch up right behind you near the final part of the final run. Despite them bring far behind

- getting 4 bananas makes your Kart look like it's boosting which is very misleading and has caused me to crash

- it's way too easy to spin out. Turn left and right too many times, you'll spin out. Someone heavy runs into you, or you run into someone heavy, you spin out. On top of the regular item spin outs. It's too much, and basically match ending for you

- CPUs don't utilize items fully. They don't use shells.

- it's a **** feeling when you pull off multiple perfect drifts dodging everything, only to have the cpu magically catch up. Why should I stress on doing perfect drifts when CPUs are going to be toe to toe with me no matter what? I should just drive normally. This in turn makes the grand prix gameplay super boring.",6,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

ntBagel,23-04-2022,"Mario kart 64 a game I have really enjoyed playing as a kid. Replaying it was enjoyable at times but also noticed many problems with the game. Mario kart 64 is of coarse fun to play with friends and family but playing it alone is pretty boring and frustrating. first a look at the graphics in my opinion the title and UI is very bland and just doesn't look very appealing and in game player sprites aren't even in 3D as well as the items. the way the maps are seen makes it very hard to see what is ahead of you. lots of the stages look very outdated graphically. now going into the controls I'm very mixed on it. it feels very ok. stuff like drifting and using items aren't very satisfying or rewarding to use. ex. red shells often hit walls, mushroom feel underwhelming and drifting feels clunky and hard to use. moving on from that character selection is ok as well as the stages nothing really is amazing but nothing that's really bad. overall, this game is very ok to me it doesn't really feel like it aged to well but will always be a blast to pop in to play with some friends. I just don't see a big reason to play it now compared to any of the newer titles. 5/10 (average)",5,MARIO KART 8 deluxe,METACRITIC

The tracks themselves are kind of good, with having ones like Wario Stadium, Toad's Turnpike, Royal Raceway, and DK's jungle parkway.
Of course, the battle mode is amazing. With the best map Block 4 being there, you can play for unlimited time until one gets defeated.
The Bad things about this game is really the controls. The drift is hard to get used to, and if you jump left and right you slip for no reason.
