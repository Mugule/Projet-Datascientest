ShiroAlter,20-11-2021,"Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and it’s sister version Shiny Pearl are a return to form for Pokémon and with a fairly new team (ILCA inc.) at the helm of these remakes it’s a nice revisit to Sinnoh! While lacking in the drastic changes as other remakes in the series these games are faithful recreations to the letter, sometimes going abit too far. With the large and anticipated Pokémon Legends: Arceus looming in the not so distant future these games are a great way for new players to the series to experience the great adventures that were the original Diamond and Pearl, but also a great starting place as well!",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

dfq,21-11-2021,"I‘m having a blast with this game. It might be mostly nostalgia, but that‘s what I wanted (I believe that‘s what people generally want from a remake). They managed to make it feel almost exactly how I remember the games from my childhood. Graphics-wise it may not look as “advanced“ as Pokémon Sword/Shield but if you don‘t mind the chibi-look, which I actually really like, it looks really good. The male player character looks a little bit strange, but that doesn‘t deserve a 0/10 rating in my opinion.

Referring to other user reviews, why ruin a perfectly fun old game by completely changing it? If you don‘t like playing exactly the same game with updated graphics and a few quality-of-life improvements (that are still true to the originals), then you shouldn‘t buy it. I mean, what do these people expect? That‘s what a remake is, right?

This isn‘t a „lazy remake“. I’ve seen mostly superficial criticism in these user reviews which don‘t justify a 0/10 rating. Also, the games being too easy is always a subjective matter. It has some small issues, sure, but which game doesn‘t?

I honestly found Pokémon Sword/Shield to be really bland and disappointing when they had released and found myself having more fun on my Nintendo DS playing my original copy of Pokémon Platinum. Now that I can replay the fourth Pokémon generation on the large screen in Full HD with some annoying things from the Nintendo DS versions of Pokémon Diamond and Pearl removed and some enhancements added, I‘m having a lot of fun again. In my opinion they delivered precisely what a fan of the old games would have wanted. They even added the Underground which is amazing! You can have so much fun playing these games either alone or with your friends.

I absolutely recommend buying and trying out these remakes!",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
MrHtheModder,21-11-2021,im quite enjoying BDSP its HD annd 3D diamond and Pearl with added online features and it also adds great quality of life features like EXP share and the map saying where to go which is super handy because i hated getting lost in the originals because it did not tell me where HMs are or where to go and speaking of HMs they also fixed that too they made it so HMs are no longer tied to your Pokemon i also quite like the new shiny sparkles they are super pretty so overall 10/10 its amazing,10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
NotaGamer7,21-11-2021,"I wonder why so many people who love originals hate on the remaster. If it's basically the same content then the only thing you may not like would be it's graphical representation. Judging it makes no sense as the art style is a flavor. Based on one's perception it can not be junged objectively. What can be judged objectively is the quality of content (in game object oriented content) which in my opinion is stunning in this game.
The fact that people don't understand the difference between remake and a remaster is one thing. What drains me is that serious majority of people struggle with judging a thing they don't like as good (and vice versa). Music in this game stands in its own class. Graphical art style gives this game new identity. Quality of life improvements are present for games good. I don't see what is it that mekes this game worse than its predecessor.

Criticerty,21-11-2021,The game overworld is gorgeous and Chibi art style is much better than the first trailer. The game is so much more easier to play and have so many better features than the original games. The only reason I am rating this 8/10 is because the definitively better version Pokémon Platinum has so many of its features removed that it makes the game content feel so much more smaller than it actually is.,8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
ewertoncoutinho,21-11-2021,"The game is a faithful remake of the original game with small features, but with great elegance in its game play.

Would you replay them again? In a heartbeat

BDSP is, without a shadow of a doubt, a trip down nostalgia lane, a re-imagining of the original journeys throughout the Sinnoh Region from their initial outings in Diamond & Pearl. Story If the goal was to achieve faithful remakes of those games, then ILCA have fully succeeded in their mission. It’s just as leisurely paced as the original Diamond & Pearl, encouraging the player to take their time and take in their surroundings. The story of DP is quite grand but it wasn’t fully realised and developed until Platinum. Lots to do & explore whilst not feeling too linear with a maze-like map. In this instance however, after playing through the game, I personally feel as though the fleshed out story beats from Platinum are missing here.

Graphics
They’re clean, charming & capture the essence of what classic top-down Pokémon used to be. Cutesy & child-like. Sword & Shiled in comparison can look a little muddy around the edges. There were a few janky animations from time-to-time but nothing that didn’t just make me smile and giggle. They clearly take inspiration from the Links Awakening remake, and on reflection, it was probably the better route to go down than trying to re-create these games in Sw/Sh graphics. Don’t be fooled by the initial reveal trailer, the improvements in lighting, shading & character models has come on leaps & bounds since we first saw it at the beginning of the year. Everything Else
-The roster of Pokémon is as it was in Gen 4, it actually makes for a decent challenge trying to shape a team with the Pokémon you have at your disposal. We won’t get all the Pokémon in Legebds Arceus, we didn’t get them all in Sw/Sh, why should this be any different?
-The grand underground is a place where you could spend hours hunting through the walls or capturing Pokémon, otherwise unobtainable in the overworld for your adventure. ILCA, you did a cracking job of the underground and making it useful & accessible for everyone. -Contests have been re-defined & streamlined but IMO I would say this was for the worst. Contests in the original had substance & felt like a journey in of themselves. The new version of contests are a rhythm game - great if you’re short of time, but I didn’t feel as though I had something to work towards. Poffin making can be tedious at times! - The EXP share was a necessary edition although it should have been a toggleable option. I had it on for my whole journey and blacked out a couple of times! It negates the grind, but ideally should’ve been optional. I very much enjoyed my time with BDSP, ILCA have managed to rekindle that inner child and bring back memories of playing my original copy of Diamond back in 2007. Newcomers of the series will have a shock as BDSP is the genuine article when it comes to what Classic Pokémon is all about. A little bit tough, a grand adventure & a lot of fun. Highly recommend first time Pokémon players pick up this one rather than any of the more recent entries. ILCA catered this game to the fans of Diamond & Pearl, a love letter to what Pokémon used to be, trying not to get hung up on the more recent additions & changes in the newer games. I hope TPC continue to outsource some of their projects.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Chaosblazer321,20-11-2021,"I feel that these are welcome additions to the remake category, though they are not without flaws, I definitely feel that compared to the original Diamond and Pearl entries these are superior.

They are much faster than the originals especially when it comes to surfing and trudging through the northern snow routes, which even in platinum was still a slow process to deal with. Gym Leaders are just as challenging, in the cases of some of them even more so, and the E4 and Cynthia are even more extreme, and the grand underground exploration is so great, being able to find pokemon that are not in the original sinnoh dex and being able to use them, between that and the upgraded digging style, you could stay down there for hours and even better you can save down there so you are not forced to leave.

there are some aspects I do wish they had kept from platinum, such as platinum's story, and the distortion world, but removing them are not deal breakers, also despite the EXP share being on constantly, it has not made the game any easier for me, I can understand the fustration of those who wish that they could turn it off, but I feel the game is challenging even with it on.

Overall I find these games solid for games that were outsourced and I feel like the only true way to judge them is to try them yourself, perhaps by renting or borrowing them from a friend before you make the decision yourself as in the end you are the only one who can decide if a game is bad or not, and I personally feel these are good installments even if they aren't perfect.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Lilpain1997,21-11-2021,To those review bombing... Stop you look stupid as this is very clearly not a 0 or even less than a 6 if you like Pokémon in anyway shape or form. To put it short its DP but with added content and QOL improvements. I see a lot of dumb comments here saying its a broken game or FPS is terrible or that the graphics are bad... None of which are true at all. I have 15 hours in Diamond rn and have spotted 1 FPS drop when I played unpatched. If you enjoy Pokémon just buy it as you will enjoy it,8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
neddymack,21-11-2021,"This is exactly what I want from a remake of a Pokémon game. Does it reinvent the series? No, as it shouldn’t have to. The graphics are fine as they are a modernized version of the DS original akin to the Link’s Awakening remake. The gameplay loop is the same as every other mainline Pokémon game and is solid per usual. It brings back that sense of exploration missing from the base Sword and Shield game which I desperately missed. It’s a perfect time sink while waiting for Arceus, the game that should be striving to further the series in terms of reinvention. This game doesn’t deserve the low score many are giving it, it’s at least a 7–8 in my book. Even if nostalgia colored glasses, which are a powerful tool, influence my decision.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

BrachiasB,24-11-2021,"I thought this one may have oras or let's go level of new, but NO, it doesn't even have the bare minimum of freshness. for those saying why you wouldn't like this game if you have played original, that's precisely because you don't have anything new compare to that sensation you had 15 years ago. if you're going to remaster a 15 year old pokemon game in 2021, you better have SOMETHING to make it up in terms of content if new pokemon or region wouldn't be a thing. let's make a comparison: what did oras gave us for its remake? new megas, new legendary forms, additional story, and a new online meta. what did this gave us? none, story barely changed or added, nothing new. not even a new legendary form which I hoped for when I saw the statue of fused form of dialga palkia. oh I'm sorry, remaster and remake is 2 separate thing so comparing this to oras is unfair? I. DON'T. CARE. if you have the audacity to put a remaster on a full price, then you must have a reason for that because all non nintendo remasters are never on a full price. even xenoblade chronicle on switch had good amount of features or update from the original and made the price little more convincing. this though? no dex from unova to galar, no competitive online, no battle frontier with little to no new features.

don't get me started on battle. why is the game trending on giving exp to all party member? even when all trainers have vgc level of ai, moveset, item, natures and even evs, they're nothing if you know how typing works. we had something like this on sun moon, and they were tough because you got bunch of unfamiliar pokemon with completely new gimmick. admittedly the trainers weren't that big of a hassle, but the totem pokemon made up the difficulty even with the current exp share. and just as I said, if the ante up is only coming from a trainer, they're the least amount of trouble you should worry about, and that's the only thing for this game. needless to say, the original dpp and bw were challenging because the exp share wasn't the way it is.

oh and poketch. yeah that one is a real clunky one to use now that there's only 1 screen, dowsing and counter is unusable. then again, who cares about those, right?

if you're going to talk about underground, that's the only thing I can praise about. even with that though, this is practically the bare minimum of content or new feature you should have like the hideaway.

contest, why do I care. I never liked spending time on this during dpp or rse because it doesn't reward you anything (unless if you had feebas but lets be real you never had one at the time). if the prize is like the 3 starters (instead of making them appear on hideaway), then you have some incentive to win it. only some stickers and ribbons though? no, not all of us are collectors and thus this is one of the weaker content to bring up.

I can complain thing or two about graphics and bugs, but honestly that doesn't apply to everyone so I only mentioned the bigger picture that everyone would encounter.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Kratosine,21-11-2021,"Un par de remakes mucho mejores que lo que fueron en su dia Let's Go Pikachu y Eevee.
Aunque hubiera preferido mil veces un Sinnoh recreado bajo el estilo de Galar, este estilo chibi adorable y muy pequeño, en remembranza de los sprites originales, sinceramente no me molesta.
Si bien el juego es mas fácil, no es restrictivo ni te obliga a pasar por el aro, puedes jugarlo de múltiples maneras en busca de mayor dificultad.
La música, los modelos y el enviroment esta muy bien rediseñado, y al jugarlo y al ser tan fiel en todo lo que se propone, produce una gran sensación de nostalgia.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
JungleAtk,21-11-2021,"A very fun game. Faithful to the original while adding a few thing to spruce it up. I feel like it’s a bit more difficult than previous entries have been and I welcome that as I’ve felt more recent entries have literally been 1 hit battles. Thankfully this doesn’t happen nearly as often or at least it hasn’t in my case so far. Only a few times have I 1 hit an opponent and it was mostly due to being a much higher level and having a type advantage. I enjoy the chibi graphical style for the overworld and find that it is reminiscent of the older DS games. I don’t remember anyone having an issue with X and Ys or OR/AS chibi style, why all the hate for it now?

I don’t understand all the negative reviews. Is the lack of platinum game elements disappointing? A bit yes. Is it game breaking? No, at least not for me. Modern More recent Pokémon games are constantly throwing new gimmicks at the series to keep it fresh. Megas, Z-moves, V-max, wild area, regional variants. Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl take the series back to a more simplistic period and I find it quite refreshing amidst the all numerous features and additions that the modern games have jam packed into them. These are classic DS era Pokémon remakes with only a few frills here and there. Sorry if you were expecting this to be some super ultra remaster of the century, it’s just classic Pokémon. Honestly that’s all I wanted and ILCA delivered.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

CanadianNetFlix,21-11-2021,"It's fun, you can catch ANYONE YOU RUN INTO regardless of badges or stuff. You're free. It's a very great remake and if I had limited money, I'd pick this up as the best pokemon on switch.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
YanManXplore,21-11-2021,"This review contains will conatin spoilers be warned: I think this game is good/solid. Sure it's not the Sinnoh Remake that could have been but for what it is it's very passable. It's certainly at the very least the best Pokemon game on the Switch (in my opinion) at the time of writing this. If no one wants to read the entire thing I'll have a TLDR at the bottom:

Some Pro's In my opinion:

- The Sinnoh Region is still full of content Contests, Ball Customization, Hidden Caves and other Areas, etc. For those who don't know there probably are also going to be events regarding Darkrai, Shaymin, and Arceus again and its just like the classic games where you actually have to go to a new area and catch them as opposed to just receiving them from a random NPC in the Pokecenter.

-The ""graphics"" are great in terms of the lighting, the water especially(seriously the water is awesome), and most of the background's in battles, the ""chbi""ness of it is a little more divisive but I find it cute. When the game switches into battle mode the full sized character models also look well rendered.

-The Removal of HM Slaves (don't really need to elaborate)

-The Grand Underground is pretty big I'd even say it's more interesting than even the Wild Area as it's pretty much the same concept and is all pretty much flat land. However there's also the nice mini-game of mining which returns and the environments are cooler . It also adds in some more fire types and you can catch every starter from every region that's Gen 4 and below.

-The Postgame: There's actually some good content. Gym leader rematches with competitive teams/movesets and a they use their Platinum Mons and have IVS. A Lvl. 100 Giratina super boss for his Origin form orb at Ranmas Park, Elite 4 Rematches with competitive teams/movesets and IV's ex. Aaron has a Lvl. 77 Heracross with guts and a flame orb on his 2nd rematch, Ranmas Park, and pretty much the same post game from Diamond and Pearl which honestly is only slightly not as good as Platinum's.

- Following Pokemon(most of the time) It is cool that they have this. But there are times when they're a little annoying. Their walk speed isn't always in sync and because they're an actual object you just run into them and have to push them to get across sometimes. They also get stuck in some areas and have to teleport to you. It's fine for the most part though.

-Miscellaneous: Different Outfits, Waaay Faster than Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, The Music is great and they even have DS Sounds in post game so you can listen to it as a bunch of MIDI's lol.

- Good Intro for kids of this generation. I think Teens/Adults may find it less challenging than the Originals. But and this is just speculation I think the difficulty of this game can be a good challenge for kids. Mars's fight actually scared me a bit and any kid choosing Chimchar better grind to get a Monferno/Power up Punch before that first gym. And let's not forget Cynthia and Her 2 rematches all with stated perfect IV mons, a competitively viable team, and her Garchomp.

Some Cons:

- Removal of furniture/customizability for secret bases. Weird Decision on ILCA's part to not just have secret bases back entirely.

- No On/Off toggle for EXP. All opinions/gameplay may vary but having the EXP. All makes the middle game really easy PROVIDED that you fought 90% of the trainers, explored every single area, and fought like 80% of wild encounters. It is a bit more manageable in early game since there aren't that many trainers/high level pokemon but middle game is kind of easy to clear. I had to try and avoid battling so much in order to be on curve. It is a bit better than previous entries as you're mons will only be slightly higher than the gym leaders. But It can be really abused. (Especially with the Grand Underground)

- Slight Lack of Platinum Content ex; Battle Frontier, Resort villa, platinum story (there is a ""distortion room"" for Ranmas park but not a distortion world) While it sucks that this game is lacking these. I think the content added supplements most of these losses.

- Return of Breakable TM's really weird choice but Is only an issue for those who are attempting competitive. In honesty I believe competitive will probably be staying in Sword and Shield. However I think this game also has a chance for it's own competitive scene. But VGC will most likely stay in SWSH.

- Sound effects sometimes cut in and out(Idk if that's just me) not too big but it made me pause sometimes to think about it.

- I bumped into stuff a bit because the chibi is a lot bigger than what I was expecting It was a little annoying not gonna lie. (This might just be a me problem)

TLDR: I think this game is worth trying. At least if anything try it for the post game, the grand underground, and the chance to replay/start sinnoh with a new coat of paint.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Merfy,21-11-2021,"I grew up playing Pokémon games on the Gameboy like many others, Emerald was the last one I played many years ago so I was excited to see what Gen 4 had to offer. I had been craving a traditional Pokémon experience on the Switch ever since it came out and these remasters are exactly what I was looking for.
The graphics are similar to Link's Awakening in appearance, music is top notch just like in Emerald and the game runs at 30fps. One major flaw with the game is that it is far too easy, most of the time I just breeze through battles one shotting everything in sight. Great game but a hard mode or some difficulty settings would have been a nice addition for those looking for a proper challenge.

Overall I highly recommend this game to people who are new to Diamond/Pearl, I am not sure how it compares to the originals so this review is for players who have never played them before.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Graphics are chibi style and if that is something that bothers you too much you are already decided anyway ... they are okay in person, it's no Link's Awakening but it has its moments and chibi villains are just cutely funny in a good way. Difficulty seems to be better than your standard Pokemon game though it does seem to be messing a some of the stuff that made Sword and Shield really good.

FriendlyDM2,22-11-2021,"I’ve enjoyed this game a lot!

Seeing Pokémon Diamond and Pearl in 3D like this was a lot of fun. At first, I didn’t enjoy the overworld style in the trailers all that much, but that feeling quickly faded away as I played the game. Small adjustments which have been made to the game to make some quality of life changes have been very welcome! The battle system is snappy and doesn’t waste any of your time!

The Grand Underground is a lot of fun, has been made a bit more simple in comparison to the originals on the Nintendo DS and have been expanded at the same time, now including wild Pokémon to catch and train against!

The inclusion of the Experience Share for every one of your party members shaves off a lot of time previously spent sending out your weakest Pokémon, switching to a stronger one and then finishing the battle, or being able to only train one Pokémon at a time with a single Experience Share Hold Item, which makes it a LOT easier to help evolve Pokémon for completing your Pokédex!

All in all, I’ve been having a lot of fun with this game, though I personally see this as more of a €40,00 title, rather than a full-price one. I would have wanted to see even MORE from this remake than what we got. I can recommend this game for sure though!",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

CMGPUR,22-11-2021,"A 6.1? Seriously? I'm starting to think that there is a growing trend in this site to review-bomb anything that comes out without any valid reasoning. I get the new Battlefield and COD because both DICE and Activision clearly have proven again that they don't care about the consumers so long as people keep buying their lackluster games. You can see the irony on B2042 being one of Steam's worst reviewed games ever and still being in the top 10 games being played. I can also see mixed or bad reviews of mediocre remasters like the GTA trilogy but this remake is in my opinion, one textbook example of how to make a fantastic and faithful adaptation of a beloved classic. The game's characters are Chibi, something that really doesn't detract at all because it feels like a throwback to the classic top-down games that preceded it. The graphics look great and the performance is spot on. The game retains absolutely everything in terms of the story, the places, the characters, the music and expands on the post game content heavily. It features a massive underground map so that you can catch many older generation Pokémon and while it can be grindy at times in terms of catching specific legendaries, its still very addicting. The game wasn't hard at all though but it more than made for it on the Pokémon League. Sinnoh still has the hardest league and final champion of every mainline game so my Pokémon really had to sweat to win it. The game is honestly perfect and that's because they gave this remake project to ILCA, a company that actually cares and respect the originals. Game Freak has lost its touch heavily and cannot make good Pokémon games anymore. They should just stick to printing money like Rockstar, Activision, and EA.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

HerrWinstein,20-11-2021,"These remakes do the bare minimum and charge $60 for it. Before you buy this game, know what you're getting into:

- Poor presentation. It has a poor chibi art style, horribly converted music, and ill-fitting font.

- TMs are single-use again. The game adds in multiple QoL features, yet takes away the most QoL-friendly feature over the past decade. Some trainers give multiple TMs, but prepare for a slog if you want to get more in the post-game.

- Like Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, it omits additions from Platinum, such as the superior trainer rosters, a fleshed-out Distortion World, and Battle Frontier. It doesn't even include the back button for the Poketch.

- No extra regions (like FireRed/LeafGreen's Sevii Islands) or new post-game story (like Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).

- Removes or simplifies certain features, like Super Contests or the Underground Secret Bases

- The games have a barely functional online multiplayer system at launch and don't have the ability to transfer older Pokemon at launch.

- Like Ultra Sun/Ultra Moon, catching older legendaries in the post-game is a tedious, luck-based process involving the Grand Underground.

- The games barely improve on the maligned Honey Tree mechanic, and the post-game grind for competitive items and TMs is still a slog.

- Like Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee, it lacks a proper random online battling system, so be prepared to face random teams full of Dialga and Palkia.

- Only includes the first 493 Pokemon (similar to how Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee only included 153 Pokemon).

- Inconsistent addition of newer features; it adds in moves and consumable items from later generations, yet removes most of the recent held items (like Assault Vest).

- First Pokemon games since Crystal (2000/2001) not to include new Pokemon species, forms, or moves.

- The Platinum outfits are locked to early-order bonuses instead of being available normally.

(I won't mention the mandatory Exp. Share, since all of the Pokemon games are easy. I will say that the series is long overdue for multiple difficulty levels, though.)

if you can look past that long list of negatives, there is some fun to be had. Walking Pokemon and trainer customizations are welcome additions from other games, and the post-game rematches have well-designed teams. Being able to catch a variety of Pokemon in the Grand Underground and participate in Super Contests online are also solid additions. Finally, the base games still hold up, even with all of the questionable changes.

Overall, there's a reason these are the lowest rated paired Pokemon games to date. Decades of laziness has finally taken its toll on the franchise.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Turndown4hwut,20-11-2021,"This game, and it's sister game Shining Pearl, are some of the most superfluous games I have ever played. I mean, yeah, if you play a remake of a game you already own, it will feel pointless, but while Diamond and Pearl were obviously made in 2006, they were great for the DS, while the remakes still feel like they're stuck in 2006. Even just considering Pokémon remakes, those still had a reason for you to pick them up.
FireRed and LeafGreen had the Sevii Islands, so you could get Johto Pokémon in Generation 3, without having to get a Gamecube, Colosseum, or eventually XD.
HeartGold and SoulSilver added so much content they could basically be considered new games. The Safari Zone, new routes in Johto, and Kanto dungeons that were cut from the original Gold & Silver came back, better than ever before.
Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, as much as they ignored the good stuff added in Emerald, *cough* Battle Frontier *cough*, Mega Evolutions were still there, in fact, they actually introduced more of them, plus two Primal Reversions for Groudon and Kyogre. And also, incredibly minor, mind you but it's still worth mentioning, Mauville City was changed, for the worse, but there was still more stuff to do than in the original GBA games.
Even Let's Go! Pikachu and Let's Go! Eevee allowed you to get Meltan and Melmetal in Pokémon GO, at least until you could get them just by transferring stuff into Pokémon HOME.
Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl on the other hand, offer nothing to convince you to play them over the original Diamond and Pearl if you own them, and if you own Platinum, then apart from the Platinum Outfit available to early adopters, Rotom Forms and Origin Forme Giratina, there is no Platinum Content. No Battle Frontier (again), no Charon, No villa, and no Distortion World.
On top of that, there's the forced Gen 6 EXP Share, which basically means if you want some sort of challenge, you need to catch 5 random EXP sponges so your starter doesn't get too overleveled, forced Amie bonuses, which basically add up to Pokemon curing themselves of statuses, boosted Critical Hit chances, and for the Pokemon to survive an attack that would otherwise faint it. At least with the Amie bonuses, you can reduce friendship with herbs, but I want my Pokemon to be friendly with me, without basically getting cheats. Also there are no regional forms and cross generational evolutions, meaning you can't use Sylveon or Sirfetch'd. Even Let's Go at least had the regional forms.
TL;DR: If you own Diamond, Pearl, or Platinum, do yourself a favor and not only avoid these games, but to hold onto them for dear life. Especially if it's Platinum. If you don't own them, or you decide to buy them anyway, then you'll be in for a horribly easy time, unless you intentionally do some things to make the game a bit more bearable.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Sinco,20-11-2021,"I have played every main-series Pokemon game since Red and Blue. These are by far the worst. I have never left an online review for anything, but this game made me break that streak. I read the critic reviews before buying it and they were all clear that this is just a copy-paste of the original Diamond and Pearl. That definitely turned me off, but I had some old gift cards lying around so I still bought it. I have no problem giving games a fair shot despite low expectations, literally last week I reluctantly bought SMT5 despite SMT4 having a busted battle system (Tetrakarn/Makarakarn), and it actually turned out to be pretty shockingly well-balanced. Diamond and Pearl were never my absolute favorites but I played them a lot when they came out and liked them fine. I haven't replayed them in probably ten years so I thought it'd still be fun to do so. I was incredibly wrong.

If I had to summarize the game in one word, it is ""boring."" There is just nothing to do, nowhere interesting to explore, and absolutely no challenge. I did a no-item Nuzlocke which is how I prefer to play Pokemon now and it is much, much easier than every other Pokemon game I've played (until you get to the Elite 4). The game is completely unbalanced for a mandatory party-wide EXP share. Even if you don't play for a challenge, there is a complete lack of variety in Pokemon you are fighting that makes even a quick playthrough feel tedious and obligatory. There is just nothing fun, exciting, or interesting about this game, so what reason is there to play it? These games were fun 15 years ago because they were new! New region, new Pokemon: a pretty good formula for something fun. In 2021, the Pokemon are not new, the region is not new, and there is a complete lack of new content (except the skippable underground), and so it turned out that I had no real reason to keep going except pure completionism.
(Notice that I haven't mentioned how they look. That's because I think they look fine! I have no problem with the art style or graphical quality.)

I have never even remotely disliked a Pokemon game before. I even thought Let's Go was pretty fun. However, releasing essentially a carbon copy of a 15 year old game for double the original price with no effort or care towards making it fun or interesting for modern players feels like a pretty big slap in the face. ORAS felt like whole new games and are probably my favorite Pokemon games, and I was never an especially big fan of the originals. Going from those to whatever this is is a huge disappointment.

katieelizabeth,20-11-2021,"Pokemon BDSP are not bad games, but overall I'd say this is a pretty unambitious and mediocre remake of an average game for its time that is frankly too faithful for its own good.

In terms of graphics, the game looks completely outdated. The chibi art style is not endearing, nor does it look very good. Fortunately, the character models and pokemon look much better in battle, but all this does is make me wish they were used throughout the entire game. The in-battle models frankly look so much better than the chibi stuff.

The environments look bland and look worse than the original pixel graphics from 2006. I wish they didn't maintain the 2D tile aesthetic - it just looks fake/outdated to me. How do several indie games manage to look better than a game produced by a 105 billion dollar company?

While the soundtrack is an improvement over the original version on the DS, it still falls way short of the live orchestrated soundtrack from Sword and Shield. Unfortunately, it sounds like this soundtrack is entirely midi-based, lacking any real recorded instruments of any kind.

The story isn't all that interesting either. The original script came out around the same time as Mass Effect. The script wasn't good for its time, let alone holding up in 2021. It is a missed opportunity that the developers didn't modernize/reimagine the script to become more engaging and in line with modern RPGs or the very best of its anime. I wish the gym leaders were more fleshed out and part of the story. I wish team Galactic was given a lot more depth.

The pacing of BDSP is incredibly slow, and the game finds ways to waste your time repeatedly. Random battles are extremely outdated and are annoying, especially in caves. I am so disappointed the game did not choose to have pokemon in the overworld like the modern games.

Eggs take forever to hatch in BDSP and do not benefit from the increased hatching time found in Sword and Shield. I spent over 9000 steps to hatch the egg given to me in Hearthome City and it just wouldn't hatch for me. I got better things to do than rotate my L-stick riding a bike until it hatches. This is such an outdated game mechanic that did not need to be implemented ""faithfully"" in BDSP.

Battles are also super slow to the point of them becoming grating. Essentially, Pokemon battles aren't ""show don't tell"" - BDSP verbosely tells yous everything in nauseating detail. When I faint a pokemon, it should fall immediately when I hit it - it should be obvious to anyone what has happened to that Pokemon by just looking at the animation and the health bar going to 0. Instead, the game's faint animation happens many seconds after the hit, and BDSP still insists on telling you the pokemon fainted with an additional textbox too. Even FF7 did this properly on the Playstation 1! Why is everything so verbose with text dialog boxes for?

Before each combat round, BDSP also shows a textbox saying, ""Your pokemon is awaiting directions."" No kidding! Does anyone seriously need this textbox??? Stuff like ""It's Raining"" is also equally redundant - we can see it raining on the screen! And when using a move, there's no reason its name can't be displayed at the same time as the animation too. The amount of verbose and completely unnecessary text in this game is beyond ridiculous.

And when a battle starts, can we finally have an option to remove the Pokeball fanfare and just have all pokemon come out immediately to save time? Why does starting every random battle have to be padded with 10 seconds of animations? Can the Switch not load these battles faster?

Then there are weird control issues in BDSP, such as the L and R buttons not working in the menus like every other modern game, which tripped me up quite a bit. The d-pad is also unfortunately assigned to walking when it should have been assigned to your 4 registered items. Why did none of the QA staff say anything?

Ultimately, BDSP needed to completely reimagine modern Sinnoh in full 3D (similar to Sword and Shield), modernize and polish the script, and increase the quality of life and production values across the board to justify its AAA price tag. Barring that, BDSP needed to be sold for $29.99 given what we got. Essentially, BDSP is a low-budget cash grab and it should not be praised or endorsed in any way. Pokemon fans need to be vocal and reject these cash grabs. Pokemon fans need to demand better for their hard-earned money because BDSP is an embarrassment for a full AAA-priced game, and is simply not competitive with other AAA games on the market.

If you want to go back to the past - for all its problems - then you might enjoy BDSP. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this game. BDSP's archaic and overly-verbose design just doesn't interest me anymore. I would have much rather had a modern reimagining of modern Sinnoh with immersive 3D environments, a modern engaging story, and high production values. Modern Sinnoh deserved better.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Williamey,21-11-2021,"The art style looks awful, going chibi was a bad choice.
The biggest problem with the art style is that the Pokemon isn't chibi, so they look very out of place when they follow you around or exist in the overworld. Not only do they look incredible out of place, but they are also scaled down to the size of the Player, causing a Gyarados to look like a tiny blue worm.
The animations have no improvements, and they didn't even bother adding a jumping animation to the Pokemon, so they just go back into their Pokéball every time you jump off a ledge etc.
The XP share can't be turned off, so your pokemon are always way too overpowered, completely removing any challenge that you might have had.

SplitMind,26-11-2021,"Brilliant Diamond teeters the line between yet another lazy remaster and a breath of fresh air. For me, I find that the remaster does improve the game quite a bit but is still undermined by decades old mechanics and lacking in innovation.

The graphics are the most noticeable difference here. They may even be divisive as the heads of the characters are absurdly enlarged compared to their bodies. This was jarring at first for me but I got used to it. What made me sceptical was the similarities to the models in Miitopia. Anyway, it is quite nice seeing the game on a TV screen, but where the graphics do quite suffer is in the simplicity of the designs as some pokemon such as Scyther are mostly one block of colour. Having said that, the vivid colours in some areas do stand out and the game is still immediately recognisable as Pokemon.

The gameplay is where Pokemon struggles/refuses to innovate. The core mechanics we all know and love are here, although many grow tired of them by now, myself included. They tried with Sun and Moon to shake up the formula a bit, with S+S attempting and failing at the open-world approach. BD reverts back to the tried-and-tested linear approach, for better or worse.

What stands out to me are the gym battles and Elite 4, in that these were often quite a difficulty spike. I remember this always being the case with Pokemon but it's a flaw of the game to find you have been raising the 'wrong' Pokemon for the Elite 4 and a real faff to raise the one you need at the last hurdle. Having said that, I give kudos because the gym leaders and Elite 4 go outside the box from the usual rock-paper-scissors elemental approach Pokemon has always taken.

The Underground is a new addition, and a peculiar one at that. The digging for treasure aspect resembles lootboxes too much for my liking, while the overall tunnels were a bit vacant and the rooms where you meet Pokemon I always found to contain the same handfuls I've already encountered.

The game does seem to have some end-game content, however after 20+ hours and beating the Champion I had had enough and switched off at this point, but hardcore fans could spend dozens of hours here.

The story of BD is probably Pokemon at its weakest and most formulaic. Obviously a remaster isn't a remake, but it really does show the aging concepts as the same story format is woven throughout the entire series. You won't be surprised by what you find here.

It may be that Pokemon is in a strange epoch. I grew up with it and the simplicity was appropriate as a child, but now I'm older it feels like the games have aged too but not developed. Perhaps Pokemon is caught in a bind between appealing to children vs long-time followers like me, so I can appreciate that but perhaps a simple solution is to release two very different games instead of almost identical ones. This is an amazing con and I don't understand how Nintendo still get away with it, so I deduct points for that always.

Overall, this is merely yet another Pokemon experience. It's nice to dive into for nostalgia but really they could have remade the first three generations instead as they are far more memorable for me. This game does show potential for when the effort is actually put it and makes me curious if Arceus will try stepping outside the box a bit. I'd recommend waiting for that rather than buying this.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

No they aren't the worst games ever but they are unfinished. After FRLG, HGSS, and ORAS, the playerbase expected more content and can you blame them for that? Other than nostalgia what exactly makes these remakes anything more/less than average?

The problem is The Pokemon Company no longer prioritizes the games. Being a multimedia franchise that earns the most profit from merchandise, the games are now pumped out every three years to match up with the anime. They're now side dishes to the main course rather than the other way around.
Add in juggling so much work they decide upon outsourcing one of the most popular generations to a company that's only used to assisting game development, and this is what happens. I don't think devs are lazy. They're all working hard and clearly trying the best they can to salvage this. It's the higher ups who are to blame for the series decline in quality.

If these games did not have ""Pokemon"" attached to them they most certainly would not be reviewed this high when other monster collecting games have surpassed the minuscule amount of content, and been scored lower.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Tubey,24-11-2021,"Unlike most, I don't have a problem with the chibi art style, nor do I find it particularly strange when it swaps over during battle animations to more 'normal' anime sprites. This is fairly standard fare in Japanese animation, even in gaming (Link's Awakening, Animal Crossing etc. etc.) and I think the game looks pretty good overall.

As a faithful remaster (which it is, rather than a remake in many ways), Brilliant Diamond is largely fine. Takes basically no risks, it's just the original with a coat of paint on. However, there are several glaring problems with it.

First is the decision not to use Pokémon Platinum as the basis for this remaster - this was done for greed so they could release two versions in Diamond/Pearl instead of one, but Platinum is a series highpoint; arguably it's their greatest ever title, so to see it ignored is irritating.

From a series veteran perspective, the second major drawback is just how much a fairly simple game in the first instance has been mechanically dumbed down. Specifically, the Experience Share system. This means every Pokémon in your party gains experience from every battle, even if they're not used. Which as an ease of use feature for younger players or those new to the series it would be fine... but it can't be turned off. At all. So if you play this 'normally', you'll be incredibly overlevelled, and you can wave goodbye to things like EV training with more than one Pokémon in your party.

So it's just too easy throughout, and that kills the title for me. It's not a terrible game, but nor is it a masterpiece - in fact, it's bang average, hence the score. I hope Arceus is better than it, or at least more ambitious... and has a toggle switch for any Exp Share!",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

In 2021, these games are worth about $20. In the past, when Pokémon remade prior generations, they took that classic game and then they brought it into the current generation of Pokémon. New moves, new Pokémon, and new mechanics were put into them to make them fun, creative, and more thrilling. Take that idea and scrap it! BDSP has done nothing but take old DS graphics and up the resolution. That is it. There isn’t even inclusion of Platinum into this game, which is inexcusable, especially for that price tag. The UI menus look like they were made for a gameboy. The graphics look like gameboy graphics, and the online play looks like trash. I wouldn’t mind it if it were a $20 game but for a full retail title, it’s unsatisfactory. This is why you don’t take a beloved franchise and offload it to a developer that only makes mobile games, and then rush it. These cartridges shipped with nothing on them but a skeleton. 80% of the game/content were added day one. It’s a shame because Sinnoh is one of the Pokémon locations with a lot of variation in terrain and sights. This could’ve been the most open world and beautiful of Pokémon games, but it was lazily rushed and ultimately ended up like a flat, cardboard, lifeless diarama.

uhohreviewalert,28-11-2021,"i love the fourth generation of pokemon. since i started with sapphire, diamond and pearl were the first new generation i was able to experience. despite the negativity within the community regarding brilliant diamond and shining pearl, i was still excited. i generally don’t care about graphics, but i thought it looked okay enough, and i would pay $100 dollars for diamond and pearl to be relevant again..

..but not like this.

on some level (a really high one because always on exp share is back), i appreciate that ILCA changed basically nothing about the games. i can’t stand the terrible pokemon story and dialogue game freak always wants to shoehorn into the games, and the only thing that really bugs me about the originals (besides wasting a move slot on defog) is the slow performance, and they certainly are more optimized on switch. i’m not really sure if that’s a compliment or more like “well duh,” but beyond that not much is different. maybe even too much.

for starters, the poketch is back and, while a little clunky to use, works well for the most part. however, it’s back down to one button for switching through apps. platinum added a back button so you didn’t have to flip through, like, thirty freaking apps just to get back to the one you accidentally skipped over. how could those drooling mobile developers nobody’s ever heard of not include such a simple and useful feature?

the games struggle to decide between a grid based and full 360* control scheme, and they suffer a little for it. never before have i described a mainline pokemon game with the phrase “this controls bad,” but here we are. it really isn’t a big problem, but it may irk you from time to time, especially when using the bicycle.

a few more quick positives! the updated soundtrack sounds quite nice. nothing is really re-imagined akin to what heartgold and soulsilver did for their base games, but diamond and pearl had great music to begin with and they’re done justice here. with Masuda in charge of the score, though, that isn’t really a surprise. the only track that’s seemingly missing is the wifi connection theme which, to me, is just tragic. also, the underground is pretty okay. it gets kinda old kinda fast, but it does allow you to capture pokemon outside of the sinnoh dex before you finish the game. now you can actually choose between more than, like, three fire types.

a few quality of life improvements really help mitigate some old annoyances. HMs are, in modern pokemon fashion, no longer a problem. you can open the map and choose where to fly, talk to rocks and trees to remove them from your reality, and even defog need only be selected in the poketch. you can access your PC box from the menu, ball capsules and mystery gift are also both in the start menu, and battle screens display type effectiveness to assist new players. i realize these improvements are subjective, but they do help the games feel a bit more modern, i suppose.

now for the big one. i can deal with all the other minor gripes, but the difficulty has been absolutely tanked. it’s that god. damn. exp share.

game freak, and now ILCA, are hellbent on making you play the game the way they think is right. you can never disable it, so every pokemon in your party gains exp from every battle (unless they’re fainted). while this does mean you can switch up your party frequently without worrying about wasting too much exp, once you have your final team they will be overleveled so quickly you just press A to win for the rest of the game. and that’s the biggest shame, because the originals could be one of the tougher games in the series, even if you used strong pokemon.

ultimately, the difficulty is where this game fails. this isn’t diamond and pearl anymore simply because you **** Cynthia without even looking at the screen. play platinum instead.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

speepo,24-11-2021,"I'm just going to be up front here when I say this; this game does nothing new. There is almost zero attempt at actually being better than the originals. Hell, even some content from Platinum is cut entirely when it would've benefitted the game heavily. The game is an absolute breeze to go through, even when up against endgame foes. This is because of two reasons:
A) The EXP Share is constantly on, thus meaning with just one party you can easily level your Pokemon to the point where they could defeat any opponent.
B) If you have save data from Sword and Shield, you can get a Jirachi (an actual Mythical Pokemon) around the first few towns. The same applies for Mew.
Meanwhile, the games keep negative features from the originals. Cyrus isn't even referred to by his real name, he's called ""Boss"" like in Diamond and Pearl. TMs are back to being temporary and one-use, a feature which everyone despised.
The one positive change I can note is the decision to do something similar to Sun and Moon where HMs are restricted to Pokemon that you don't need to waste HMs on.

To take the same game with no new mechanics, and simply reskin it. In this case faithfull remake means lazy one. So what do you get for 60$? Questionable graphics and the same old game from year 2006. That's all, really. I would rather play platinum version, or diamond pearl.

notnoxi,01-12-2021,"tl:dr Pokemon BD failed to give you a reason to play their remake instead of going back to your Nintendo DS. Every remake achieved this, but this time they failed to validate it. You aren't missing much.

Excited at it's first reveal, I was optimistic about the team behind it and how they were taking it. However as the months went by, reality comes knocking my door. Outside Legends of Arceus, this will be the only time you will get to explore sinnoh again for a long time. Besides the questionable gameplay changes and other issues, the remake does the acceptable job of releasing Sinnoh to the Switch. But it's underwhelming for one of the longest and anticipated remakes, in comparison to how Pokemon Company handled their previous remakes. Traditionally, a pokemon remake is done with current technology in mind of it's recreation to show how hardware progressed and what it would've looked like if it were made at that time instead. You saw this with HeartGold / SoulSilver and FireRed/LeafGreen. BDSP misses that mark by not taking advantage of it's hardware and did not add much new additions to this remake. The soundtrack wasn't done much justice, did not take full advantage of Platinum improvements, and the legendary park is cool to a degree till you realize you could already do this in many of their previous games. Platinum DLC is off the table too as you can unlock the alt form in the game, it's also hard to call this a faithful remake when there's things they've forgotten, failed to capture the same atmosphere or color palette, or just changed something for no good reason.

BD/SP works to introduce new players to the region of Sinnoh, but to people who played it when they were younger, they will be underwhelmed. Is it a terrible pokemon game? No, but it failed to meet expectations and it's not like they didn't know as they've been aware of how much people wanted this for a long time.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

MasdeuVL,01-12-2021,"I had been waiting for over 10 years for a 4th gen remake. I always told to myself ''when 4th gen remakes release, i will buy them, no doubt.''. You can't imagine the disappointment i felt when i first saw the trailer of these 2 new games, it was like wanting something so badly and getting it taken out from you when you could almost touch it. I obviously got the games, but that only made my disappointment even worse. I honestly expected a true remake, one in which they use all the new technology used on the most recent pokemon games (in this case Let's go P/E or Sw/Sh) to make an ''old'' game feel like a new ''actual'' experience and a true ''revisit'' of the region the games are settled in, like taking a new and modern perspective of those games.
Sadly that didn't happen this time around, i just wanted to point out the lack of innovation in this games. It is sad that at this point I think that it is better to play platinum than this games, because it has way more content (we are talking about a 10+ year old game) since there is literally more diferences between platinum and the original diamond and pearl than BD/SP and the original diamond and pearl.

Just by following the most direct route to the next gym, you will massively out-level the gym by the time you get there. I think the new exp share system is part of the problem as it completely trivializes training your team. No longer do you need to try and use pokemon that are type-weak against certain opponents to train them, you can complete the entire game with one strong pokemon and your whole team will just passively level.

Teddy-Kun,24-11-2021,"Don't waste your money on this. I was never a fan of Pokémon going 3D, but I told myself the 3DS was holding it back. So how do these games look worse than Sun/Moon? The chibi artstyle on the overworld might be faithful to the originals, but it doesn't look that good. The entire game has no character, compared to the DS originals which, while being limited to being almost entirely 2D, where extremely charming. Compared to other 3D Pokémon games, the problem is probably best summed up as, the colors just don't pop. The games look very flat, compared to even the 3DS games. The games are laughably easy. They included every new thing that made the last games easier (EXP share for the entire team always on, Pokemon critting more often and surviving hits that should have KOed them if the friendship is high enough) and then decreased levels compared to the originals? The only exception is Cynthia which ramps the difficulty up to 11 with a competitive team. The story is a carbon copy of the originals with no notable changes. Post-game is non-existent and every change Platinum made is also cut completely. What did they improve? The new underground is a very nice addition, as well as the removal of HM's. Don't get me wrong you will have fun playing these games, but only because the originals where good games and you know what Platinum was better in every way. It feels like Gamefreak doesn't know what we like about Pokémon or what the fans want. They copy pasted the originals, made them 3D, made them easier and called it a day. They couldn't even be asked to include any Pokémon that weren't in the originals, even though the 3D aspect should make that an almost trivial task, by just doing what they did for the entire game, CTRL+C -> CTRL+V. No new features like Mega-Evolution, Z-Moves or even Dynamax are here. Additionally the games are already so bugged, that glitches similar to the original DS games where discovered. While these generally don't happen during a normal playthrough, they show a lack of polish. TLDR play a patched version of Platinum that removes some of the kinks or even just the vanilla version and you will have a better experience. If we call out EA for copy pasting the same game every year I. The Fifa series, Gamefreak shouldn't get any other treatment for doing the same, even if the games are 15 years old at this point.",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC

1. Content: The game locks content present in the original game behind a paywall in form of the GWS that you have to use GameFreak's subscription service Pokémon Home for(+Nintendo Switch Online for a total of $40/year).

2. Far too slow: A Trainer's or wild Pokémon's introduction before battle takes about ten seconds. Every textbox in battle stops you for a whole second before you can proceed and literally every little change gets a textbox, some even get repeated (like when you use rain dance, or confuse an opponent).
This, coupled with a way too low difficulty curve made me dread running into opponents.

3. Difficulty: The game is so easy that I was always two levels ahead of trainers I used to be two levels under in the original, because you can't turn off the EXP-Share. I often started mashing A and looking on my phone, also because the game's so slow.

JCgamer18,05-12-2021,"This is a very faithful remake. honestly a little too faithful. a lot of its shortcomings are removed in exp share being always on to the underground. Its still a great game and honestly its not changed that much from the og DP. The underground where non dex pokemon hide and no more hms make this game so much more enjoyable this time around and the improved exp restructure removes a ton of the grind. The music is top notch as always.

That being said my biggest problem is that its too faithful in a bad way. instead of using platinums fixed routing and readjustments it sticks to DPs version. a good instance of this is when you get your starter. in platinum they give it to you very fast rather than going through a custcene. the other big problem i had was single use TMs which they give you TMs so easy that it makes removing this feature pointless.

It is clear that ILCA put time and effort into this game, and it's impressive as it's their first big game project as they've only helped with games on the side. The music is extremely good.

Poochingus,26-11-2021,"Overall this was less than it should have been. Every remake up to this point has at least added something new and interesting. This one does not, and leaves out a fair amount of content too for some reason. While Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire were heavily criticized for leaving out battle frontier, it at least added tons of amazing new things, including a brand new post game story line. These games left out way too much. The art direction is also a massive letdown and looks worse than every 3DS title. It is very jarring going from this soft and sterile overworld to the fully realized art style in actual battles.

What they did well was speeding things up, faster movement, health bars drain faster etc. The underground having a little bit of new content was nice, but its nothing that big.

There is a lot I could say, but overall, I would suggest to anyone not interested in competitive pokemon skip this title, and even then it is a hard sell at $60 for a game with a value of $40 that doesn't live up to its own heritage.

Overall, it will sell amazingly, so it doesn't matter, but just save your money and if you want competitive, find some other outlet. If you want a good pokemon game, look to titles from the 3DS and earlier. a 3DS is at the time of writing quite affordable still, and the 3DS games are still mostly not overpriced, so get it while you can.

I wish these remakes had soul, but they simply do not. If we ever get a real pokemon game again I will be surprised, but for now, just play if you want to. Its just not something I think has good appeal or value. Maybe if they add in some real QoL that other Jrpgs have had for a decade at this point, and push for more content and restoring the ability to catch and own all the pokemon again, then we can start to talk about a 5/10 game at least.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

PewPewMcP,01-12-2021,"Remakes are supposed to take the best gameplay elements of the old games while brushing up on gameplay mechanics that didn't age well to deliver a fulfilling, up-to-date experience. However, Gamefreak once again demonstrates their utter inability to design decent videogames by selecting the least liked mechanics from old and new Pokemon games, stitching them together in to a misshaped chimeric mess and bold-facedly masquerading it as a ""faithful remake"". Concepts such as 8 directional run are carelessly implemented to create a glitchy, softlock prone game that really makes you feel like you're playing Gen 1 again, while the chibi style is horribly leveraged to create some of the ugliest cutscenes in the series. TMs somehow are one-use again, while the unpopular mandatory EXP share makes a comeback, illustrating Gamefreak's tone deafness and general inability to sift good mechanics from bad ones. The long-requested feature of Pokemon following you makes a return, but the Pokemon scale awkwardly, follow you clumsily (often ending up just warping to your position due to their slow follow speed) and mesh poorly with the aforementioned ugly chibi character sprites. Affection and friendliness are now collapsed into one mechanic in a classic hallmark of Gamefreak laziness, and much like the EXP share, reduce your options to control how you play the game. The Poketch has been forced in without any consideration for how well it works in docked mode. And of course, your national dex is still stuck in a reduced capacity while battle animations remain as lazy and uninspiring as ever.

If you are a child or parent of a child, this of course doesn't matter to you, you're still playing Pokemon because it's designed for kids. But if you consider yourself someone who enjoys well-implemented game mechanics, I advise you to turn away from this title. Gamefreak demonstrates yet again it has no idea what good game mechanics are and are instead throwing everything at the wall, not even caring whether anything sticks because they are in charge of the biggest videogame franchise in the world and they know it'll sell well no matter how little effort they actually put into it.

Aiodensghost,28-11-2021,"Wanted Shin Megami Tensei V but was SOL, so I picked this game up instead since my sister also wanted to play it and we could share the game.

The art work is HORRENDOUS. Whoever thought chibi characters where a good idea should've been fired. The game holds your hand WAY to much, and each enemy attack is pretty much predictable to the point you use maybe 1 or 2 moves per Pokemon. Hitting enemy weaknesses isn't as rewarding/satisfying as they are in Shin Megami Tensei because while they do slightly more damage they only do that, slightly more damage.

You can, quite literally, complete this game with just your starter. Pitiful.

The online portion of the game is absolute garbage. In the middle of an online battle? Well now your not because in 2099 you could have terabit internet and the game would still drop your connection to your opponent like a freaking hot potato.

Pokemon está muerto, y Gamefreak no lo va a resucitar. Hay dos opciones: O Gamefreak, por dignidad, asume su incomptencia y deja la franquicia en manos de buenos diseñadores, o simplemente asuman los seguidores de estos juegos que Sol y Luna fueron los últimos juegos de Pokémon en los que, aunque fuesen mediocres, aún había una pizca de ambición (atrozmente llevada a cabo). Lo que quiero decir es que, aunque Sol y Luna, X e Y u ORAS no merezcan el tiempo de los jugadores y jugadoras, al menos había aún un mínimo esfuerzo por crear algo nuevo con esos juegos, que repetía la fórmula, sí, pero con matices. Ahora ya no quedan matices, la peña se come el mismo juego desde X e Y una y otra vez, pero cada una de las veces más mediocre que la anterior, con menos razón de ser.

And so that's exactly what they did. They pawned it off to a literal mobile game dev team and made a mobile game - and it's selling like hotcakes. They took a massive dump on the desire and hype for these remakes.
There's nothing I can say in this review that hasn't already been said. Anyone can look at the gameplay and see for themselves. If you compare the amount of new content in ANY of the other Pokemon remakes such as HGSS or ORAS, you can see a stark contrast with BDSP. You can even simply compare it with the other Pokemon games that have been released on the switch. This does NOT look or feel like a Gen 8 game. It is a direct downgrade.

Well, the answers is obvious. It's just a product to sold because in the cover is written ""Pokémon"". Nothing else.
Yes, they added something like the undergrounds upgrade, you can think that all people that tell ""hey this game is awesome buy it now it's Pokémon!"" are right, but it's what we fan asked? It's what we deserve? No. Absolutely no. Nobody asked for this things, we just wanted a damn, exactly the same, Pokémon Platinum with better graphic. Nothing else. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl suck.

OctaneNitro,25-11-2021,"Diamond & Pearl were the first Pokémon games I ever played, and yet these remakes sadly left me disappointed compared to both the originals, and the even better Pokémon Platinum.

Before discussing the pros/cons of BDSP, let's compare them to previous remakes in the franchise:

Firered/Leafgreen took graphically dated GB games and gave them an appealing GBA artstyle. Heartgold/Soulsilver were also visual upgrades, fixing issues in the originals (such as fleshing out Kanto), and were arguably the most packed Pokémon games ever. Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire weren't AS content rich, but still gave their originals a brand new 3D perspective and reimagining.

Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl, in contrast, do none of the above, with an incredibly strict approach that harms the games overall.

BDSP's graphics are a prime example of this. Technically, they do an ok job of translating the look of the originals to the Switch, yet still offer no significant utilisation of the platform's capabilities whatsoever. All hopes for a reimagined, fleshed out Sinnoh were immediately killed by the artstyle, with several fanmade mockups (e.g. Millenniumloops' on Youtube) showcasing this missed potential.

Unfortunately, this general lack of ambition extends to the rest of these games.

Pokémon Platinum, released twelve years ago, added an expanded post-game, a wider variety of Pokémon, and countless graphical details to Sinnoh. Meanwhile, BDSP leave out almost all of these objective enhancements in the name of ""faithfulness"". Diamond/Pearl are hardly the most gruelling, tricky games to remake today, yet ILCA couldn't even add back content from a decade old DS game.

I'd be willing to forgive this approach, however, if BDSP were genuinely faithful remakes... but in line with Gamefreak's modern design philosophy (favouring simplicity), countless tweaks were made to the original games. BDSP, for example, work in Sword/Shield's EXP Share: an item you cannot turn off, despite being able to do so in the originals. Additionally, Sword/Shield's affection system is present, allowing Pokémon to cheat battles (e.g. by dodging attacks) if they have a high affection stat. Together, these features practically erase challenge.

Even more bafflingly, many welcome quality of life changes WERE removed. Reusable TMs? Gone. The Underground and contests? Simplified. The Frontier Brain theme? Gone. ILCA were perfectly happy adding in unfaithful features to classic experiences, yet also cut modernisations that might've improved the games overall.

Pokémon Brilliant Diamond & Shining Pearl simply don't live up to their originals, Platinum, or previous Pokémon remakes. Other than overworld Pokémon, recreating Gen 4's mythical events, and the rework of HMs, I struggle to find even the slightest hint of ambition in these games.

BDSP aren't terrible games, but they ultimately deliver the bare minimum overall",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The music was alright not the best but not the worse, except the battle theme for all the gym battles... that was bad. And theres not alot of new stuff for a ""remake"", mostly just the cynthia fight being a little harder but not much of a challenge. Also the game kinda crashed twice through out my playthrough but it happens to most of my games. So to me, the game sucked hard and felt more like a 3ds game and not a switch title which is sad. And the whole ""artisticstyle"" to the game looked terrible with unecessary close ups on the characters and very flat textures, giving the game a very unfinished state.

It's actually odd to me that they would remake a pokemon game that's universally known as the worst in the franchise, but seeing as they gave it to someone else entirely to do it's a bit more understandable. It looks terrible. I know it's switch, so you have to cut it some slack but at the point of making this the originals can be bought for less than the 60 dollar asking price so why pay so much more for something that already looks so dated? It's choppy and slow, and buggy. It takes a wild amount of time to start up. At least 4 times the amount of a sword and shield start up. there's all kinds of weird art decisions which can be nice at times and then down right WTF at others. A lot people have been exploiting all the bugs to give the game some sort of enjoyment out of the game. Which is fine, games have their bugs and exploiting them is also part of the fun at times, but whenever they patched these they broke other functions within the game that were actually declined to be achieved in the game after you had beaten it. So perhaps they just decided to punish new players and current ones who actually use their switch for anything other than cheating. Not worth the time. Certainly no where close to the price.

ND-Bringer,02-12-2021,"My greatest fears have come true, the remake of my very first Pokemon game has not only let me down, but it's made me furious. This play through has been one of the most miserable experiences of my life. This remake fails hard to capture the premium experience in Sinnoh. I know that updates are being made to correct most of the game's problems...but trust me, it won't be enough. The game starts with...NOTHING. Just a black screen that says press A with the game's title hovering in the empty void. Seriously? I heard the newest update gives the game an opening cutscene that looks fine enough, but players have to wait about a week just to see it? The game begins with the standard tutorials that completely mirror the beginning of Diamond and Pearl. Now, for a remake trying to capture the feelings of the original is a daring feat, especially since this time Gamefreak has left the development of this game into ILCA's care this time. But their's a little TOO MUCH mirroring. This game is reflection of almost everything the originals had, including all the problems. Ponyta is now once again, the only obtainable fire type Pokemon to be found in the wild. Almost all of Sinnoh Ultimate Evolutions like Probopass, are now somewhat impossible to obtain. And the majority of trainers use the exact same Pokemon, hope you have fun fighting hundreds of Geodude with their Focus Sash style Study ability! This is horrible! Pokemon Platinum is often praised for enhancing the Sinnoh experience and fixing all the problems the originals had...but this game brought them all back! Because of this, the game feels like limbo. I'm fighting trainers that use Pokemon with no attack moves! Team Galactic are using high leveled Wumple and cocoon Pokemon, thinking its good idea! It's a real shame because the Gym Leaders and the Elite Four are actually formidable this time. Their teams have high EV stats, held items, and good move sets. I wish I could give them a fair fight, but that's impossible because my Pokemon team has become somewhat invincible thanks to the power of friendship. Ever since Pokemon X and Y, by playing activities in Pokemon Amie your Pokemon will become close to you and gain extra power during battle. They can dodge most attacks, shake off poison, and land powerful attacks with ease. It takes away the challenge from battle...but thankfully, these abilities only activate if you play the mini games, keeping the difficulty in tact. BUT IN THIS GAME, it activates no matter what. Now I to read this annoying, ""I knew you could do it!"" message every time I knockout a Pokemon during battle. It was repetitive enough that these trainers use the same god-damn monsters. I got to PRAISE my Pokemon every time it defeats a wimpy Magikarp! After reaching Eterna City and re-exploring the exterior of Eterna Forest because my game crashed for some reason, I gained the ability to explore the ""Grand Underground"". In the past the underground area was big part of the originals. You can mine for treasure, build your own secret base, and prank your friends with traps. But now, the Grand Underground acts as an extra dungeon to explore. While I'm disappointed that can only decorate my secret base with statues now, I don't mind this new addition. You can still mine for rare treasure and with a little luck, you can find a rare Pokemon to add to your team. It's not a ground breaking new mechanic, but it doesn't annoy me. I think the fact that some Pokemon are only obtainable as rare spawns is tedious, but I've seen worse spawning mechanics in Sword and Shield. Other updated features include the Pokemon Super Contests. But now all you do is the dancing mini game. Come on guys! I loved dressing up and performing with my Pokemon back in the day! I would prepare treats to upgrade my Pokemon's contest abilities, but I don't want to break my controller. You know, the original Diamond and Pearl games weren't master pieces by any means, but they inspired people. They inspired Spike Chunsoft to create the awesome lore of Mystery Dungeon Explorers. There's a ton of Pokemon fan fiction about how Dialga manipulates time. Generation 4 was the generation of inspiration. All sorts of great spin-off games were being made, the anime was improving by leaps and bounds, the Pokemon gods were born as well as the creator of the gods, and generation 2 was getting stellar new remakes. Oh HeartGold and SoulSilver...I haven't seen an incredible remake in years. Omega, Alpha, Let's Go, and DX were fine Remakes they just weren't fireworks. But these remakes set a new low for Pokemon. They barely offer anything new to the table and bring back problems that were already fixed in Platinum. Pokemon X and Y was generic and easy, but at least it was trying some new ideas.

Warning: Physical copy of game is not full game because it's on patch 1.10 and with patch 1.1.1 comes everything else that was promised and showcased but it's not on cartridge.

Anyway...
Game will not put you in amazing Pokemon experience ... not even close.
Visuals are not bad (as some say) if you can go past the chibi style. That's the decision that they choose and I'm ok with it.

But! Game is lacking to provide you enjoyable experience. In fact it gets so boring after few hours that you are put on place where you have to force yourself just to play to complete the game that you bought. Quickly you come to realisation how much you are generally overpowered despite what choice you make. Which eliminates almost every possible challenge that this game could provide.
After a short while you will start to avoid every unnecessary encounter just to continue breezing through game and even with that being done, you are still way to powerful compared to NPC trainers.

Even more, if you add that there are literally not fighting animations, it get's even worse. Only reason why there are positive reviews is because it's Pokemon...

Pros:
- it's Pokemon

Cons:
- gameplay
- cash grab

Visuals: 7/10 (if you don't mind chibi style)
Animations: 0/10 (there is none in fighting)
Sound: 7/10 (since 1.1.1 patch)
Controls: 6/10 (moving through options, running, riding bike with analog sticks is pain)
Gameplay: 3/10 (gameplay is generally boring because there is no challenge at all)
Value: 3/10 (this is not worth 60$, it's closer to 15$)
Replayability: 2/10 (if you decide to take Elite 4 over and over again, otherwise 0)

Conclusion:
It's Pokemon game and if you are fan or like the genre feel free to try it out but be sure that you buy used physical copy (there are lots of them being sold right now for 30-40$) so that you can sell it afterwards. Why? Because you sure will want to. Even with that price you will feel ripped off.
So get used physical copy, sell it after you see yourself and save some money to buy Arceus.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Amon2906,22-11-2021,"This game is literally the minimum of a pokemon game. It only has the base content a pokemon game should have, thats it. After 1 hour, the gameplay just repeats itself. Go there-beat gym leader-go there. On the way of your adventure, you literally chase the same 3-4 wild pokemon every single time. Its always either geodude, ponyta, kricketune or bidoof.

The graphic style can of course not please anybody, but that is not the bad thing. The bad thing is, how they implemented it. I like chibi art style, bot those character models in combination with those bad animation, is just ugly. There are many frame issues also.

Next: The game is just too easy. I know, pokemon games are not popular for their difficulty, but this is a nightmare. their decision to force the player to use the exp. share, does make it even worse. Battles arent fun anyomore, because you already know you win, easily. Even though I tried to avoid as many battles as possible, I still was overleveled with at least 4 levels.

Now it gets to the worst of all: The connex club. Wtf is this. It doesnt even work right. In comparison to the online systems of the last decade, this is a joke. You can only battle and trade, and thats it. If you join a room, there is literally one person, that isnt even moving. No one can accept your requestions and thats just pretty dumb. Connex club was not a bad idea back then: But it isnt anymore. I cant understand why the implemented this it didnt age well.

loneliiii,22-11-2021,"As a fan of the old original games, I was just dissapointed with the remakes. The graphics are stunning, but that doesn't matter, when the game just doesn't feel good.
The Controls are a mess, most notably the bike controls. You just can't ride or walk in cycles, like in Sword and Shield, its a mixture or Grid based and free roam.
so the player just stop at certain points or running against a wall because its so imprecise. more negative points:
-walking with a partner-npc and you try to walk trough it, he glitches trough you.
-Even building up a team don't make much fun, because of the auto-XP-share. why battling with every teammate, when you can just play with one pokemon and everyone else get XP.

LCBane,22-11-2021,"A safe recreation of the base games without addressing the real issues of the originals and the implementations Platinum put in order to combat them and create something special. BD struggles to find a foothold in the shadow of the incoming release of Legends: Arceus and is a disappointment compared to previous remakes.

Gameplay:
The game replicates all the nostalgia of the originals without including many of the quality of life changes that have been implemented in recent generations. Whether that be unlimited-use TM's
mega evolutions, limited pokedex etc. The game also takes much the difficulty away as less and less trainers have the reinvigorated rosters they included in Platinum. Spare Cynthia and the EF who actually have properly spec'd teams EVs maxed and all. With a mandatory exp share your levels soon far exceed those you face as the Pokémon in your party passively gain more exp than ever before and this cannot be turned off. Without going into too much detail there are still many many glaring issues in the games code letting you surf across trainers and dry land, soft lock in unprecedented areas such as gym puzzles and even completing the game and becoming champion with 6 or 7 gym badges only. Many more issues come from not being able to pick up items, losing items or even the strange clerical issues like frame rate changes when you turn off all sounds the game just runs better.

The return of older mechanics that were not properly updated sees many disappointed in this title as well. Honey trees having a small chance of any pokemon at all when activated and the rates on those pokemon are low already. The changes to the great marsh are also present with atrocious rates as well. All of the date and time mechanics are blocked behind a 24 hour cd if the system changes time when the game is started. Meaning if you got the game on friday and were looking to get your drifloon you would have to wait an entire week after you defeated team galactic. You could change the date and time to carry over to next week but still have a 24 hour cooldown in order to get your pokemon encounter.

Story:
The pacing of the story is still at a standstill removing even more of the difficulty from the originals with bugged/broken friendship and affection systems that multiplicatively stack granting your pokemon higher crit rates, first move regardless of being outsped, living on 1 hp over and over, even getting rid of status effects on a whim. Pair this with the omission of the changes platinum took to keep you moving and involved in the story it slugs on with its main story at a snails pace with zero post game offered.

Graphics:
Returning to something reminiscent of the original games was a good approach however the chibi art style does not mesh with the blocky tile system of old well. However the graphics in battles are some of the best we have seen of any switch title. Despite the lack of improvements in battle animations and move animations the overall feel and look of the pokemon, characters, and backgrounds is great in battle. A sharp contrast to the plastic, dead world outside of combat. Sadly however the rest of the game looks like a reskinned DS and the technologies age shows in the tile systems movement and feel around the world.

Music:
The music is a fresh take on the originals and brings life to where the graphics aren't to scratch. The new renditions are great reimagining's of their inspirations and provide a great feel when playing. The overall level of quality to the sound design and music is great but lacks some of the spark a full orchestra had with the music of sword and shield and other recent titles.

Overall:
Much more can be said about what I enjoyed or disliked about this game however the main points are clear. These games are simply a time sink for fans and the pokemon company and nintendo wanted a free money grab with zero effort and left it to a subsidiary licensed company. little to no imagination was brought to reinvigorate and improve these games from the original. including the bare minimum to keep the masses buying, Sitting in the shadow of what's to come with half baked Legends: Arceus, BDSP fails to create a rendition of the originals that stands up to previous remakes such as HGSS and ORAS let alone what Platinum accomplished to improve the generation.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

So it was kind of sad to see that a lot of the core design remains unchanged and somewhat outdated. Like online trading is exactly the same. None of the improvements brought by later games are here. At least shared EXP introduced in X and Y is here. That is nice at least. Core issues like slow battles and HM's were fixed. But they cheated to fix it. Like with HM's, they didn't redesign the game or add any major new features. It just simply allows you to use HM's without needing you to assign them to a Pokemon. It honestly just seems like the same game just in 3D. I'm okay with the graphics, there sort of doing it like in Link's Awakening. But what ultimately disappoints me is how this compares to Ruby and Sapphire Remake. I had no love for the original games since I didn't grow up with them. But I love the remakes of those games.

OnlyOneHere,21-11-2021,"This game is extremely expensive. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a remake. That is $20 more than what the original was at launch. In what world does a remake/remaster cost more than the original? Usually you would expect a cheaper price from an old game getting reworked, especially one that is 15 years old. If it is the same price as the original, you would expect a collection, but the developers were too greedy for that. Keep in mind that this is only half of the game at $60, and it doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. It will cost you a total of $120 if you want to experience the full game. Imagine charging $120 for a remake of a 15 year old game. This outrageous greed makes EA and Take-Two look like saints in comparison.

The graphics are a joke. The physics are beyond horrible. Every time my Pokemon attacks or gets attacked, it will have the same lazy animation as always. This is a 2021 $60 game. At this point, I should be seeing a variety of animations and physics in Pokemon battles that resemble what I've seen in the Pokemon TV show. We already have AAA games that can somewhat replicate big budget movies, yet the developers of this game can't even replicate an old cartoon.

armageddon37000,21-11-2021,"The worst remaster and the worst pokémon game at a time.

I’ve been playing pokémon and red and blue games on game boy since I was 8 years old. I’ve done every generation, year after year.

In 2003, game freak released remakes of red and blue, red light and green leaf, excellent and taking into account the 2 and 3g, with all pokémon from 1g to 3g and all objects.

In 2010, game freak released the remake of gold and silver, soul silver and gold hearthgold, pushing the limits of the games, taking into account the innovations of the 2g, excellent and taking into account the 1, 2 3 and 4g, with all the pokémon from 1g to 4g and all the objects.

In 2013, game freak released the ruby and sapphire, omega and alpha sapphire remakes, with a real 3d, and a hallucinating post game, new shapes for the legendary, pushing the limits of what they did, excellent and taking into account the 1, 2 3, 4g, 5 and 6g, with all pokémon from 1g to 6g and all objects.

Then came out sword and shield, games of the 8g, mediocre, graphically ugly and especially incomplete games because amputated half of the pokémon, added 1 year later, by deleting all the novelties of the 5 6 and 7g, like the mega, etc.

But these very mediocre diamond and pearl remasters (because yes, they are not remakes) reach heights in terms of disrespect towards the players, and in terms of laziness:

- The game has an ugly chibby style, making the heads of the characters huge, as in the 6g.

- No real 3d, instead you have a graphically wrong diamond and pearl remaster.

- ONLY the first 493 pokémon. From 1g to 4g. Why game freak?

- You will roll all the way to the league, because of the multi exp activated from the beginning. You will be between 10 and 15 levels ahead of the trainers, who have only 2 or 3 pokémon at most.

- ALL novelties from the 5 g removed, so say goodbye to mega evolution, z crystals, dynamax, AND all objects released after 4G. So goodbye to objects like evolution or headphones, very useful in strategy.

- No new form for Dialga and Palkia.

Let’s talk about the strategy:

In addition to the fact that some pokémon are doomed to stay zero in strat, by the fact that they have lost their mega, like florizarre or dracaufeu, and by the fact that half of the pokémon and objects are missing,

pokémon like dimoret or mamochon are rendered unusable, as they all lose vital attacks in their sets. Tentacruel can no longer learn toxic and toxic peaks, jirachi no longer has iron head, Melodelfus and leuphoria lose teleport, etc.

The reasons for this shipwreck:

Pokémon is one of the most profitable licenses in the world. The game freak editors, the pokemon company, want to do even more profile, so they pushed game freak to delegate the development of remakes to third-party developers, in this case ILCA, Inc., to focus on the development of pokémon arceus, which will be out early next year.

Except that not in fact, you do not entrust the development of one of your most anticipated games to third parties, neither qualified nor numerous enough to do it. This leads to all the problems mentioned above.

So exploration is ruined, ruined by ugly and old graphics and chibby. The fights are ruined, ruined by the frustration of all those missing pokémon and by the constantly activated basic multi exp, making the game ultra simple. The game is ruined by this regression of 10 years , we returned in 2010 to 4G.

So I will rate this game on what it is:

- 5 points for chibby style and ugly graphics, in addition to not having made us a 3d of the quality of the 3G remakes. There is no 3d, AT ALL.

- 5 points for deleting all issued pokémon and all objects after 4G as well as for the fact that the legendary ones do not have new shapes to make them stronger.

- 5 points for removing new features from 5G to 8G and for the multi exp ruining the adventure.

So it’s a nice 5/20, for the fact of having at least (mdr), real 3D fights, and the return of a nice gen in terms of level design.

bladeRoller,26-11-2021,"So to say these are bad remakes, is just untrue. The visuals, surprisingly for once from a pokemon game, are actually quite good. The in combat maps are gorgeous, and *finally* match the location you started the battle. The pokemon move animations are FAR BETTER than the last 2 entries, and even approach collisseum levels of quality. The story and game is faithful in all the right ways, and even improved upon some quality of life aspects. You can now access the box from anywhere, and you get the running shoes much earlier. You can move on any axis or on the grid depending on your inputs. You grand underground now gives you access to a greater selection of pokemon, allowing you to tailor your team better in the early game, and is far more robust. In the grand underground you can now collect cool statues of some of your favourite pokemon, in various raritiy. Those statues affect the odds of what wild pokemon youll find roaming the underground's many unique underground biomes. This adda a great deal of extra exploration, and gameplay to the original titles. Additionally, theyve added a helpful tip in the menu on where you should go next if you wish to progress the main story.

Some cons, I feel that the choice of the chibi aesthetic while in the overworld is cute and all, but this game was deserving of a much more cinematic overworld to match its beautiful in combat visuals and overworld environments. They already made the more humanoid models, they should have had them be the overworld models, if simplified for the switch's limited graphic capabilities. The grand underground secret bases no longer offer furniture, which is very dissapointing for many who used them as an outlet for creativity. This didnt need to be taken away, and would have worked fine with the statues. There are some minor graphical errors that rarely occur. People can potentially hard lock themselves by saving in nefarious locations, they should have a ""return to entrance"" option built in.

While the outfits being changeable is a great improvement, they should include more, or at least give more freedom in character creation (hair and eye colours, skin tones). These would be simple to implement. As it is, the options are quite limited. I hope for an update soon.

In summary, these are fantastic remakes, with some needed small improvements. I also believe they made some creative decisions i disagree with, but are not inherently bad.

First of all, the game is fine, just fine. It's ok if it was yet another indie title, but it is not what the pokemon community and especially gen 4 kids deserve. It's rather baffling how the pokemon company, gamefreak and associates think it's alright to just give us mediocrity. What's even more mysterious is how the fandom is willing to pay a whole 60 bucks for mediocrity. Pokemon D&P was basically my first conscious entry to the pokemon universe, It was the last game I have played with my elementary school friends, before we parted ways. So after hearing news of a remake, I was thrilled. Just to be let down by some android mobile game looking reskin. I wanted to get the ORAS treatment, which by far wasn't the best remake either, but it elevated the game onto a new level. They went the easy route. Gamefreak is too ambitious for their own good. They need to outsource projects, because they cannot handle them with their own resources. I honestly even doubt their resources are enough to handle the upcoming Legends Arceus title.

The beginning of the game well, like any other adventure, except that you level up too fast, my choice was to chimchar and not once weakened to the 3 medal, I did not need to go to a pokemon center, I did not have the need to change pokemon is It can only handle everything without any problem, also the graphic section has shocked me, being pleasant in some details and horrible in others, the worst thing is that on the way to my 2 medal with just over two hours, some npcs give me MEW AND JIRACHI as a gift as if they were pidgeys or caterpies or something simple, breaking all the initial immersion ... The next thing are Legendary initials? ... Many visual and programming errors, it looks like a 3DS game, very poor and pixelated textures, in tv many pixels are appreciated and it does not look like HD, chibi models look pixelated, eyes, eyebrows, mouth, as well as furniture inside the game that seems to be taken from a ds library, such as zooms that go back and forth wrongly programmed When should the zoom be removed? e the battle at the end of the combat, lights that blink at some point, npcs going through things and so on, the adventure is the same as in DS only they have added some platinum things to their will, the story is simple but full of Lore, making a remake we hope they take advantage of the game, the story, everything including the console, and they have not taken advantage in any way to innovate or give a quality product, after getting mew and jirachi as if they were nothing they took away my desire to play and here the question should I have spoiled in leaks to see that and not have so important pokemon at the beginning of the game ...?

In summary, completely wasted remakes, with new mechanics that break the immersion and the difficulty of the game, like mythical pokemon at the beginning of the game.

PS: A Pokemon adventure ride where it gets interesting after half the game, but at the same time it is too easy and without any challenge.

Just as you complain about those who do BOMBING, they complained about those who give a high score to a poor quality product for $ 60.
Be realistic.

First, you didn't re-imagined the remake, no Gen5-8 Pokémon, version exclusive is too difficult for trade, poor glitches, and same basic gameplay. It was worse than the original that I got when I was a kid. HM's and contests are like same but it was too lackluster. Also, the presentation and story are still the same, instead of scrapping like Great Marsh, it was awful without freedom. National Pokedex is too difficult, so no National Pokedex NOWWWWW!

So what you're left with is an indentical game to the originals, with a divisive super-chibi art stytle, and none of the improvements Platinum brought to the table.
Oh, and the amie battle bonuses, which used to be optional and out of the way, are now forced on you through regular gameplay. This is a big design flaw imo as it further trivialiizes an already easier game.

JSwizzle86,21-11-2021,"Very poorly made remake. While the expansions to old features are nice, forced exp share on from the start, several gamebreaking bugs, sluggish battles, and softlocks in places such as Snowpoint Gym make for an awful experience. You're better off playing Pokemon Platinum than this rehashed ""remake"" trash. You don't even get to customize your character until way later into the game, and Platinum outfits are locked behind paid internet for Mystery Gift. These games have the same problem as the last three gens have had; too much lenience in the direction of newcomers, and almost nothing for veterans to sink their teeth into. Not to mention how awful grid-based movement and stiff turns look in a completely 3D environment.
The few good things are mostly expanded on in postgame, such as rematches, the new Park, and more stuff to catch in the Underground.
Otherwise, save your money. The worst part is that these games can have their versions changed with a single flag of its code being changed, so anyone who paid for the double pack was ripped off big time. Play Platinum, Renegade Platinum, or just old DP. The ""National PokeDex"" doesn't really contain anything beyond Gen 4, and Leafeon/Glaceon/Gliscor/Dusknoir (fanfavorites) are all stuck in postgame because they used the DP item distribution.

As such, it is hard for me to give this game anything more than a 1, because no game was ""made"" here, everything is just copied. But, I will give it a 1 instead of a 0 because it is an actual game that turns on and that you can win. Considering the 60$ price tag though, to anybody that really wants to play this: I recommend playing pokemon platinum from 2009. Pokemon platinum is this game but better, because it has more content and it has pixel art instead of the visuals of this game, which unfortunately don't look good and are very reminiscent of a mobile game. Pokemon platinum is also a more challenging experience as there is no mandatory ""Exp share"" item to boost your pokemons' levels beyond your opponents'.

Not only that, but the graphics are among the worst on the Switch. Following Pokemon, one of the very few additions, are completely botched. Pokemon scaling from Lets Go didn't come back. No Battle Frontier. No Platinum Gym leader team and puzzles - the list goes on.
One of the only positives I can think of is the soundtrack - while not incredible by any means, it's pretty faithful and doesn't trump on the original, with some tracks being better than others.

-Little to no Platinum features (no Charon, Looker, or Villa for example)
-Costs about 9-6 more dollars (assuming you bought DP/Pt when they released for $40) than the originals when accounting for inflation and not including a NSO subscription
-Forced EXP Share, regardless of if you hated grinding or not
-OP Amie buffs upon reaching 100% friendship
-Scuffed following Pokémon mechanic with the same exact issue SwSh had with some Pokemon being incredibly slow even though they literally got it correct in LGPE
-Overworld Pokémon scaling so bad it’s hilarious
-Only the original 493, not even any regional forms which even LGPE had (the same game that also cut cross-gen evos)
-Still has many issues that plague the Pokémon series (Clunky and slow battle system with text boxes for everything, bad in-battle scaling, static/boring idle and attacking animations, lack of difficulty options)

Uncle_Flipp,21-11-2021,"When it comes to keeping their word, Pokemon Company is top notch. both Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl and very faithful remakes to the original games of Diamond and Pearl. They are so faithful that they severely harm the quality of the game.

Diamond and Pearl were great games for their time. They had a fantastic story, great characters, and the strongest champion ever, but the games weren't without their problems. Even the Pokemon Company and Gamefreak recognized that Diamond and Pearl needed something else to truely be a well rounded game with re-playability. That is where Platinum came in. Platinum added so many amazing quality of life features, an alternate and in my opinion better story line, as well as more post game features. So why is it that BDSP does not include many of the features from Pokemon Platinum that even the Pokemon company recognized as necessary to make the game better? This decision was a huge folly and if they decide to implement an alternate story line later to make up for this mistake, it better be a free expansion and not cost money.

Next, I would like to discuss the graphics. The graphics of Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl have easily been the most controversial decision that was made for these remakes. Ever since the announcement of the chibi design is has been the most argued about feature in these two games. I won’t lie; I was one of the people who were abhorrently against this decision because it felt like a choice made to be lazy during game design and also felt like the games were going backwards, instead of forwards. Even though I hated the decision at first, the chibi design actually grew on me to the point that I don't hate it, but I don't love it. It still feels like it was a choice made to save time and cut corners under the ruse of ""staying faithful"" to the originals. After so many hours of playing I have grown accustomed to the chibi design and think overall this was a good decision, but terribly executed. In 2021, if you are going to remake a beloved game in a chibi design even though previously released games weren't chibi, then the models must look great, you need to use angles that make the chibi models look alive, and the movements and controls of all the chibi models must be smooth. Everything I just mentioned was failed on. The chibi models were poor quality and looked lifeless. Slopily, adding bouncing movement to certain parts of the model like hair and arms doesn’t make the character look alive, it looks robotic and poorly programmed. Also, the faces have blank stares and don’t move further bringing attention to the robotic nature of the models. On top of that the game tries to use camera angles as a wow factor, but the camera angles end up zooming in on the ugly character models they developed. Not every character looked terrible but a majority of them did. Any time you aren’t zoomed in on a chibi model the chibis look fine. Then you have the slightly terrible background graphics. Why is the upper third of the screen blurry like you are playing a character that is near sighted? The blurriness of the screen actually hurts my eyes after a while. The mixture of fast camera movements with the blurriness has even given me an occasional migraine.
Lastly, I would like to discuss the controls for the game. There are three major complaints I have with the controls. First is the terrible reaction time between controller and character. If you are already going left and try to go right, there is a 1 second delay before the character even turns around. If you needed an example of good controls for a chibi, then look at Animal Crossing New Horizons. In ACNH The chibi model has a great reaction time between chibi and controller. This delay in turning adds to my second complaint which is the ridiculous “Sticky Wall” feature as I’ve come to call it. For some reason if you accidently touch a wall when walking/running your character will slightly be stuck and there in another second delay before your character can turn away from the wall in another direction. This is extremely irritating when you consider that the running is so fast, yet the areas are so narrow with tons of obstructions.
Overall, this game is riddled with problems. There are indie games made by a team of 6 people that have higher quality graphics and better controls than BDSP. Which is a sad statement considering that Pokemon is the single biggest game franchise in the world by a long shot. The only reason I didn’t give these games a lower rank is because of it very few redeeming factors like it’s fantastic soundtrack, the Grand Underground (which we will probably never see in a future game knowing Pokemon company), and the fact that they kept the champion Cynthia at a high difficulty level. Unfortunately, these redeeming factors aren’t enough to make this a good game.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC
AquaArmour,20-11-2021,"Been waiting for a Diamond and Pearl remake for about a decade now, excited for when it would be finally Sinnohs time. Pokemon Diamond is my favourite game of all time, and it hurts to see this game turn out to be such a disappointment.

The graphics are bland, the chibi art style doesn't fit the grand story and lore of simmoh at all. The textures are faded and blurry. Only good thing I can say about the graphics is that I like the post processing bloom and depth of field. The beautiful faded bluish green grass of sinnoh has been replaced by ugly high contrast dark green.

Gameplay is copied directly from the originals, with the map being 100% block to block recreation of the originals. Most of the features are the same, but some features are even take away. All the platinum features, the exp share as an item etc. are all missing. The exp all breaks the entire leveling curve, which would have been fine if it was adjusted, but that was ripped directly from the originals as well.

The marketing seems to hide behind the term faithful remake, which all the defenders of the game seem to parrot. Pokemon remakes were already relatively faithful compared to what other developers were doing with their remakes. Every Pokemon remake before this was able to stay faithful while still adding a lot to the table. The faithful remakes term seems to be just an excuse for not adding meaningful content to the game. Game design decisions need to benefit the game in some way right? art wise or gameplay wise? This does neither, so it is obvious it was a time and budget saving measure. Making the game faithful does not benefit anyone at all, old fans or new.

Thorai,21-11-2021,"This is honestly the worst Pokemon game I've played so far. I just finished the league and I have no motivation whatsoever to even go on playing or look at anything postgame. I am severely disappointed.

The good:
- The new Underground is great

The bad:
- Incredibly boring, repetitive gameplay
- Poor style, even if you like the chibi-look, the movement in cutscenes is unnatural and clunky
- EXP-share makes any grinding the originals might have needed redundant.. but of course they leave in every single trainer that you needed back then, forcing you into unavoidable battles that feel like a waste of time.
- They abandoned everything Platinum improved on for an utterly boring story. Yes, our 'Fire Type' Elite 4 still only has 2 Fire Types in his team of 5. Because the only ones that exist, outside of the Underground, are the Fire Type starter... and Ponyta. 2. In the entire game.
- The former Touchscreen Poketch features are basically unuseable with how much of a hassle it is toeven try and use them

My playthrough experience: For about 28 hours I fought the same 15 or so Pokemon over and over, mostly consisting of pokemon in their unevolved forms somewhere between level 15 and 30 while your own team has already passed level 40. Half of that time it's either Trainers with Bidoof, Bugs, 5 magicarps or at least 4 Geodudes and 1 Onix with sturdy... which all give you about 20 to 30 exp. While in the grass the NPC is standing in you can find the evolved form of what they're using at about 6 levels higher. In heavy contrast to that, the Gym fights are suddenly 15 levels higher than the trainers you fought right before that and actually pack a punch. Which would be great if the way there wouldn't be an utter chore.
The only enjoyable part is Victory Road where you are suddenly encountering Trainer types never seen before, using evolved Pokemon of a decent level, making you actually feel like this is worth your time. And then we come to the Elite 4... which seem to have Pokemon with perfect IVs and EVs as, for some reason, even a 7 levels lower Golem manages to outspeed and oneshot your darling Penguin. In the end, despite beating the Elite 4 in what could be a thrilling battle, the game leaves you too drained and annoyed to even feel any joy for beating Cynthia.
Sadly, that makes a grand total of maybe 1 hour of 'interesting fights' within the 30 hours of gameplay it took me to get through.

In summary: I regret buying the game and wasting my time. If you miss Diamond and Pearl, play Platinum instead. If this had been a Remake of Platinum, which already covered so many of its predecessors weaknesses, it might have been a good game... but this way, they were basically shown what to do to improve their C-Grade game into an A-Grade one - and decided to just put a little graphics-glitter on top instead of anything else, then wondering why it's still C-Grade.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Por otro lado pierdo horas en el sub suelo, atrapando PKM poruqe si hay algo que disfruto es juntar la pokedex y tener una especie de cada uno de los PKM que se pueden obtener en cada juego, el conseguir un PKM legendario de nuevo es un reto pues para poder ir a atrapar uno se necesitan algunos items que solo salen en el subsuelo y no son nada fácil de que salgan.

Al final lo estoy disfrutando mucho, no tengo que pagar un DLC para sentir más completa la experiencia como con Sword, pero si se nota que el juego fue hecho a las prisas pues que tenga varios bugs y aunque ya actualizaron en juego aun hay varios gliches, es el resultado de que el juego no fue terminado correctamente, y mi otra queja es que falta items, no entiendo por que hay items de 7 generación como las mentas y chapas pero no hay otros items como el Eviolite, Assaul Best o la Wickness Pilicy.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Maxentirunos,13-01-2022,"I really wanted to like this game but the more I played it, the more it felt like a ripoff cashgrab for my nostalgia of Gen4 and less like a pokemon remake.

Pokemon remakes are known to be the best remake made, adding new contents based on 3rd game of gen and actual recent gameplay. The last we got before BDSP was let's go, which while controversial with the new gameplay mechanic inspired by Go, was still a fantastic remake.

BDSP try to hide behind the 'faithful' excuse but actually only is for things that weren't working and were corrected in platinum. The chibi design is jarring weird when the story turn any seriousness. No, Chibi art isn't Pixel Artstyle and this ''pokemon before XY where all chibi'' must die. Any change is just a QoL like 3D deplacement that somehow break the game and can softlock you.

But not only this game is a downgrade from the platinum games, a 11 years old game, but also doesn't propose anything that would justify buying it over playing platinum or an hack of it.

The ability to run diagonally breaks a lot of the puzzles, but NPCs still walk on a grid and it just looks so awful. This is baseline pokemon experience. So obviously, if you like pokemon games, it will provide you with the basic level of fun that pokemon always provides. But I cannot stress enough how low effort this is.

The mining mini game is shallow but still fun to collect the different statues and new items. The original diamond and pearl was already solid.

Mecânica dos TM não sumirem da sua BAG agora não existe mais, eles somem igual aos jogos antigos, Pokémon agora não aprender outros golpes das outras gerações, exemplo disso é Zaptos que desde os jogos de Black/White aprende o movimento ""Hurricane"" e nesse REMASTE não e isso se aplica aos itens também por exemplo EVIOLITE todo mundo conhece esse item chatão, pois é ele nao faz parte desse jogo porque esse item só foi implementado na Quinta Geração.

Reclamaram tanto da Pokedex de SW/SH que nao tinha todos os pokemon, essa aq nem se fala porque a nacional só chega ate os pokemon da Quarta Geração.

Se é para pagar 300,00 reais na midia digital ou 480,00 reais na midia fisica ( EM UM JOGO DE SMARTPHONE) é melhor comprar o SW/SH ja que tem as mecânicas novas e sem tirar o fato de ter as batalhas ranqueadas que nesses jogos ele removerão.

Questão de graficos eu nao me importo se é chibi ou cartoonizado ( poderias ser igual de LETS' GO), porem o jogo é sem polimento, quando começa as batalhas simplesmente o campo some e fica um local todo branco, não é vivo igual do X/Y ou de SW/SH, Pokemon te seguindo fora da PokeBola ridiculo até HG/SS consegue fazer umas dimensões de tamanhos melhor que esse REMASTE.

Eu aconselho esperar o ARCEUS ( nao que seja bom, grafico pior q SW/SH), já que vai ser um jogo de pokemon com mundo semi aberto.

LSWSjr,08-02-2022,"From the makers of Pokémon Ransomware… sorry, I mean Pokémon Home… comes Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, 2021 Switch remakes of 2006 DS games that they’re ultimately inferior to.

Let’s start with the fact that these remakes require a Day One Patch almost as big as the game itself, which bodes well for future retro gamers who jump in after Nintendo finally shuts down the Switch store. A problem all three original releases lacked.

Even with the patch or let’s be honest, the other half of the game’s data which even combined is only 2/3 that of Sword and Shield’s upon release, these remakes are filled with numerous bugs, incomplete animations and brand new ways to both hard and soft lock your progress.

There are also a number of issues related to the change to a 3D perspective, with some content unintentionally obscured by buildings and other terrain, pathing being restricted/exploitable and awkward looking NPC movement, just to name a few.

Then we have the numerous features that have been changed for the worst. With Pokémon contests being stripped down to a single button rhythm game instead of a full side activity; the Grand Underground losing both its Hidden Base customisation, which has been replaced with a room of capture rate increasing statues, and its Capture the Flag mode; and finally, the rest of its online functionality is well… still unfinished as of the time of this review, three months after release… and like all mainline Switch Pokémon titles, most of the interactions are restricted to the version duo alone.

Beyond that is the strange mix of old and new mechanics, most notably the now standard party wide Auto-EXP Share feature, which removes a lot of the grinding but then sees your team over levelled for the majority of the game’s runtime provided you battle all the NPC trainers along the way… until we get to the Elite Four and Champion, who’ve been bolstered by perfect stats, along with competitive level tactics and move/item uses. It’s actually quite jarring of a difficulty spike and many have commented on it being too much for children and adults alike to handle.

As for the good additions, there’s the modern updates and rebalancing to the Pokémon and their move pools, as standard; the unwieldy 8 HMs of the originals have been replaced with interactions tied to gym badges; and most all of the trainer battle animations are very lively and unique.

Ultimately however, these remakes just pale in comparison, not only to the originals, but to previous remakes like Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Heart Gold and Soul Silver and yes, even Let’s Go Pikachu and Let’s Go Eevee in several respects. All of these previous remakes felt like they’d improved, innovated and updated enough over the originals to justify their existences, in my opinion.

Pokémon Diamond and Pearl had already received a definite rerelease in Pokémon Platinum some two years following, whilst the only serious innovation from these remakes is being able to play it on the TV, with a mix of new and reused 3D graphics and animations.

Short of a significant overhaul and/or DLC, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will remain the inferior versions out of the five.",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Also.. the more dense layout plays and feels better than Sword & Shield.

And the bike just needs skill and purpose; yes you need to practice and yes you need to get off the bike from time to time - which is more realistic than the older games where you sit on the bike everywhere outside. In this game walking still has a purpose :).

Next and last, everybody and their dog: “Platinum is so much better - Poketch has 2 buttons!”
Well who would have thought.. Brilliant Diamond has the better solution!

Brilliant Diamond is a surprisingly modest remake, compared to the two previous ones, as it doesn't add or change the plot of the original game in any way, which thus remains the same lackluster script that disappointed in 2006. As far as gameplay, the untouched level design of the original experience offers a rewarding exploration with a branching, layered map structure, but aside from that many changes have been made, which ultimately end up making Brilliant Diamond significantly worse than the original. The new Grand Underground areas are the only addition to the experience: they offer a surprisingly entertaining Dungeon Crawling side-activity with varied environments and treasures to find, but on the other hand the Super Contests and Underground Secret Bases have been dramatically simplified and dumbed down becoming shallow, hollow shells of their former selves. The challenge, one of the original game's strongest points, is completely shattered by enemies with levels that are increasingly inferior to the player's and a forced friendship mechanic that gratuitously gives the player an awkward unearned advantage, leaving only the overly simplistic, dull gameplay of the series. Only the postgame content offers a meaningful challenge, but even then it's extremely contained.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Kenmei,02-12-2021,"For anyone hoping to see a major upgrade for the 4th generation, you're going to be majorly disappointed with the results here. It feels like this was built entirely on the nostalgia from the people who once played it on the DS. There's very little changed here, and even some quality of life changes from later games arent here, like putting the store and poke center together in one building and making the move tutor free and in the same building. There's really only 3 major changes that people will recognize. The first is the graphics style, which you'll either love or hate and I really hated it. Mostly because all character models are rendered in full 3D during battle so not having them in 3D in the over world seems like a waste since the work was already done. Next is the HM being basically automated by ""wild"" pokemon in the area, even if the same 3 pokemon who use the HM's arent in the area you're using them. However the biggest change is the Grand Underground, where you'll be spending the majority of your time, especially during the end game. Frankly it doesnt hold a candle to alot of the options that Sword and Shield offered players. It becomes extremely repetitive and very boring after awhile but you have to grind out the mining system if you want to have a chance of getting the previous games legendaries. Which will already be out of date once the game gets access to Pokemon Home next month. Its fairly hard for me to recommend this game to anyone who may never have played the 4th generation. Especially since its not a remake of Platinum, one of the biggest and best ""3rd"" games of the generation in all of Pokemon. It just feels like not a ton of work went into trying to update this to modern day standards. And I can't figure if that was done on purpose, so that the game doesnt over shadow the Legends Arceus game next month, or if there was another reason involved. At this point I'd really only recommend it to those who grew up with this generation, like I did, and want to replay it on Switch. Outside of that, I'd say to just wait till next month when the main game comes out from Game Freak themselves.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

my first pokemon game in a long time
I havnt played a base line pokemon game since silver way back in the day, so I was excited to hop back into the remake of the 4th gen.. and while this game is great, its just not as magic as I remember pokemon games being.. The 4th en of pokemon introduces 107 new pokemon and none of them are really any exciting, as usual you start by choosing your favorite starter, and this time youre on a journey to stop team galactic whos going to these lakes and snatching up the regions legendary pokemon… and the story is pretty straightforward and therefor not really all that interesting..
Diamond and Pearl are very straightforward games in general, go through the routes, building up your team of pokemon which btw share exp from the start, so I had to do absolutely 0 grinding to beat this game… go to the gyms, take town the leader, get a badge, get an ability to progress through the world, an ability that you don’t have to attach to a pokemon to use, another change I love vs back in the day.. so no longer are you forced to have a party of pokemon for certain moves to progress the game, you no longer have to save spots in their move sets for a move you don’t really care about all that much..
But that’s it, that’s the game.. 30 hours of go from this town to this town… It was enjoyable but it was also a bit of a disappointment.. this wasn’t a world or story ill remember, there are no cool mysteries to solve in each town, they all kind of blend together.. This is probably one of the most forgettable monster collecting games ive every played..
That being said its still pokemon, its still addicting to build the best team possible trying to catch them all if you care to…

Even though I had no bugs and did not took advantage of any exploit I do know that those were or are still present.
The game looks pretty at a certain extent, there's character customization (not much but it's there) and the grand underground is very fun (even when they removed the secret bases feature); If you already played pokemon platinum in the past you are going to get bored really quick (Personally I only played 100 ish hours), you already know the story, characters, pokemons, locations, etc.. This game is not even developed by gamefreak they were very busy working on legends arceus AKA the better game (and it shows) In conclusion a very unnecessary remaster I would've preferred a platinum port for 20dlls to be honest than a diamond and pearl remaster, if you already played platinum and you are expecting a remake I would advise to not get this game or get it just for the nostalgia of it.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

So, far I'm about 8 hours in and I enjoying myself quite a bit.
It has the usual charm that you'd expect from a Pokemon game.

I'm glad we have some quality of life improvements that I'm pretty sure were not there before but this game is also a pretty big downgrade when compared with Sword and Shield.

The graphics are not great. The chiby aesthetic is pretty ugly. It's annoying how the game constantly switches between regular, big models and chiby stuff during play.
When gen 3 got a remake, it looked like latest gen games, not something much older.

There are also no more pokemon roaming in the overworld, sadly. When Let's go introduced that, I was expecting it to stick for all future titles.

Needless to say, it has all the usual issues of pokemon games. Easy, boring training battles, repetitive models, predictable story, etc.

Alvz9,27-12-2021,"Mis sensaciones al jugar este remake del clásico de DS son algo contradictorias. Por una parte me parece que el estilo artístico es un acierto, así como el espíritu de mantener gran parte de los elementos básicos del juego intactos (un remake visual, pero conservador en lo jugable). Pero me parece que ese es precisamente su cuchillo de doble filo: el mantener ciertos elementos que incluso en nuestros tiempos se antojan anticuados y contra ""las mejoras de calidad de vida"". Esta es una decisión muy arriesgada dentro de los remakes que ha sufrido la franquicia, ya que si consideramos VerdeHoja/Rojo Fuego, Lets go, Alma Plateada/Corazón de Oro, Omega Ruby/Safiro Alfa, todos tienen en común el lavado visual y la implementación de nuevas mecánicas que facilitan y vuelven aún más placentera la experiencia de juego. Diamante Brillante es tosco a nivel de diseño RPG, los pokémon salvajes son repetitivos y extramadamente pocos, los enemigos suelen utilizar entre 3 y 4 pokémon del mismo tipo y especie (muchas veces me encontré la situación de enfrentarme a un tipo con 4 Machop, otro con 3 Pikachu, y otro con 5 Wurmple). Las batallas no tienen elementos dinamizadores de entregas más reciente de la franquicia como las mega evoluciones, la posibilidad de conseguir otros pokémon distintos a los originales, o la renovación de ciertos combates legendarios. De hecho, el volver a luchar contra Cintia no se sintió de la misma forma que en DS, pues en parte ya casi todo el mundo sabía su estrategia principal; por ejemplo, un mega-Garchomp podría haber vuelto complicada la cosa. No hay giros de guión, todo está tal cuál; y los elementos nuevos (como por ejemplo las grutas), y parte del postgame la verdad es repetitivo y bastante soso. La inexplicable decisión de no conectar el juego con Pokémon Home tampoco ayuda mucho. Por último, a nivel visual si bien defiendo el estilo artístico, me parece que este se luce más de día que de noche, ya que de noche desaparece ese efecto más plastilina o brillante de juegos como el remake de Zelda Links Awakening. En conclusión: a mi juicio una oportunidad desperdicia, con un remake visual que en términos jugables es muy conservador. Se podría haber apostado a más como en los otros remakes, pero se optó por una decisión que me parece vuelve menos fresca la vuelta a Sinnoh.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

zycore718,12-10-2022,"There is absolutely no reason to buy this if you still have a copy of Platinum. BDSP offers less than a 10-year-old game for more money. Every other remake added a wealth of new stuff to the base game - yes, even ORAS. BDSP on the other hand got a slightly better Underground and that's it. It can't seriously call itself a remake on the same level as HGSS or even FRLG, the most basic remake which STILL at the very least added a brand new area to explore.

But then again that's what you get when the devs have literally only worked with 3D modelling before - you get essentially a port with pretty HD graphics but that is nearly identical in every way to Diamond and Pearl, which were screaming out for improvements.

But because Masuda hates acknowledging that other directors made his base games better, everything that made Sinnoh actually good in Platinum - the superior graphics, the better wild encounter roster and Trainer teams, the Battle Frontier, the Distortion World, the extra story, even LOOKER who is a popular character and has had cameos in OTHER GAMES - gets the shaft.

The sad legacy of BDSP will be a game that was given the middle finger by Game Freak, gutted by Masuda, sent out to die against the vastly superior Legends Arceus, and had to be completely modded by fans (thank you, Team Luminescent) to even get a somewhat decent final product.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
iMustang,03-12-2021,"Pokemon Brilliant Diamond is not a bad game by any means, but the sad truth is that it's also not a great game. Gamefreak contracted a separate company for this remake, and advertised it as a faithful top-down style remake. Another sad truth is, it's not faithful, leaving it in an odd middle ground that makes you ask ""Then what sort of remake is it?"" or ""Who was this made for?""

A vast majority of this game is identical to it's original counterpart with the sprites being replaced with chibi character models who, while looking jarring at times, do offer a unique approach. The choice to zoom in on character faces in this style is odd when they lack expression, though even odder is when they immediately zoom back out without a transition. In spite of this, the world itself does often look very good, and when character models are shown (like Gym Leader battles), it can look good sometimes. The game quickly separates itself from the original with some quality of life improvements (boxes anywhere, exp share, etc), but some that are just rather odd. HMs were removed, in favor of stacks of TMs. You can also use the HM moves without teaching them, but then the original obstructions of the game are little more than minor inconveniences as you explore. It was like they improved what you could do, without balancing what you can't do, so the entire game is more or less a straight path forward.

The two major changes found in the main story at the making or breaking point for many - Contests and The Underground. The contest system in generally considered ruined by most people who enjoyed the original, gutting the battle system with unique factors in favor of a mini game instead. Yes you still make poffins and teach moves for the contest, but it's nothing like original fans will remember. On the flip side, The Underground has been overhauled to be more of a Wild Area with easier (and sometimes earlier) access to Pokemon and endless hours you can explore. This element is a wonderful break from the linear story and is perfect if you like hunting certain Pokemon (including shiny ones).

Overall I did end up finishing this game with a good amount of fun being had, which I do take as a personal victory since I did not start off with much joy to be found. This game doesn't feel like an innovative remake with new ideas, nor does it feel like a faithful rendition of a classic, but I do feel like some effort was made by the developers. You can tell some thought and love was put into this game, which almost makes it even sadder when you stop to wonder how great it could have been if they could have been bolder, or if Gamefreak would have just made it themselves.

For example the remake only includes pokemon up to generation 4, when we are up to generation 8. Also the game has a weird art style which kinda suits the game but also makes it feel cheap, which I was not a fan of.

This game is not a bad game at all, but it could have been a 10/10 if it had the features from Pokemon Platinum and included new pokemon past Gen 4.

GreenMenace,13-06-2022,"Pokemon BDSP shouldn’t be your first Pokemon experience—it offers a greater challenge than other games, yes, but it fails to provide the quality of life changes seen by recent Pokemon games. Pokemon BDSP is a mixed bag. On one hand, the game looks good. On the other, it reverts back to problematic, out of date issues.

Pros
Game looks good
Access to Mythical Pokemon
Difficulty

Cons
Shiny Hunting
Time Clock
Based on Platinum version, but doesn’t contain all of Platinum’s features
Nothing New

I enjoyed BDSP. It looks bland, but it certainly looks better than many recent Pokemon games. And yes, I usually hate the chibi art style. I probably would have given Link’s Awakening a 9 and played it more than once if not for the chibi art style. It’s a little too cute for me to want to spend hours in it. But the Chibi art style doesn't bother me in this game--it doesn't feel like its crammed down my throat since the main action part of the game is in Pokemon battles.

The battles in BDSP feature Pokemon that utilize strategies used by competitive Pokemon players, which means that this game contained the most challenging and rewarding standard Pokemon battles. Pokemon contests make a return, allowing the player to train and use their Pokemon for something other than battling. The Underground is like a wannabe Wild Area, but also offers some mini games for players to participate in. To give the game more oomph, players who own other Pokemon games can obtain a Mew and Jirachi which are not catchable. Arceus, Shaymin, and Darkrai became available for a time as well so that was another plus. But I don’t think they’re available anymore, so that probably won’t affect the person reading this review.

The final pro of this game worth mentioning is the fact that it allows you to customize your Pokeball. You can’t change the exterior, but you can apply stickers to change the animation when your Pokemon comes out. There’s some worthwhile animations there.

People were disappointed that the game didn’t contain everything that Platinum offered, but that isn’t what bummed me out the most. What bummed me out the most is the shiny hunting. The game’s load times are longer than Sword/Shield’s. And the odds of finding a shiny Pokemon are 1 in 4000 even with the shiny charm. Yes, you can do Pokeradar (something I haven’t bothered with since it sounds really annoying how easy it is to break a streak), and they haven’t changed the Masuda method. But shiny hunting a legendary or through straight encounters will have a person hunting a long, long time. People who like hunting with full odds aren’t forced to increase their odds with the shiny charm. People who don’t like hunting with full odds are out of luck. Even though it is compatible with home now, it took almost a year for that to happen.

What has really irked me as of late is the Time Clock penalty. Change the time, and time related events (ones you have to do over and over again) don’t spawn for 24 hours irl. That’s what the rule says. However, I have waited for DAYS, and still there’s been no change. With some research, I’ve seen that the time penalty can take 24 IN-GAME hours to reset. That’s absurd. As far as remakes go, Skyward Sword HD gets a bad wrap, but it does a heck of a lot more to make the game more convenient (and consequently more immersive) than faithfully repeat the same mistakes and then some.

In summary of the cons, I don’t feel like BDSP respects a player’s time. My opinion is that the greatest appeal to the game is playing through the main story as its ai presents a greater challenge than other mainline Pokemon games I’ve played on the Switch. I liked it, but I can’t recommend it.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Kacek1996,20-08-2022,"Pokemon BDSP were the first ones I was like ""nah, I don't want to play it"", but then I realized my hunger for something new in my pokemon section of life.

Irorieh,10-12-2021,"A fun, if lazy game.

I've had a lot of fun playing this game, and I'd definitely consider it worth buying IF you are a fan of the series, but it's hard not to see the negatives. The confusing design really feels like a downgrade from even Shield and Sword which itself wasn't exactly the most stunning game on Switch. That said, going into this everyone knew what the game looked like, so it's not as though we were misled about the design, but still, they could have done a lot more.

In terms of things like in battle animations, not much has changed between SwSh, and this. Animations are the same as ever, for better or worse. It would be nice to see some effort put into these, to give different moves, abilities or reactions from different Pokémon a more unique appearance, although it's not as though I went into this expecting such. If nothing else, the game met my relatively low expectations.

The game has more than enough charm for me to enjoy it, but lacks anything that really defines the game among a series that has became increasingly (and disappointingly) known for its lacklustre releases.

1. Small issue here, but the fact that the game levels up pokemon without EVOLVING THEM is a joke. Your RIVAL has a level 20+ starly at one point and it's seriously disappointing.
2. There's no difficulty setting OR exp share toggle. That was the biggest mistake from SwSh and this game keeps it going. Also, it's painfully easy to overlevel because of the underground, BUT
3. The underground wild areas. Oh God, they're terrible. I do like the IDEA of an underground wild area, I think it's a genius idea. However, I don't think it could have been handled worse. The pokemon found in the underground are Hilariously overleveled so you don't even wanna add them to your team, there's no unique pokemon in the underground except for Houndoom (wow another fire type!), and best of all, there no real scaling. First of all, the levels go up exponentially with every gym, making grinding hariously easy. For another, the new HMs don't add any new dimension to the areas in meaningful ways. You can surf now, access 1 or 2 new items. Cool. Now imagine a cave with a strength puzzle with a rare candy atthe end, or a cave with cut trees to let you access a majority of it. Maybe rock smash to find pokemon in the rocks, or flying through the underground. The underground is poorly handled and even worsely experienced.

Dandy_,15-06-2022,"TLDR: Worse than the originals. Tons of missed potential. Overall worthless. Play Platinum.

I'm a massive gen 4 fan, and these games are worthless. Pokemon Diamond is by far the most important game of my childhood and the one I've made the most memories with. To be fair, I would've preferred something in the ORAS style (granted I still dont like those games) so it might not be fair to compare them to actual remakes, but I still want to mention how pathetic these games are. So, I'll try to judge these games as ""faithful remakes""

So in trying to stay faithful:
-They added the awful new friendship system which trivializes battles
-Said system also slows down battles
-HM system still way slower than should be (still useless text for Rock Smash, Cut, etc)
-Following Pokemon are back and still lag behind and are generally buggy
-Following Pokemon also make it hard to interact with ground items or HM blocks
-Actually REMOVED content from the Battle Tower (yes, from Platinum, but there was no reason to at least bring that back things that made those games objectively better)
-Subjective, but overall uglier than the originals. The translation to 3D using the chibi style from the originals did not land at all for me.
And of course, the use of those 3D models again for the Pokemon. Seeing new sprites back then was always a treat. Nowadays, it would be a **** blessing, but I'm going off track here.
-General lack of polish (which also slows down the game at times)

The biggest complain your hear about DP was the speed, and even here they couldn't get that right. The speed was the ONE thing they needed fix.

Reminder, these games are EASILY ACCESSIBLE through emulators. There is NO reason to play this over Platinum using literally any device you like through an emulator.
So for me, the decision to make these faithful remakes instead of something at least interesting like ORAS is crazy and yes, even with PLA coming out almost at the same time. At the very least, they could've remade Platinum and fixed the above. Just tons of missed potential over all, even as a low-effort """"""faithful"""""" remake.

EasyGamerBoi,04-12-2021,"These games (& Platinum) were such MASSIVE parts of my childhood that I still love Pokémon to this day, but that’s not to say they don’t try EXTREMELY hard to shake that love out of me with nearly every release this decade. These aren’t trainwrecks like Sword & Shield or LGPE, they’re quite literally the same games we played almost 20 years ago with a new coat of paint which is fine.. But to call these games remakes is a borderline insult, REMASTER is much more fitting but even then they really didn’t deliver in the way TPC has with the previous remakes. This is such a disappointment guys, my favorite Gen feels so.. hollow & soulless. The sad part is we all saw it coming since that abysmal reveal trailer back in February followed by a suspiciously long amount of radio silence on the game, what’s sadder is by being Gen 4 remasters they’re kinda the best Pokémon games to come out since the end of Gen 5 by default, remnants of a bygone era when TPC cared about their games. I can try to find positives.. if you liked Sinnoh then nothing changed, you’re still gonna love the region & all the Pokémon in it even though you’ll see the same ones 10 million times in the campaign. Things in Sinnoh don’t fully open up until the Post Game which is still one of the best in the series. The new OST is mostly good, a lot of hit or miss tracks thanks to a lower budget but the remixes that they got right, they KNOCKED out of the park (ex. Cynthia, Giratina, etc). Speaking of Cynthia, she’s as brutal as ever! I never had issues with her as a kid somehow (had a lot of trouble with Lucian instead) but this time she was on my NECK, I was genuinely shaking & sweating for my Pokémon’s lives. I literally can’t remember the last time I lost against an in-game trainer, it was EXHILARATING. For as heavily Pokémon uses nostalgia as a crutch for their stupid design choices, keeping everything the same here had me remembering things from playing these games in 2007 somehow! I would remember a different way to proceed through a route or a hidden item laying somewhere, all just coming to me naturally while exploring the world, I thought that was really neat. The graphics being at a smaller scale also look a lot better than they did in the sometimes hideous Sword & Shield. But for negatives we have a lot to unpack here. Firstly, this game is BUGGY as hell. It was very obviously rushed, the day 1 patch was over half the game but the level of bugginess is INEXCUSABLE from a billion dollar franchise like Pokémon. I’m talking over half the time you try to start the game from the Switch menu, you’ll get a “something went wrong” error & restart the very long wait time to get to the title screen, should I mention how many times this game has just randomly crashed in gameplay too? Despite an auto-save system, it can be wonky & not save for long stretches for some reason, leading to lost progress & anger. The chibi art style is lame too, I don’t care if that’s how it was in the original games, it was left in the past for a reason. It’s a bad sign when Cyrus is trying to destroy the universe & your immersion is shattered as it shows his tiny chibi model, expected to take any of this semi-seriously is impossible. Yes the game is still fun to play & I’d rather play it over the originals, but the general consensus around this game is that it should’ve been a PLATINUM remake, or at least have the enhancements brought by the Platinum re-release. This game is horribly unbalanced & retains so many of the asinine gameplay decisions that were weird & stupid even in 2006-7. BDSP REEKS of a lack of effort & passion, which is a blow to the gut for people like me who just watched their favorite Gen get the “who cares it’ll print money anyway” treatment that is indicative of every modern Pokémon release of the last 10 years, & I’d still defend Sun & Moon most days of the week! At this point I can’t be convinced otherwise that Pokémon is headed for a major crash, they’ll sell well regardless, but it will be tossed in with the likes of Call of Duty & other milked to the max franchises that even the developers don’t care about anymore, being crunched beyond what should be legal to deliver passionless projects year after year, & looking at Legends Arceus coming in the dump month of January… I doubt that can save it unless it completely reinvents the franchise, which we know Nintendo & TPC will probably never do until their wallets start to hurt. It’s a shame, compared to every remake we got from Pokémon before excluding LGPE, these remakes COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE like ORAS was, & we shouldn’t feel bad demanding more from a franchise that is comfortable doing less than the bare minimum.

FlexosuarousRex,20-02-2022,"My background as a pokemon player: I have been breeding and competitively battling since gen 5, crystal version, was my first ever pokemon experience, and gen 4 is my favorite era of pokemon bar none.

Pros: excellent music, fires on all nostalgic cylinders, HM fixes, legendary pokemon availability, first 4 gens of pokemon available, the underground improvements, faithful remake (may be a con depending on who you ask), mons follow you, excellent music, new clothing choices for protagonist, access to certain mythical pokemon, and this game actually retains a bit of the difficulty from the original titles which is something that I really appreciate.

Cons: The graphics aren't great, especially in docked mode, (currently) no connectivity to SS, no platinum content, no ranked competitive, no connection with SS (currently) means no using mons in any ranked format period, battle tower instead of battle frontier, the underground ""bases"" are literally just a messy set of statues and pedestals, and competitive teambuilding isn't necessary at all due to a lack of ranked gameplay.

Ultimately, the games aren't terrible. I genuinely had a good time going through the story and revisitng old routes and mons alike. If you have never experienced gen 4, this is a great way to check the games out. However, I really can only recommend this game to players who have not experienced gen 4 yet. For those of us that played through gen four multiple times on the DS and experienced platinum version, I would say your are better off revisiting the original titles. This game will offer connectivity with the other switch pokemon titles in the future and that in and of itself may be all the reason some players need in order to jump in, but honestly I would suggest sword and shield for those of us that don't care about completing the pokemon home pokedex, there is simply more to do in Sword and Shield and the game will certainly have a longer lifespan due its superior multiplayer options. If ranked gameplay is added to BDSP OR if all BDSP pokemon become available to use in competitive gameplay in sword and shield I will bump my score up a point and a half, but currently I feel that the game does deserve a 7, not lower and not higher.

I'm not trying to take away anyone's enjoyment of these titles because, like I said in the beginning, I did enjoy going through the story again and there is certainly fun to be had with diamond and pearl. However, after all of the dust settles, the fact of the matter is that these games have less content than a DS game did when it launched back in 2008.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
PMG-Writer,28-12-2021,"Nintendo managed two successful remakes for fans and children with Pokémon Radiant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl. The storyline is neat and drives us through the game. Thanks to the simple gameplay concept, both games are just fun to play and it motivates enormously to experience the familiar story and catch and train Pokémon. The graphical presentation and the background music are successful and round off the good overall impression. Still, there are a few weak scenes in the remakes. Those who would like to play with Pokémons again should take a closer look for ""Pokémon Brilliant Diamond"" and ""Pokémon Shining Pearl"".",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
MasterV777,21-03-2022,"By far one of the most disappointing parts of this game was the day 1 patch. While most of the day 1 patches in games just fix some things, BDSP's day 1 patched in most of the game, including the opening cinematic, closing cinematic, post game, and soundtrack etc. Without the day 1 patch, instead of the new soundtrack, you get these placeholder sounds. This means without the day 1 patch, the original diamond and pearl are better than these games, which is unacceptable for a Pokémon remake.

sunny_rip,05-02-2022,"This is a decent game in the series, it's not stunning and jaw dropping, but it's a fun time that many Pokemon Fans will enjoy

Pros:
-Really charming art style and pretty nice graphics, with some really nice looking battle backgrounds and great looking environments.
-Uses the expanded Pokémon Platinum Dex, which has much more Pokémon for the player to use.
-The Underground was upgraded very well with the Grand Underground, and Pokémon Hideaways are super fun to explore.
-You don't need to use HMs on your team members, instead Wild Pokémon will use them for you when you need to by being selected on the Poketch.

Cons:
-TMs are breakable
-Post Game content can be a bit underwhelming, and the lack of a Battle Frontier is pretty sad.
-It's a bit easier for my liking, but you can make it more difficult by using set battle style, no healing items, etc.
-Exp. Share is mandatory
-No Battle Frontier
-Minimal Post Game Content

PixelatedOdyssy,07-12-2021,"I love this game, I grew up playing the original on the DS and this hits the nostalgia hard. Putting that aside, these are still good games.
Are they perfect? no
Are they fun and true to the original? yes

the good: I feel like most of the people giving bad reviews expected as drastic of a change as we saw with sword and shield, which this game was never supposed to be. It has tons of extra pre and post game content, quality of life changes, and everything you loved from the originals. This game was not marketed as or meant to be something more than a remake that's faithful to the original. There are new legendries, extra battles, easier shiny hunting, the new XP sharing system, and the game is more challenging than the originals at a lot of points. Basically if you like pokemon or liked the original games you will like this game.

the bad: the price, $60 or $120 for both, is steep. I think $30 would be a much more fair price for one game. There were people who experienced soft locks and bugs, I was not one of those people. Since the 1.1.2 patch, all of those issues have been fixed. I know a lot of people wish they could turn off the new leveling system, I think that should be an option as well, but I also don't mind the XP sharing system. They added a penalty for time skips, so if you change your clock time manually then all timed events (trees, berries, timed pokemon, etc) will freeze for 24 hours. I hate this penalty, as they kept in the annoying timed events like trees taking six hour to find pokemon and berries taking hours of time to grow; they should've found a middle ground. They kept the original battle tower and shop, I think this is bad because the grind to level up pokemon post game takes a long time - I like how easy it was in sword to get XP or rare candies to level up and try new teams, this is a quality of life thing that should've been added. I also think they should've kept the sword and shield shiny hunting and IV hunting methods, the new additions are good, but not preferred imo.

the mixed: some people complain that there are glitches you can exploit to duplicate pokemon and items, I personally think these are fun and since they only effect your offline play that they do not hinder the game or other people at all. There are also glitches that let you get timed event pokemon early, since this only effects offline play, I don't see it as an issue and it lets you play the game at your own pace. The post game grind feels like its too much, in order to get legendries you need to do a lot of tedious farming, this could've been optimized better.

Overall. the games are what they were marketed to be, a new coat of paint with a few quality of life features added. This game is far better, especially after the patch, (although its annoying they didn't fix the issues beforehand) than the user score suggests. Its worth playing.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Aeri,13-12-2021,"I played many, many, many hours on my original Pearl and many within Platinum. The Gen IV games were my absolute favorites and felt a great loss when I lost my carts. So when I heard of the BD/SP remakes I was absolutely thrilled.

I loved how they've done this game and I will regale you with my favorite bits and WHY I love them so much.

Grand Underground: My god, I've pretty sure most of my gametime has been spent down there. They did away with the bits which I found tiresome (""Growing"" of orbs, Orbs having a multitude of levels and being eaten up with no change) and made it more streamlined with purpose. I do personally miss old secret bases, but the new ones having a purpose with statues is a worthy trade off and one I can get behind.

The Graphics: Ok, unpopular opinion here, I enjoyed the graphics. The overworld ""Cutesy"" Sprites harken back to what we had, whilst trying to make a middle ground with the Switch's capabilities. I would've personally preferred the SW/SH graphics we got within the battles on the overworld, but I also doubt they would've worked too well with the layout of the game, I see no reason here to hate.

Pokédex: Another unpopular opinion. Thank god they stuck to JUST the original dex's from the period. I find it ridiculous people expected to get anything beyond Gen IV in this game when it was announced many moons ago we'd never see a ""Full national dex"", it was on the cards this is how it'd be. I can only really say ""Go cry into your cereal some more"".

There's so much more I want to go into, but I also feel these are the key points. I will also be curious as to whether all remasters will be handled by this ""new"" company from now on, allowing GameFreak to bring out new and varied Pokémon experiences which will be better, this is something noone seems to be talking about.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

I had to spam some XP in the ocean and cave prior to actually beating the Elite 4, (I will admit, I am not a ""Gotta Catch Em' All"" player as I hate the random encounter system, which is thankfully no more come Gen 9.)

AldoBaran,27-01-2022,"This game is a pretty good representation of its original version of 2006. When a Pokémon game is launched expectations are very high, however in this specific situation the marketing campaign did what he had to do: it represented a game that wanted to be nothing more and nothing less than the game of 2006. The graphic rendering is rewarding and clean and, in my personal opinion, represents a plus that must necessarily contextualized in a chibi style of NPC. Therefore I believe that despite this chibi style is not completely elegant, I think that the overall view it is pleasant. Do I recommend to play this game? My answer is yes if you want to relive a somewhat nostalgic experience. My answer is yes if you want to see why this brand is so successful (as it contains all the strengths of Pokémon games). Grand underground: necessary but at the same time annoying. Compared to Swsh raids this part of the game becomes obsolete very quickly. For the same reason I do not recommend the game for its ""online part"". Overall, therefore, ILCA needed to ""pull the trigger"" for those elements in the post game and for those elements that needed to be modified compared to 2006 (online is the best example). On the other hand the game is satisfactory. The initial selling price does not, however, represent its true value.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The Grand Underground is a great addition to the game, and while unfortunate that secret base customization is limited to placing statues to affect Pokémon spawn rates, it's more than made up for by being able to catch so every non-Sinnoh native Pokémon in the Grand Underground, except for the aforementioned Mythical Pokémon not included in events in Sinnoh. It's a shame that it doesn't include the Platinum version of the Battle Frontier and only includes the Battle Tower found in the original Diamond and Pearl.

Okay but to give credit to the developers (who are quite Briallient and Shining) they did include a way to caputer the mythical pokemon keldo. Now why does this matter, you may ask> Keldo hasm't been relevent since Gold and Silver! Alas my young reader, you have yet to learn the trye Brillantence of The pokemon Diamnd Shining develeopers.

Aloowe me to begin with the positives of this game. Number 1. The graphics are **** terrible. They're on par with the bad tree game and make me smell really BAD

Number 2. The problems.
Problem number 0.5/ The game lackes a way to obtain a furrent in the main story wihtout trading which means A. you need money ( you don't have any because you bought this game ) or B. you need friends ( you don't have any because you bought this game )

ALl in all though, i'd say this is a worthwhile experience for the average pokemon fan enduring the time on the swithc.

ezo2002,19-02-2022,"Everything is slow, they excluded tons of platinum pokemon to make the game ""feel like diamond and pearl you love"" yet quality of life stuff, fairy types and how they let you access absol, houndoom and rhydon fairly early as if it were a modern gen 8 game. It can't decide whether it's excruciatingly faithful to the originals, as they retain the slowness and limited dex of those games, or an adaptation into the gen 8 style, one already prone to serious flaws in its standard game design, what with glitches, broken leveling system (that you cannot deactivate), and bumps in the road through its graphics all as a backdrop to a roster that is limited yet offer some evolved and wickedly high-leveled pokemon early on, after maybe an HOUR in the underground. I didn't know a gen 8 game would have to choose between frustrating and easy, yet I suppose it is on-brand for it to fumble the bag hard and devolve into a mindless, structure-less husk. After I beat the game I somehow managed to feel contempt for the original Sinnoh games, sadly, because despite their slowness, their I always came back to the story, the gyms and the pokemon whenever I reflected on their positives, which were pretty damn strong positives at that. The details of each gym leader's team, the sight of pokemon like gliscor and mamoswine, empoleon, carnivine, croagunk, bronzong and many others for the first time all for the first time, both were unforgettable and brought a genuine smile to my face. Evolutions were fun to complete, the pokedex was reasonably long, Cyrus gave the villain motivation with only maybe just an ounce of more grit and realism, but it was just fun to read his dialogue, the villain team too. This game took all of that, took the charm, took the fun and melted it into a thin laminate then stretched it to the point where it would just about give out over a white, soulless, dense and brittle brick of cement labeled formula then cut it down, stuck some wires into it and marketed it as a remake. I recently revisited pokemon platinum on my DS during a playthrough of White 2 and looked up palmer's fight and found myself floored. It was exciting, it looked fun, the music was catchy and upbeat and Palmer's animation, even if it was a couple of frames, it was emotive and pumped me up as it moved with the music. There was so much character in it too, I felt like Palmer was this extreme, energetic guy that also happened to father Barry. It was entertaining to watch and when I would go through it and the battle factory myself, I had the exact same experience, but a whole lot more excited since I was actually the one playing the battle this time. Yet BDSP reduces that experience to a mere single strand of 21 slow trainer battles and a looped close-up of a chibi animation that would transition to a stagnant frame of palmer standing there, his team feeling basically lifeless. I just don't get it. I understand the limitations of a COVID-era-production process, but it is easy to look at how well Fire Red and Leaf Green and Heart Gold and Soul Silver fared. Both were faithful to their games, sure, but you look to Fire Red and Leaf Green, more pokemon are available, biking is easier, Charmander had metal claw for the first gym, all starters received larger move pools, event pokemon and Sevii islands were easy to note from the start of the game and provided just a touch more incentive to complete the game and play out the post-game, link trading required fewer cables, TMs changed, trainer pokemon updated to gen 3 standards and the rematch with Gary included Tyranitar and Heracross on the team. Later on, came Heart Gold and Soul Silver, which kept Swinub and Tangela and Yanma for Sinnoh evolutions, remixed every single theme in the game, made several Hoenn and Sinnoh pokemon available, albeit through access to evolution items or late-game areas, to keep johto pokemon at the core of its gen 4 stylings. They implemented gen 4's physical-special split and updated practically every single johto pokemon's move set and learn set to encourage variety and allowed you to teach gen 4 tms like shadow claw and steel wing to your teammates that could learn it. Pokemon sprites were better looking and ALSO had the same animation as gym leaders, league champions and important trainers. Suicune had more of a story, as did the Kanto section. Both saw developers takes on the task of modernizing and re-energizing their games for a new gen and more powerful console, yet kept the pokemon, gameplay, and plot progression the same, if not more interesting. Even ORAS got that part right, Gen 6's emphasis on ease dried up the gameplay on occasion. Gen 8 meanwhile kept this ease and quality-of-life changes, Pokedex should still be bigger, the graphics better, and low difficulty was hit or miss. Yet saves, exp, and the menu was ultimately all that came of it. Like its secret base system, this game still feels empty for what it adds and should remain deep underground.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Lewisbwh,03-03-2022,"It is hard for me to give this a 1, 2 or a 3 as this is literally Pokemon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum for the Nintendo DS on the Switch. The original games released in 2006 and while having flaws (such as being slow) were all around very good games. They added Online Multiplayer to Pokemon which we take for granted nowadays, graphically they were a big upgrade from Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald. They were decently challenging, but not too hard so that a child could not enjoy them. They also added brilliant new Pokemon such as Lucario, characters like Cynthia and the Sinnoh Region is great.

These games are the same games but worse. If I give DPP a 7 then I can at most give BDSP a 5. The Chibi Art style is not a 'creative direction' or whatever, it is just laziness. It is jarring and strange. They also made the game substantially easier due to the 'Friendship' mechanic where your Pokemon can just one-hit KO an opponent if it loves you enough, I guess? This is ridiculous as you are more than likely going to be using the same Pokemon for the majority of the game (mine was Infernape, Staraptor, Luxray, Floatzel, Garchomp and Lucario, the first four I had for the majority of the game). This means that essentially every Pokemon in your party gains this special affect. There is no way to turn this off. Nice. The only battle which was decently challenging was the Cynthia battle but even then, I did not black out once in this game. There are also plenty of bugs which can be triggered easily, this is not really bad on it's own as you have to go out of your way to trigger them, however I think it shows how rushed these games were.

RandomNutmeg,19-04-2022,"Honestly, mediocre at best. Tons of glitches and the following pokemon are a let down (especially compared to what Let's Go Pikachu/Eevee gave us.) I think overall it was a glow up for the original games, however it's a huge let down that there will be no Platinum version, and that the remake suffers from the problems that led to the original Diamond and Pearl getting a third version. Though I didn't mind the chibi style graphics, I don't want to see them become standard moving on. I would be extremely disappointed to see a Black and White version remake with these graphics, as there would be a huge loss to the more serious tone and themes of those games.

It was basically a carbon copy of the original Diamond with a weird hybrid of Pokémon’s modern artstyle and a chibi artstyle that... is a little odd. There’s nothing from Platinum in the game outside of a few minor things like the early purchase outfits, and given that Platinum was the definitive Sinnoh game... that just means it’s a downgrade of an existing game. Every other remake added to itself in some way - new Pokémon from the generations that had come out after the original set of games, new features, content from or homaging the third, enhanced version of the games... BDSP falls flat on its face on delivering new features. Just go buy Legends Arceus instead for the true Sinnoh remake.",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC

RensR,30-01-2022,"Disclaimer: If you care a lot about graphics and not gameplay, this isn’t the game for you. Giving the game a 3 just because the graphics are lacking is shallow.

I have been playing Pokemon since Diamond and Pearl on the DS, and this is the most fun I’ve had with a Pokemon game since. This is mostly due to the well structured gameplay loop. There are lots of ways you can approach battling and catching Pokemon, and this freedom really defines the entire game. Instead of pressing a button to run away from a battle, you can just actually run away. You can move during a battle giving you any perspective you’d like. Once you get past the tutorial, you are free to explore a large area with lots of danger and excitement. Besides that, every mechanic implemented is streamlined to perfection. The gameplay is a much needed and revolutionary step in the Pokemon franchise. The gameplay earned itself a 10/10.

A valid point of critique is that the graphics are lacking. Don’t get me wrong, there are some moments where the game looked pretty, but overall it’s very very mediocre. The textures are often compared to the Wii era, and let me tell you, they’re not far off. Furthermore, there is the usual pop-in of trees and rocks which isn’t always noticeable, but is very jarring when you do notice it. Luckily the Pokemon themselves do not pop in as heavily, they are usually seen from further away at the expense of a lower frame rate. The pop in has been improved from earlier titles like Pokemon Sword and Shield. Overall the graphics leave a lot to be desired. Though it does add enough to game overall, therefore I rate this department a 6/10.

I was pleasantly surprised by the sound design in the game, though I didn’t expect anything else from the GameFreak veteran Go Ichinose. The soundscapes in Legends Arceus take the immersion to a new level for the series. The world of Pokemon has never felt more alive. My favorite sounds are those of the player movement. Rolling, sprinting, crouching in the grass, throwing a pokeball. I am a massive fan of this amount of detail. The soundtracks in the game are subtle, and reminds one of Zelda Breath of the Wild. There are some beautiful renditions in there of older soundtracks of the Sinnoh region, one of my favorite being Jubilife Village. The games sound earned itself a 10/10.

People asked for better animations, and they got it. There are a lot of new animations for the Pokemon themselves, the moves, the NPCs and much more. GameFreak outdid themselves in this department. It’s really the little things that sold me on the animations. Pokemon actually make eye contact, the trainer can be seen showing actual emotions. After a heavy battle, the player often wipes off some sweat. The player can get hit by a Pokemon’s moves and you can see the player retreat a Pokemon to their pokeball. Sure, they’re small things but it’s never seen before in the Pokemon franchise, a recurring theme in Pokemon Legends Arceus. There are some moments where GameFreak could’ve done more, or better said; at least something. The game still fades to black in cutscenes where two characters are supposed to interact with each other, which just comes across as lazy. It’s an easy technique to avoid animating something, and for real time events that’s acceptable. However, we are talking about cutscenes here. GameFreak’s cutscenes are outdated, and it’s sad they didn’t improve them for this game. There are lots of things to love in the animation department, but it’s not perfect. Therefore the animations are a 9/10 for me.

To conclude, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a game worth your time. Whether you are new to the franchise or a veteran. Everything combined, this game is a 9/10.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Mooynz,29-01-2022,"I really liked it, it may not be a graphic masterpiece but it's a lot of fun, the changes are positive, and because they are positive, they tend to stay and be improved in the future. Do not take seriously the opinion of those who have not played and simply say that it is not worth it because of the graphics (you can be sure that if someone said that the game is not good because of the graphics that person did not play). Go play and see how fun the game is

It's an important step for franchising. They've been trying to evolve a 25 year series and they're on the right track, thinking so Pokemon Legends Arceus can almost be called a successful draft. I highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the franchise, who doesn't play pokemon and doesn't have the weight of nostalgia probably won't be enchanted by the game.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

This is very fun! You have to be careful not just with the one you are aprouching to but with the environment around you and the other creatures that are on it. The art style of the menus, the one where you select the pokemón you witch to be the first choice on your party, to be always at your disposal, the new físicas pokedéx with all his missions by pokemón already mentioned, the overal layouts and the art choices are very good and create that feeling of being on the medieval era in a very good way.

Leeham121,29-01-2022,"Are graphics good? In terms of landscape, no they are about as basic as it gets nowadays, not necessarily bad just subpar and I have seen the lowered framerate that the Pokémon get have when you get a certain distance from them.

In terms of actual gameplay itself though, I really enjoyed it, the core loop of finding Pokémon and doing different task in order to get more research point is enjoyable. You sort of just get lost in the exploring and finding Pokémon only to find yourself at one of the corners of the area and you probably still missed a few things on the way.

Sturmfall,30-01-2022,"This is, finally, a very solid entry in a franchise that has been stagnating for the last half a decade (being very generous). After SwSh, which was easily my least favorite Pkmn game of all time, and BDSP, which was, to me, an extremely pointless retread of an old game with very little in the way of anything new or compelling to offer, I was extremely skeptical and pretty convinced this game would end up being a mess. But, my curiosity ended up getting the better of me and I really have to say, I've been pretty thoroughly won over here. Ultimately it comes to the gameplay actually being quite compelling this time around, and it all comes down to the fact this game actually requires some thought on the part of the player. It's not terribly difficult/unforgiving or anything, but it isn't mindlessly easy either. You might actually need to think about type match ups, or what moves to teach your Pokemon, there might even be a bit of planning, resource management, and strategy at play here--in a Pokemon game! Imagine that, huh? Anyway I have no real massive complaints on the game itself, its quite fun, and not in the mindless, check a bunch of things off a list sort of way (even though there definitely is some that here). The only big shortcoming here is the visuals. I have never cared much about graphics, but I unfortunately have to say the game looks awful. Gamefreak needs more staff in their visual department and that's all there is to it. It isn't actively detrimental to the game in my opinion, but it's definitely going to both some people more than others, so be aware.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

I am not giving it a 10 because I feel there were alot of things they could do with the graphics, goddammit it just needs a bit of polishing, maybe some more cool minigames, different mysteries and wuests that You can randomly find in the wild, that would be amazing.

However i also found some strange things that made me a little confused: As i've already said, the graphics are not THAT good, but this is not a big deal for me.

undeadmuffin00,29-01-2022,"This has got to be the most fun I have had with a Pokemon game in many, many years. Here is some background for anyone who cares. I got Pokemon Yellow after I played a little of Red my cousin loaned me. I loved it and played though it 3 times. I was young and stupid and had erased the game by mistake a few times because I wanted to experience the beginning of the game. I played a little of Silver before my friend wanted his copy back. When Diamond and Pearl came out on the DS I got back in the series after I had taken time away from it for a while. I Enjoyed Pearl and had completed the game in a week and played it for a few more. Then I tried playing the games that came after. I played through Black and had some fun. I couldn’t even get myself to finish Black 2. I played and beat Y over a weekend and didn’t touch it again. Sun was boring and I never finished, Let’s Go Pikachu, it was fun but couldn’t hold my old man attention. I gave up on Sword because it was a massive let down and after being someone who started playing the series in 2000 I was just kinda done with the repetitiveness of the franchise. So when I say it’s the most fun I have had with a Pokemon game in a long time, it’s not for lack of trying. Even though I never touch Y after that weekend, I always intended to return to it. Because I enjoyed it… At any rate this isn’t a franchise review it’s a review of the new game. A game that is has me thinking about it when I’m not playing it. A game that got me to roll out of bed on the eve of my 35th birthday and toss loads of hours into it and talk endlessly to my wife about it when I wasn’t playing. The only reason I won’t rate this game over an 8 is there are still problems with it. These problems don’t mean I don’t love the, because I do. It relaxes my mind in it’s repetition, it also frustrates me with that very repetitive nature. The fact that I have spent hours working with one Pokemon and still haven’t completed it’s dex entry highlights a massive shortcoming with the game. Most things need to be repeated 20 to 25 times and that’s a bit excessive in my book. As much as I love this game I'm not sure I’ll ever finish a single Dex entry. Also the story, while good, feels like it’s bulked out by characters repeating the same few story points over and over. To a point that when it happens I just kinda skip the dialogue until something new is being said. I don’t need to read where I have come from and what I did 6 hours ago over and over ad nauseam. On that the tutorial in this game is horribly long and handholding. Then we get to the graphics… oh boy, the graphics… I honestly don’t care. They look fine for the most part. Sure there is a bit of clipping here and there. Water and grass can look a bit outdated, but I really, really don’t care. I often find it beautiful to look at and while I think they could have done better or perhaps hid the graphics behind cell shading like BotW did I’m fine with them. I enjoy the game and at the end of the day that is what I’m looking for in a video game: enjoyment. I have played way too many games with stunning visuals and no substance whatsoever. I have played games with awesome stories but horrible controls that force me to stop. I just want fun and I find this game very fun, even when it’sa bit tedious.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Explorar el mundo es un deleite, tanto por los colores, la hermosa vegetación, y la cantidad apabullante de pokémon que interactúan y EXISTEN dentro del entorno, tal cual como lo haría un animal en la vida real.

El sistema de combate ha sido simplificado, pero de manera concienzuda para ser mas difícil respecto al reto de pokémon mas salvajes, algo que en toda la saga ha sido demasiado fácil.

La progresión, las misiones, todo te hace experimentar cosas nuevas, y los personajes están hechos con mucho mimo.
Yo recomendaría no quedarse solo con los gráficos, este juego es mucho mas que eso, y los que de verdad aprecian Pokémon, y comprendan sus tradiciones, gozaran como unos críos.
La opinion mas correcta es celebrar este titulo como algo grande.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
GregoFMP,29-01-2022,"Los graficos son un desastre, y el tutorial es largo y tedioso. Y hasta ahi van los puntos malos, es el mejor pokémon en muchisimos años, el nuevo gameplay es muy divertido, el mundo abierto es basicamente lo que tendría que haber sido el wild area en Espada/Escudo. Explorar las diferentes areas resulta muy divertido y el juego te recompensa por ello.
Yo entiendo que no te pueda gustar, pero el nivel de hate que esta recibiendo por algunos personajes es completamente injustificado, gente que le da un 1 porque un juego que no pensaban jugar tiene malos gráficos. Esa misma gente que esta bajando el puntaje del usuario de Metacritic, que le molesta que los demas disfruten un juego.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The battle mechanics are great and the fact that some wild Pokémon are out for your blood as soon as they see you is both hilarious and terrifying.

DaPlant,29-01-2022,"Pokémon Legends: Arceus manages to re-work the stale formula of the mainline Pokémon series which hasn't been well received in nearly two decades. The game finds a way to blend more Pokémon Go-esc mechanics with the traditional Pokémon battle system almost seamlessly into open environments to the point where I never got tired of trying to catch everything I could find.

Unfortunately, the game does have to make some sacrifices to allow for its likely short development time due to the Pokémon Company's eagerness to get games out quickly. This is most apparent when judging the game from a graphical perspective which, for a game that feels like it should like nice due to its attempts at BOTW-esc environments, it absolutely fails... look at it more as if BOTW were for the Wii (although do keep in mind that footage of the game likely looks far worse than the game itself since for example Youtube compression hardcore messes up the grass) . Additionally, there are only about 240 or so Pokémon which is seems a little disappointing but considering they actually gave them new animations and worked them into the game's world that much more would just feel impossible to implement in only a few years.

Regardless of its flaws, the game still comes out to be a ton of fun with its new gameplay loop and intriguing story and still earns a high rating in my book.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Stoin,30-01-2022,"The game is not perfect by far, for me mainly the graphics are the greatest point of disappointment. If only they would have taken a little longer to polish it out but alas. I can look over it however since I think the game is the best and funniest Pokémon game since the Nintendo DS days. It's also the first game in a long time that I can truly play for hours on end, Day after day. Hatching a plan to sneak up to a strong Pokémon you don't really want to fight but still catch and seeing that plan work out is the best thing ever. And even when you fail there is still something to learn from that failure to apply the next time. The AI and wild Pokémon also feel stronger then other games, which for me is a huge plus. Makes you really think about what team you're gonna bring when going into the wild.

sofaspartan,31-01-2022,"While it’s graphics can leave a lot to be desired, Pokémon Legends: Arceus’s gameplay has been retooled for a much more smooth and engaging experience. Moving away from the traditional rpg format, the game feels more like a modern open-world game akin to Breath of the Wild. I feel that this game represents a significant leap for Pokémon as a whole, drawing us closer to the Pokémon game that we’ve always dreamed of. The game is not without its graphical issues, however they aren’t significant enough to hamper the gameplay. Overall I would certainly recommend this game to those looking for an open-world Pokémon experience.

Things I Like:
• Open World
• Catching and battling Pokémon on-the-fly
• Battles occur in the environment, not in arenas

Things I Don’t Like:
• Unfinished feeling to the graphics with low quality textures and aggressive pop-in,
• Star progression can feel like a grind at times",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Zski,29-01-2022,"This was a necessary experiment for the Pokémon franchise, and it was executed fairly well. Most importantly, I think it laid a solid foundation for future sequels that will build on the formula. The game focuses entirely on the single player experience, which is where it differs the most from other games in the series. So there is no battling other human players, and minimal interaction with others, and this is entirely by design. The game serves as a prequel to the Pokémon franchise, so the areas you explore are very empty due to them being underdeveloped. This definitely gives the series a long desired sense of exploration and adventure. I’m not a huge fan of Pokémon games, I played several of them, but skipped out on others if I just wasn’t in the mood. That formula has not changed in 25 years, so this a very welcome change of pace, while still keeping the core spirit of the Pokémon universe. The gameplay loop feels much like (early) Pokémon Go, where the main objective is just to explore and catch all of the Pokémon. It’s a pleasant game to explore, however the gameplay loop does get a little repetitive so I found myself taking a lot of breaks, but I would I regularly return to it. It has that Breath of the Wild atmosphere which is very relaxing - minimal music in the wild, only ambient nature noises, the music is all very soft piano, and vast open spaces. I also appreciate that they added some substance to the story, granted it’s nothing to go crazy about, but it provides a welcome change of pace to “beat all the gym leaders and get their badges to become the best” that we have been provided for the past 25 years. The graphics aren’t as bad as people make them out to be, but they definitely aren’t impressive. I almost feel like if they weren’t able to do high quality graphics, whether it’s cartoon or realistic, the game would have looked better with some degree of artistic design - maybe watercolor impressions, or anything really, because the graphics do damper the sense of exploration a little bit. Overall it’s a fun game I can see myself taking my time to play through because it’s just a relaxing experience. Everything is solid, the effort is exceptional, but it laid that groundwork for future sequels which can truly be fantastic games. I can definitely tell you this is far more exciting than any possible new generation of Pokémon they could introduce, and probably one of the most memorable Pokémon experiences in the last 15 years.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
mepphy,29-01-2022,"The game is not perfect but as a starting pokèmon game which tries to be more open man does its good work.

SneedOil,29-01-2022,"Fun game. Didn't blow my mind, but it definitely laid the groundwork for a future game that could. It doesn't surpass the experience I had playing the gen 1-3 games as a kid, but the shake-ups to the formula were, for me, just enough for the series to feel fun again for the first time in over a decade.

The game's visuals seem to be the most common complaint but I don't really see it. Gamefreak have never exactly been masters of aesthetic quality and I'm fine with that. But it looks passable to me, sometimes even pleasant. Roaming around the village the first couple hours reminded me a bit of the Utawarerumono series. The main zones did start to become pretty drab after a while but they didn't make a poor first impression on me. Terrain textures don't matter to me, they could have made them flat colors for all I care. The mesh LOD pop-in is a much bigger problem.

The big things I liked about the game:
-The main gameplay loop is fun. Going out of my way to fill out the pokedex and earn new stars never got boring to me.
-As someone who likes JRPGs but is tired of encounters random or otherwise, this new approach to pokemon battles feels nice. Starting and ending battles feels seamless, and if a battle isn't going my way I can quite literally just turn around and walk away. Love it.
-The effort level system, while it's not without drawbacks, makes the game more challenging. The EV system from the mainline pokemon games rewards you just for sticking with a pokemon long term by effectively giving them massive stat modifiers. In this game my main never felt invincible until I went out of my way to max out their ELs. Though it does feel kinda gamey compared to EVs, especially the process of levelling them. But it's just nice to actually be able to see the numbers now.
-Each pokemon has an inventory of moves now, and you can swap them in and out of the four in use whenever you want. I like this a lot better than the way it works in the mainline games.
-There's an item that lets you evolve pokemon you would otherwise need to trade to evolve. As a guy who never really cared for the trading thing, I appreciated this a lot.
-Mounts are very cool (but some more than others)

All my big problems with this game, most of which are quality of life related:
-You can't switch between zones without returning to the hub area first. And you can't just return to the village at will either, you have to get back to a camp first and talk to the scientist guy with his goofy hat first every single time. And when you need to go somewhere in the village for something, you can't just leave the second your business is complete, you have to walk or fast travel to the gate first. This started to get really annoying after the first few hours. It would be so much better if they let you jump between zones freely from the map.
-The village is so slow to get around that it's usually faster to open the map and fast travel to the building across the street than it is to just walk there. All the areas where you don't have access to mounts feel annoyingly spacious in general
-The pokebox (well, this game's equivalent) quickly becomes an eyesore. You have to talk to specific NPCs to access it, and there is no meaningful option to automatically sort or filter it. For this game in particular, this is a big problem. Between the ability to seamlessly throw pokeballs at wandering pokemon without encounters, the new pokedex research system and the new effort level system, you are encouraged to catch every pokemon you lay eyes on. But as for actually sorting through all those pokemon you catch, this game makes that process no less laborious than it would be in one of the 20 year old Pokemon games. That sucks. A lot.
-There's no option to skip most cutscenes. The 'cinematic' moments you're free to skip, but the boring conversations you have 5 times each throughout the game you have to slowly click through each line of uninteresting dialogue.
-No option to shorten or disable combat animations
-The main boss fights for each zone are pretty lame. Not because the bosses themselves are uncool, but because the player's role in the fight is to chuck 100 bean bags at them.
-The mounts vary in quality. They're more or less this game's answer to the Bicycle and traversal HMs from previous games. The deer is pretty great. The Surf mount is awesome and for sure a highlight of the game. The rest though are just lame. I expected the flying one to completely change how I interacted with the zones I'd been exploring up to that point; because it can fly, right? That should be awesome, like an aircraft in a GTA clone that you can pull out of your pocket. But no, it's just a glider pretty much. I mean gliders aren't so bad, but, cmon man. That was a massive letdown after how cool the fish was.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Kickababy,29-01-2022,"The best Pokemon game in years. Completely tears up the rules surrounding what a Pokemon game has to be and delivers a fresh, more logical take on the series. The story actually feels like some effort was put in, and the interactions with NPCs are ACTUALLY ENJOYABLE.
This universe is so much more engaging, as people act like real people confronted with these terrifying creatures known as Pokemon. It actually feels like there's a point to working on the Pokedex as you educate people around the region on what Pokemon are. (this Sudowoodo is sad, but it's a plant so maybe spraying it with water pulse will help! lol)
The battle system is vastly improved as well. Popping into a battle is much faster than in S&S or D&P to the point that bet if you play this and then go back to either of those it's the first thing you notice. Also, ability to move around in battle means during quick battles you can choose your attack and then start running before the battle even ends. It's so much fresher.
Catching Pokemon is faster too, as you can catch them the normal way (unless they run, which happens a lot) or you can sneak around and stealth his them with a ball like the survivalist Pokemon trainer you are. The Pokemon GO influence here works great imo. It makes you feel like Pokemon are actually these wild creatures with habitats and temperaments.
Finally, just a small thing, but I like how you can always run from a battle. It never made sense that you couldn't in previous games outside ""these are the rules of Pokemon games."" In Arceus, you just call you Pokemon back and run tf away which is much more realistic. Which sort of encapsulates what I like so much about this game, things just make way more sense within the context of Pokemon existing.

I love it and beg Nintendo to please make more. This game is VERY different from previous games though, so that may bother you (although if you're one of those people who like to meme about Pokemon making the same game year after year, I hope this doesn't bother you)

Cons: The art is really pretty, but looks like **** on the big screen. So -1 just for basically Nintendo hardware holding back what would undoubtedly be a better game if it was allowed to spread its wings.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Calomaro,03-02-2022,"He visto las críticas negativas de otros usuarios y si bien comparto algunos aspectos criticables, como lo son los gráficos, hay otros que son totalmente disparatados. Si tú, que aún no compras el juego, lees una de esas críticas negativas donde consideran a Pokemon Sword & Shield mejor que este juego, no te puedes tomar para nada en serio esa crítica. Pokemon Sword & Shield es una oda al facilismo, insultantemente fácil, una de las peores entregas de la saga Pokemon y que hizo que la Nintendo Switch esté en deuda con los fans.

Habiendo aclarado esto, el Pokemon Arceus empieza lento por un tutorial tan extenso que nos puede tomar hasta 3 horas completar. Superado el tutorial, y conociendo las mecánicas el juego, siento que se vuelve adictivo, no solo por completar la pokedex, sino también para completar las misiones secundarias. Se vuelve repetitivo en un momento? SÍ, pero ¿qué juego de pokemon no es repetitivo? Aquí lo importante es qué tanto te dura la diversión hasta que se torne repetitivo. Personalmente me gusta el farmeo y soy seguidor antiguo de la saga. El juego a veces peca de mucho texto y el hecho que no haya voces aún es algo imperdonable en la época en la que vivimos.

Nintendo ha dado un paso pequeño, pero un paso al fin. Para mucho este juego puede ser una beta para algo grande. Yo lo estoy disfrutando, y esperaré una futura entrega con todas las mejoras necesarias para que un juego de pokemon aspire a ser lo que realmente los fans queremos.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
awimax,31-01-2022,"This game is a huge leap for its franchise and just a fun and good Pokémon game.

You start with a good and deservedly long tutorial.
If you are a long die-hard fan of the Pokémon franchise, you immediately notice the fundamental changes that were made. You actually get a good introduction into the new movement and the catching system. If you are someone that is in some way unbiased and pick up the game because it looks interesting, it is just as good. Unlike many Pokémon games before this (e.g. Sword & Shield), this game actually has depth and story that I would let adults enjoy. It's a world in which Pokémon are wild, people are afraid of them and don't even dare to touch them. If you do not come prepared or act rashly, you can very well lose your life from an NPC's standpoint. It's not an exaggeration to say that this is the situation people of the Hisui region are facing. The tutorial doesn't start with you yet again saving the professor from a life and death situation, choosing your starter and off you go... I like it!

Graphically, there is a lot of room for improvement. Textures are somewhat presentable. Playing in handheld mode eases the pain but once you plug it into the dock and hook that thing up to a 4K-TV, you just notice the many rather unattractive aspects this game sadly has to offer.

Being already on the visual points, the attack animations are crisp and look very good.
NPC's finally look more like actual people with more added facial expressions, less repetitive movements (look up Sun and Moon as a bad example) and a IMO somewhat better dialogue in general.
Most character designs are creative, stick out and are memorable. Their personalities are not nearly as one-sided as what we are used to in the latest games so that even e.g. a group of thieves you encounter after a couple hours of gameplay explains, that they just steal in order to survive. There is just more reasoning behind the tasks and conversations you are faced with.

The ""multiplayer"" (if you can even call it that), is so minuscule that you would forget there even is such a thing. I would say that it actually adds to immersion that you are mostly alone in these open-world-levels but I would still gladly take an improvement to the current solution of just picking up other players lost items for a slight reward.

Trainer battles are very scarce. In a way it makes sense, since there shouldn't be many trainers around anyway (speaking logically). It doesn't lack of fighting in general since you do this more than enough with other wild Pokémon but there is a slight lack of the 'ol tiny bit of competitiveness you would get in defeating the Elite four. I would like to see more options to choose and challenge certain NPCs for a battle. There actually is a training ground in the village that story wise is maybe used only a couple times? (by the time I have played, there was only one battle on it). There is no real fighting interaction you can do to challenge someone.

The Music is good, the sound design has gotten better (i.e. you actually hear an echo of your Pokémons screams when fighting in ruins) and the engaging gameplay with its new fundamentals of stealthily sneaking up to Pokémon in order to catch them, actual trainer vulnerability and the other already mentioned things is just fun!

And that's what this game is: fun!

Grungus,30-01-2022,"If you love pokemon but wanted a fresh take on the series, this will make you happy and give you a lot of meat to chew on. The music, when it's there, is very nice in my opinion. I'd describe a lot of it as ""mystical"" or ""dreamlike"". The battle themes, however, seem less varied compared to past titles, as I can't recall more than 1 or 2 different themes throughout the main storyline. The main story is more or less typical pokemon filler, meaning it's the bare minimum you would need to call it a story and exists mostly to get you from point A to B. Some of the characters have nice designs, and there are ideas and concepts peppered throughout that caught my interest, but all in all the story is in itself quite bland and lifeless. Unfortunate, but not surprising. The game does not always look great, or even good, in terms of graphics. If you expected something that's consistently beautiful and polished, you'll be let down. The bulk of my reasoning for an 8/10 review score is the gameplay, which, depending on what you enjoy doing in open world style games, will either make or break the game for you. The alpha pokemon, the new battle/ catching system, and the exploration and gathering/crafting all scratch an itch for me. It feels fluid, fun, and satisfying to wander around doing these things in tandem. While the world itself is on the empty side and leaves much to be desired, there's enough out there to keep me wanting to explore. The pokedex research will put off some people who are more into the series for the competitive aspects, there is a lot of it and it is required up to a certain point. For people like myself who like to relax and wander without worrying too much about building a top tier smogon team and plowing through the battle tower, it's not going to deter me from enjoying the more laid back aspects of the game. Arceus Legends is a very important and positive step forward in the series. If they choose to keep going this way and learn from their mistakes, they could very easily create not only the best pokemon game ever one day, but one of the best open world games ever one day. They're far from that point with Legends, but I've enjoyed it immensely as a pokemon fan of more than 20 years.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Fludo64,30-01-2022,"The game is awesome, not perfect. It could be better for sure, mainly in the grafics departement. But after a 30 minutes of tutorial and some dialogue boxes the gameplay really shinies.

Doug22,30-01-2022,"As we all know is that pokemon has be at a complete standstill for the past 20 years, but now that legends arceus has come out I will admit that im pleased with the expirence and disapointed at the same time, with 20 hours under my belt i have to say, that this game is a good game. Iits not great but its not terrible but its just good. I highly reccomend not looking at the reviews because its filled with people giving the game 10s but also giving the game 2s or 0s so i reccomend just playing the game for yourself, i promise you will enjoy it.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

stickypoptartz,30-01-2022,"I do enjoy this game. Not as much as I would if it were a traditional pokemon game. My only gripe really is the opening; It felt like it took foreeeeeever to actually start my journey after having to shovel through dialogue and cutscenes, the tasks needed to advance. They just felt repetitive, and the world felt a bit empty. My entire time playing it, I was imagining what it would be like to do battle in a gym or wandering through kanto, hoenn, or johto regions with this new engine. I hope they think about doing such that for the next canon game.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
LemStar,30-01-2022,"This is the game we’ve all been waiting for as day-one Pokémon fans. Back in the days of Red and Blue, this is what we imagined the world of Pokémon to be like. The open areas where you can joyously yeet pokeballs at all the mons in the overworld is oh so satisfying. To be able to have a linear path with the story, but still give you a lot of freedom in terms of how you want to build your team and gain experience with all of the research required to complete the first Pokédex is a true blend of what fans have desired. While I think this game proves to be the strongest game in the franchise, gameplay-wise, I will say the artistic direction could’ve used a lot more talent. To see BOTW on switch as a launch title and look way more robust in terms of the environment than Legends, says to me that Gamefreak is in dire need of fresh eyes to lead them into their next core titles, as well as a beefed-up switch to enhance the overall experience. With that being said, the game is still looking to be a GOTY contender.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

rxe1224,30-01-2022,"I'm 10 hours in and look forward to this game. I was quite disappointed in my first few hours of the game (minus the opening dialogue, which gave me goosebumps). What i saw was an under baked game, with Pokémon sprites fluctuating in quality (depending on where you were standing) & a complete Zelda BOTW rip off with less charm.

However, once you get past the slow start & inconsistent graphics, the game starts to pick up. As your team gets stronger, you're able to do more & less likely to get destroyed in the wild. You can backtrack to see what you've missed previously.

Once you get used to the mechanics & know how to navigate around it's actually pretty fun. There are plenty of side quests it's actually a bit annoying & overwhelming because you'll see 10 trillion people asking you to do things in the village.

After **** on the game a bit, I do want to say there are some moments in the game that are really beautiful, e.g. the theme piano music starting as you're undetected in the grass & about to throw a pokeball at a Kadabra (lol). Also the combat is pretty good & quite visually appealing, although it's a bit derpy that you can run into the middle of the battle. Anyways, all things considered, the game has definitely grown on me & it can actually be a bit addictive

Anyways, after my quick review, I would say don't take my opinion for it, try it yourself & make your own mind up.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

BodiAdi,29-01-2022,"This game is great. I really like the world and how it's been set up in these games and some areas genuinely look really nice. The gameplay is also quite fun but also streamlined in many aspects and navigating through Hisui feels fresh and quite enjoyable. Sure it has some obvious downsides to the game(like graphics but it feels more like a lack of proper lighting and lackluster art direction where the artstyles of the world itself and the characters kind of clash) but if I'm being honest, this franchise has needed something drastically new for a long time and while this isn't the most revolutionary thing ever, this is exact what the series needs. This game is probably not for everyone either, considering it's a strictly a single-player experience about completing the pokedex(which I had never bothered to do before in previous games but for some reason I find it addicting in this game). I think people ought to buy it to encourage Game Freak that yes, we need more innovation and care put into future titles.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

For a first real departure from its standard all of its flaws are acceptable. Gameplaywise I hope the new mechanics will get improved on and will be implemented in future iterations of the mainline series.

The gameplay loop of going out and researching Pokémon and then coming back to the hub to manage your inventory, quests, etc.. is addicting. The performance is ok; it doesn’t ruin the immersion, but it could be better.

Gabrielchess,29-01-2022,"What an amazing game, the gameplay is just so fluid, it is the first pokemon game that makes you want to complete the pokedex. This game is a wonderful step forward to this franchise, the difficulty level is just perfect, you can get over-levelled, but the wild pokemon constantly tag team you, making it a 2v1 or maybe a 3v1.

The greatest flaw of this game is its graphics, some textures are actually really ugly, the moves are actually pretty beautiful, but sometimes the trees, or even the pokemon are not that good looking. Besides, the fps constantly decreases, but not in a way that bothers you a lot.

Since the game changes a lot the core mechanics, this game is easily the most noob-friendly game of the franchise, making the player learn about pokemon as they play.

Overall, pokemon legends arceus is a fantastic game with fantastic mechanics, it's the closest we ever got to the dream pokemon game. It's not a 10/10 because we know the graphics can be better, but every single aspect of this game makes me want to play it even more.

No, but it has its own stylization, charm, and the visuals are not nearly as bad as some people are claiming. Ground textures could be better, but other visuals are also quite attractive. The changes the game brings, the stunning and clean UI, sounds, music, maps, and unique story all excel so far. I know Game Freak and The Pokemon company probably have the money to hire the best of the best, but maybe they don’t want to do that and support/grow the teams they already have. If this is a giant leap forward for the innovation of Pokémon games, I can imagine the future will only get better.

Графика, да, это минус, но она соответсвует стилистике, а игра и правда очень стильная в своей минималистичности. Но игры про покемонов никогда и не были про графику, а про геймплей.

Reviewbrah2,29-01-2022,"I was very jaded when it comes to the Pokemon franchise, simply because GameFreak fed us with sub-par/overpriced games for the last 5-6 years that also contained design choices that were simply put baffling. The continous targeting of a younger and younger audience made the games feel like shallow, not fleshed-out ""mash A"" adventures. This is why I had so much trouble accepting this but here I am: Legends Arceus is a very decent game.

Story:
Right of the bat you have a story that is more akin to Gen5, one where people talk about actually dying. Not to mention that you get send down to earth by god himself. The stakes often seem high throughout the story, like at the point when the 3 bandit sisters snag Growlithe and you have to rescue it. The characters themselves are mostly fleshed-out, sometimes (like in the case of the male/female counterpart of the player) they could have done more but all in all the individual characters motivations and behavior make sense.

Dfficulty:
Not too difficult, not too easy. In my opinion they could habe bumped up the difficulty of the game quite a bit more but it is a decent level of difficulty where you can't just mash A until the credits pop up, which makes it far more enjoyable. Especially when you go out of your way to fight higher level alphas it becomes a lot more challenging (e.g. I caught a 61 alpha Ninetales when my mons were around level 40).

Gameplay:
This game is hands down the biggest departure from the usual formula and it does what it does pretty good. The new fighting style is different and refreshing, the fact that you can just run around during fights and even get hit by both the enemies AND your own attacks is a very nice touch. The crafting is a fun side activity that gives you enough oi an incentive to collect most of the stuff along your way, which makes for a more coherent experience. I love that you can just run into higher level areas and even fight the mons there, it felt extremely threatening to run into that alpha Snorlax at level 42 right at the start of the game.

Graphics:
Yeah, they are **** The Pokemon themselves look clean if I'm honest, the attack animations also look decent and oftentimes even straight up amazing (like Hyper Beam, Hydro Pump or Blizzard) but the terrain looks like some intern did it in a blender. The grass looks worse than Mario 64 and the cliff walls look like they even glitch out from time to time. Yeah, Graphics are not the most important thing in the world but I would have expected more than PS2 graphics.

Rest:
The sidequests are fun and diverse. Yeah at the core they are often similar and some of them are boring as well but the games usually sells them to you like they arent, which makes them feel less repetitive (you even have one where you catch a guaranteed shiny which you even get to keep).

You can put all of your Pokemon out of their balls in Jubilife and they even interact with one another. Such nuances never made it into the game or they were implement in a lazy way but it just makes it feel so much more realistic that way.

All in all: Legends Arceus is a good game and worth the money. You will get a very breath of the wild like feeling where you oftentimes just run around doing anything but the main story quest.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

MineTheAncient,30-01-2022,graphics dont make a game. people expect to much. people call themselves pokemon fans but cant see the potential leaking out of this game for the future. great game it takes the best of lets go parts and the main series game and throws them together in an exciting way. ive put 20 hours into the game so far and stilll get excited everytime i see a new pokemon. the distortion rifts add a fun way to get rare items and pokemon that make sense to the story as well as gameplay. the dodge machanic is also a feature that works well from the story letting you know that the world is dangerous and we dont know much about it.

thejuanvisu,29-01-2022,"Este es el primer juego de Pokémon que compró desde los, a mi ver decepcionantes remakes de Pokémon zafiro y rubí para 3DS. Me pareció un cambio de concepto interesante cuando lo anunciaron y decidí comprarlo ya que además se podía conseguir fácilmente por cosa de 40 euros.

De buenas a primeras pensaba que el juego seguramente se me haría muy repetitivo rápidamente con lo de capturar Pokémon, pero me equivoqué en este aspecto. Las mecánicas jugables de este juego son muy buenas a mi ver y he pasado un buen rato jugando este juego. En cuanto a las misiones, pensaba que serían más repetitivas, pero al final todas tienen su toque.

En cuanto al tema gráficos, efectivamente este es el apartado que más lastra el juego, se notan algunos logos borrosos en las ropas de los personajes y la forma en la que se ve el movimiento de los Pokémon de tipo volador en la distancia dejan un poco sin palabras por su falta de pulimento. De todas formas en general, el juego se ve decente, siendo a las largas distancias donde se notan principalmente estas faltas de pulimento gráfico. De todas formas este aspecto, a mi ver (Esto ya depende de cada persona), no afecta a la experiencia de juego.

Para ser un juego de mundo abierto (aunque este sub dividido en varias zonas es prácticamente de mundo abierto) el juego tiene muy pocos Bugs, algo muy difícil de lograr en este tipo de juegos, siendo el único bug que me he encontrado un Gyarados volador (Que según me dicen algunos, no es un bug...).

El juego también tiene ciertos detalles que me gustan, como que el personaje se va manchando con el barro o mojando cuando llueve o que el asentamiento principal del juego vaya creciendo y cambiando por tus acciones según vas avanzando.

A mi ver este juego es muy divertido y se merece un 8, siendo está nota así por su falta de pulimento gráfico.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Brusky,30-01-2022,"It's Breath of the Wild meets Pokemon, but with a bit of Monster Hunter mixed in.

And I love it! This is the closest we've been to an open-world Pokemon game that I've daydreamed about since I was a kid. Arceus delivers Pokemon Snap- levels of environmental immersion as a mainline RPG -- you will encounter pokemon walking/swimming/flying around in their natural habitats instead of randomly encountering something while blindly walking through tall grass. You can summon your own pokemon to gather berries, mine shards, and engage a wild pokemon all within a few steps without waiting for flow-stopping animations and transitions. It's truly like playing a simulation of the anime.

Issues that I had: Most bothersome to me might be the fact that you have to fast travel back to the hub city in order to go to the next zone (like Monster Hunter). It makes the world feel a lot smaller since it's just a bunch of disconnected environments instead of a huge continent. Also, no mounts at the hub city makes traveling a drag. Now for my minor issues. Some of the sound effects are clearly ripped from BotW, such as the male character sounding exactly like Link when he tucks and rolls. Maybe it was meant to be a callback, but personally I wish they didn't recycle assets like that. The graphics are also a little rough around the edges here and there. Some things like rocks and trees disappear if you slightly turn the camera. And the game sometimes draws pokemon at its max spawn distance, but animates them at like 2 FPS which makes them look bizarre against the more smooth and lively world closer to you. If the hardware is struggling to do this, just don't draw the pokemon that far!

Anyways, I'd give this a 8 out of 10. Rough around the edges in parts, but this is definitely a Pokemon formula I want them to polish and perfect. I don't think I'll be able to stomach the old style of pokemon games again. If Nintendo can somehow cram in a more modern setting with pokemon centers, cities, (etc) AND open world pokemon walking about onto the little Switch cartridge, it'd be absolutely perfect. It may be possible that the Switch may not have the horsepower to truly get to the next level, though.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

A hope for future entries to build on top of the foundation that is Pokemon Legends: Arceus and join other A-list Nintendo games such as Breath of the Wild, Metroid Dread, Xenoblade 2, and so on. PLA steals my attention with its smooth and seamless gameplay, numerous side missions and monsters to tame, absolutely GORGEOUS music, along with a difficulty curve that is refreshing for long time players seeking a challenge. Alpha Pokemon are especially fun and quite the challenge, and had me going, ""oh **** oh **** oh ****!"" the first time I ran into one. Graphics are.. lacking, sure, but not nearly as bad as some may say; in fact, some areas are beautiful enough to be worthy of a screenshot. The art direction is reminiscent of ancient Japanese ink paintings (which I believe was deliberate considering the era in which PLA takes place).. anyone who has played Okami will surely recognize this style. This is a game that can prove to deniers that graphics are not solely what makes a gaming experience great or special.

The game is fun first and foremost. As someone whos played every single pokemon game to ever release when they released. its a breath of fresh air to come away from a old clunky and boring system. Yes having abilitys would of been preferred, yes i get the competitive side being weak is frustrating for some people but for others who just want a solid non competitive pokemon game for the first time in many years this satisfys that itch.

iNuclearSlime,30-01-2022,"Been playing Pokémon since platinum and been through quite a bit of burn out from the last couple of games so how does legends hold up many will ask. Let’s get the big downside done first the lack of art direction I personally don’t mind lower graphics but this whole experience could of been more stylized like mhst2 or a game I picked up recently to play nino kuni which is a pretty old game it came out on the PlayStation 3 and is on switch but holds up because of it’s art direction. Second issue I’ve had is mostly the no abilities and held items on the Pokémon help differentiate Pokémon from each other in battle and because I like a few layers of complexity specially in turn based JRPGs.

Now we’re past the bad first can I can say is this is the most fun I’ve ever had catching Pokémon as the game allows you to engage them in a few different ways. Stealth is the first option and the method of my choice getting in the bonus from throwing the ball at their back is very satisfying, you can take the Pokémon head on in battle if you want but most Pokémon will run early game so for those who run start the battle back throwing your Pokémon at them from behind fun the stun. Filling out the dex I thought was gonna be tedious but it’s fun as you gotta engage with a few different aspects of the the game you can catch them to level up your research level of said Pokémon, give them berries, find ones of different weight/size, evolve, defeat them, battle with them to see them perform moves also yes it’ll count if you use them yourself in battle, and stealth catching them can also add to the research levels. Also exploring the open zones finding Pokémon is great specially when you find a rare encounter you didn’t see the first time going through the area. Pro tip heavy balls early game are your friend but you gotta get close but it’s worth specially for catching alpha Pokémon as they give a seed of mastery you can use to master a move back in town to use heavy or agile style with said move, great exp for the team, and a good chunk of money finally money which you’ll need to upgrading your inventory size.

Onto the story and characters without any spoilers they are pretty good specially by Pokémon standards. As usual Pokémon has very visually striking characters and they have great personalities. Too bad there is no voice acting which feels like the next step for Pokémon to go with their game as I have a tendency to speed read without voice acting and then kinda forget a little what is said after the fact but that’s me. But overall I think the story probably is the best I’ve seen out of Pokémon black and white.

In conclusion, I believe this game is great with all the ways you can engage with catching and filling your Pokédex. The technical limitations show very heavily but the Pokémon themselves are full of life and personality with how they are animated hopefully in the future these kind of games are allowed more time to bake in oven with a more solid art direction. Story and characters are great but still voice acting feels like it would do wonderfully in a series like this adding to the charming characters. Overall this game is an 8/10 if they continue with this formula for older audiences that’ll be a win",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

It is a great foundation of what is to come.

So what could be better and should be addressed either for a new game or even DLC:

-The graphics, obviously
-more diverse Pokemon behaviour
-more rich open world, with more interesting viewpoints
-sorting options for the Pokemon boxes
-maybe biulding villages from the groundup in the wild (like Taburasa in Breath of the Wild), as kind of a way to tame the wilderness

The gameplayloop just feels very rewarding and it's so much fun. With a little more polish in future games the franchise will reach new heights.

Skelmoor,30-01-2022,"Insanely good game, it's a really unique and amazing experience, there are so many cool new features that could partly even make it into the main series because of how good of an improvement they are.

Sturmgesang,30-01-2022,"I now have 18 hours of gameplay in the new Pokemon. And it's more fun than it's been in a long time. The fluid gameplay between catch, fight and explore is just awesome.

Tennex,30-01-2022,"CONS First:
- Not enough pokemon battles. There is less trainer battles than ever. Now that you can even avoid wild battles, by just throwing your ball. You get to use your hard crafted team less than ever. There should be more trainer battles to make up for this.
- Needs more puzzles.
- Needs more dungeons, multilevel caves, temples etc. The stone query was good but needs more areas like that, more levels, ladders.
- Dumbed down pokemon move variety. No abilities.

PROS:
- The definitive correct next step for pokemon.
- Different overworld pkm sizes. Seamless battle/overworld transition.
- Rider pokemon. Good job but also consider allowing other flying/4 leg/2 leg(climb) types. Just strap your straddle on an arcenine or luxray for example.
- Side missions are a good step. Overworld exploration done very well, plenty to do and get lost doing.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

CapybaraGames,30-01-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is not only an incredibly fun game, it's an incredibly fun Pokemon game. That means something especially when, up until now, releases of new Pokemon games have gone more stale than old bread. It changes almost all the mechanics which made the Pokemon games monotonous and tedious, and changed them into really fun mechanics. It's story elements is very well mixed into gameplay and while the game is not on par with the likes of Fable or Skyrim as RPGs, it is still a fun experience and a definitive step in the right direction. If you haven't tried Pokemon yet, this is the game to try. If you are a long-time fan of the series like myself, you'll feel a sense of astonishment that a Pokemon game can actually be enjoyable. Game Freak and the Pokemon Company have finally listened to fans woes. It must be noted that the game's graphics can be hit or miss at times with some animations looking like stop motion. This hasn't taken away from the experience though.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The game gets dark too, actually mentioning death a few times. I just hope they make this a series, because this is so damn cool.

Hylian_Hero,29-01-2022,"Overall I am thoroughly enjoying Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I’m about 6 hours in, and haven’t wanted to stop playing. Like any Pokémon game, the first hour or so (basically the tutorial) is a little slow, but that’s to allow players of all ages to learn the mechanics of the game. As others have said, visually the game is a little lackluster (it looks like what I would expect a launch title for the Switch to look like). Graphics aside, the game is a breath of fresh air for the series in my opinion. I’m enjoying exploring the world, learning the mechanics, and doing everything there is to do in the game. I’m definitely taking my time with the game and am enjoying every minute of it. I’ve read the reviews, and I think a lot of the 0 ratings are trolls who watched the trailer and didn’t like the direction the game has taken. Please don’t listen to the trolls, but also don’t take the perfect 10 scores too seriously and think the game is perfect.

This game does have a good story devoid of filler characters, if it has a world with interesting things to do more than the empty plains of the game with which it is compared. And instead of being filled with hundreds of shrines and kologs, each Pokémon to catch is a new experience and challenge without falling into monotony.
I love Pokémon Legends and everything that is proposed, and the comparisons seem more than hateful to me, it has nothing to do with BotW nor will it have it, its a game that in its own style knows how to stand out and be memorable.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

RPGProphet,31-01-2022,"Not the prettiest switch game. However, as far as Pokémon games go this is by far the best. It’s the kick in the a** the franchise needed and I have been glued to it since it’s launch. The battle system is a bit janky and I feel needs some polish but it is refreshing. While I have been exploring every bit of real estate I can touch, I still feel the “open world” definitely needs a little bit more life to it. Too much space with not a lot going on. You’re probably reading this and wondering why I’m giving it a 9/10 even though I’ve thrown nothing but negatives out. That’s simply because the game is fun. I feel like fun hasn’t been part of a Pokémon game in a while. I love being chased down by random aggro mons. I love the fact that there is an actual story. The ability to craft and farm is also a nice touch. Being able to swap a Pokémon's move on the fly is a great quality of life feature. Say what you want about this game but it is a step in the right direction. There’s plenty they did wrong but plenty also done right. I hope to see this “Legends” series continue. Amazing game!",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
orizalavande,31-01-2022,"A wonderful new direction for the regular Pokémon games, and certainly a welcome one. Yes, graphics could be better, but they do not undermine the core gameplay loop.

The only downside is the graphics, it should have been better and i think it could have better if they dedicated the game a bit more time of development.

Bloodbathbanana,31-01-2022,"In my opinion this game is the best pokemon experience ever created. It has addictively fun gameplay and the crazy part is that it seems like it was made to be a test prototype. The things missing are the traditional pokemon tropes like gym battles and even random trainer battles. If those two things existed in this game it would definitely be a 10/10. The access to being able to fully evolve your pokemon, switch out moves sets on the fly, and an easy to understand EV/IV system should be a staple to the series moving forward. This is a new bar that the franchise will have to beat going forward.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Narwhale73,29-01-2022,"Overall PLA is a great game that brings a lot of innovation (a huge understatement) and a more lively atmosphere. Plus it has a good amount of game time for someone to play (25-35 hours and up to 75 to complete everything). Plus it is overall well polished as I haven't seen any reports of major bugs or glitches and the Pokémon/attacks look amazing.

However, it has a lot of downsides. The newer Pokémon designs in the game should've been thought out longer in general (I say this as someone who likes around 97% of all Pokémon designs). The visuals are bad obviously, but personally I don't care about this as I would've played a PS5 game if I did. The story is...well..what you would expect from a kid's game. Nothing groundbreaking or offensive. My biggest and arguably my only real complaint, is that there isn't that much gameplay variety. You simply just battle and catch a certain amount of Pokémon, use moves a certain amount of times and do the ""boss battle"" attacking. This is all rather cool, but as explained, it needs a bit more in order to keep me invested. Also the national dex is small and the multi-player is nonexistent. This sounds like a lot of complaining but I am just trying to be as clear as possible about the flaws.

So should you buy it? It honestly depends on the person which I know sounds like a cop out, but this is the truth. If you want something that breaks free from the Pokémon formula no matter what:Yes buy it. If you're one of those people that complain endlessly about Breath of the Wild being Empty:Don't think about it. If you're one of those people that are strict and will be annoyed about things not being in the game from before:don't think about it. If you're someone who loves playing around with Pokémon and in the surroundings:Yes you will love it. Either way, I wouldn't worry too much whether you made a bad purchase or not as you'll still be able to have some fun.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Zehn,29-01-2022,"I was looking at all of the negative reviews for this game and all of them were just complaining about the graphics or the difficulty. The game is definitely more difficult than some of the most recent games but it's not too difficult. When I faint or lose, I don't feel like it's unfair because it's mostly my own fault. And the graphics are actually a step up compared to Pokémon Sword and Shield. Although they are a step up, they aren't too great at times. Sometimes you will see parts of hills in the distance randomly load in right in front of you or even sometimes tree or Pokémon on rare occasions. Overall, the graphics I'd give a low 7/10. But every other aspect of the game is phenomenal, and a big step up compared to previous entries of the series and is why I'm rating this game a 9 out of 10. This game truly is a great game and is a big step up compared to previous games. Especially comparing this game to Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl. And anyone who thinks that this game is somehow 'worse"" or 'just as bad"" as the other games, is completely wrong. This game gives amazing changes and some small changes you may not recognize your first time playing through the game. You can tell they put a lot of thought and detail into so many different aspects of the game.

Creo que los juegos están para disfrutar y desconectar, relajarte y pasarlo bien. Creo que nadie en ningún momento hace algo perfecto...siempre tiene algún defecto somos humanos y han sido años difíciles por la situación actual.

Pero en lo que respecta a agilidad y mecánicas jugables de atrapar pokemon y combatir me parece la dirección correcta en la saga. De hecho, si la siguiente generación no incluye esta jugabilidad me parecerá un gran error y que retrocede la saga. Espero que el mundo abierto, la exploración, la captura y los combates sin transiciones y ágiles vengan para quedarse para siempre. El estilo de combate prefiero el original en la saga original, en esta saga Leyendas está bien eso de “estilo rápido” y “estilo fuerte. La banda sonora también cumple sobradamente.

Legends Arceus, as a Pokémon game is incredible, it’s a refreshing new take on the tired old Pokémon formula while also streamlining many features originating from the older games. As a stand-alone game however, this game is still good but I can’t sing praise about Legends without taking about the graphical quality. On handheld mode, the graphics look perfectly fine and most people probably could get used to it within a matter of minutes however, docked the graphical issues are made much more apparent with the game looking like something from the GameCube or Wii era. In short, Legends Arceus is a great game and for those still on the fence about it, I highly recommend you try it sooner or later.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The variety of creatures and their animations are superb, the story is the best we have today (matching with B/W). Pokémon fans will love it, no doubt about it.

Attempts have been made to discredit it everywhere, unfair and incoherent comparisons have been made with other games, and they have sought to glorify indies that blatantly plagiarize Pokémon as ""better"" when in fact they are inferior (see TemTem or Nexomon) out of simple hatred and resentment for a national pokédex... None of this helped them because the game turned out to be the opposite of the malicious prejudices that were being formed:
-Well-made gameplay that meets in being fun.
-Objectives and missions not are repetitive at all

Urdrak,02-02-2022,"This is a new masterpiece brought to the pokemon community. I'll try to go over the positive elements and things to improve on. I'll also try to make it free of spoilers too.

""But things to improve on? You've rated this game 10 and it has things to work on?"" Sure do! I'm rating a game based on the fun I'm having, and the urge to continue playing, and both those things are over the roof. I'm having a blast, and the people around me who bought it too seems to be in the same place. So this is totally worth a 10 in my opinion.

Am I giving this a 10 just because it is pokemon? Absolutely not. Pokemon in the last few years has been hard to finish, in the sense of getting boring before you get to the good part ( The end game)

Lets start with the positives:
- Catching mecanics are really fun, using items to lure in, stun, scare pokemon while having new pokeballs that play with distance and surprise is a blast. Even if I have every pokemon in my pokemon Home up to this game, I'm enjoying catching everything I see for the first time in years. Trying to catch a pokemon by surprise is also really rewarding and fun.
- Overworld use of pokemon: Being able to chose which pokemon to throw in at any time is really interresting. Like preparing the right pokeball in case something goes wrong when catching, or knowing a pokemon of a certain type is hidden somewhere and using the best pokemon to uncover it.
- Crafting and in game economy is meaningful, the world is full of resources to look for and the money has its uses so you don't hoard it ( Pokemon has been giving too much to players in the last few games, to the point where it's hard to spend it all)
- Pokedex feels like you're really working on it, as it is not filling itslef on its own with just 1 encounter. While a good portion of it just fills itslef while playing normally, I often stop to check on the pokemon in front of me to see if I can work on something. The pokedex progression is also the game progression and it really feels like a fun goal to work on.
- Combat: Some base elements makes it more refreshing, like status effect for example, none of them last forever anymore, but they have some other effects, like the new sleep: drowsy, that makes the pokemon receive more damage. This makes such moves more interresting. In the previous game I was running around with a thunderwave pokemon and catching most of my stuff with that. The strong and agile style are interresting combined with the combat timeline. It's refreshing while staying close to tradition.
- IVs/EVs: are gone. replaced by a new system that is simpler. Although I didn't mind the old system, it was a bit tedious and getting redundant for me, so I welcome the change here.
- Breeding, while at first I was shocked that it was removed, was a boring portion of the game in my opinion. While I wouldnt mind having it back with a bit of rework, I feel the game is better without it for this iteration.
- Alpha pokemon, really fun little challenges to catch these everywhere. Love it.
- Shiny hunting is now fun in this game, gosh, it's weird to say that...

Things to work on:
- The story, while it is a good story for Pokemon (I'm not feeling bored like previous recent games) but I'm not feeling like I want to rush to know what's next. Maybe it is for the better though because I've taken my merry time to explore and experience the world and THAT is fun
- Competitive: They really need to bring battle between players in the future, it feels off to not have that option and it a fun part of the endgame to build a good team to battle.
- Graphics: I'm not sure why so many people complain here, the graphics are ok, even if not on par with games like breath of the wild, they are still ok. Pokemon has never been praised for its graphics... The lightning seems off in some places or when it rains, but other than that, it's totally fine.
- Battle with noble pokemon. While I do like the general idea and I'm having fun during these battles, its a little offsetting to throw food into a pokemon's face to calm it down. Like hell I would calm down if you threw me my favorite food in the face... The idea is fun to play, but weird as a concept.
- Inventory: I don't mind moving things to storage and managing my inventory, but surely some things can be done to help that process... same for pokemon ""boxes"" I guess. I feel I miss a couple things to improve the usage of both of these.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Top100Percent,29-01-2022,"Best game in years, the fact it makes some purists mad shows that this game will affect the whole franchise for years to come, and better the experience as a whole. 9/10 due to lack of accessibility settings",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Watson17k,30-01-2022,"I have played literally every Pokémon game over the last years. I still remember sitting in the car as my parents got me and my sister a Gameboy Color and a game for each of us, Pokemon Red for my sister, Pokemon Blue for me. I always had my rival growing up, trying to catch more, train harder, just over all be the better Pokémon trainer than my sister. She filled her Dex before me, but I had the first lvl 100 Pokémon.

I’m older now, internet has definitely impacted my personal connection to the Pokémon franchise because it made me feel less connected to individuals, but Pokémon Legends Arceus brought the personal connection to Pokémon I’ve missed for so long over the years. Yes, I love the old mechanics, but after 20 years of them I do think it is time for a fresh start, and Arceus did just that.

I see this game as Gen 1 of a whole new Pokémon experience, and in so I feel like this game is to be more fairly compared to Pokémon Yellow.

I’ll first touch on Multiplayer, since I see most complaining on the lack of multiplayer, but this game is not a game meant to have all the fancy online features that take away the truest soul and heart of Pokémon, the reason we all attached to the original games. It was the connection we had with our Pokémon and trading Pokémon. That feeling you get when a companion you worked hard on leaves your party, you feel it. Battles will be coming, but they need to build the world for us first.

Arceus needs to be seen as a foundation for what can come, and I truly believe Gamefreak sees it the same way. Think about it, the game starts off with us being sent into the past, before Gyms, before Pokémon centers, before even people and Pokémon achieved harmony. The world isn’t empty, it’s just fertile and ready for a civilization to be established. Jublife City is just the start.

Mechanic wise, this game revolutionized how to play Pokémon. Being able to run and throwing out your Pokémon left and right to gather material, cycling through them as you get in a rhythm and collecting even faster because you have your Pokémon helping. Getting caught by a Pokémon and throwing out yours just so you can actually run away a good distance away from the Pokémon attacking you(no more hitting Run Away button for me!), throwing all six of your Pokémon out so they can interact with each other, or even running into the toward the enemy Pokémon as you tell your Pokémon to attack. The mechanics let you interact with your Pokémon in so many ways. My rating is technically 9.5 for this game. But it’s a damn good start for the next generation of Pokémon.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Daitya,30-01-2022,"El juego me encanta. Pensaba que iba a ser un aburrimiento solo capturar pokemon, pero siento la emoción y los nervios para atrapar al que quería y huir de los pokemon alfas.

El aspecto gráfico es mejorable, y si llega a estar a la altura del ZBOTW sería un juegazo nunca visto. Pese a todo esto, el juego es adictivo y te engancha desde el primer momento. No sé como harán los siguientes juegos, pero espero que tengan en cuenta todo lo que han metido en el Arceus y no den un paso atrás.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Ocosu,29-01-2022,"Overall, this game is a breath of fresh air. It brings new elements and life to a system that has otherwise overstayed its welcome for the last few decades. I genuinely hope they keep this fusion of RPG/turn based system for Pokemon games to follow as it allowed the player actual choice and actual exploration that felt rewarding to me. Whether that be in the form of finding rare items or pokemon spawns, I never felt it was pointless to actually touch every corner of the admittedly large segmented areas.

As for player choice, there were many times I had a marker on the map which indicated where I needed to go to progress the story which I just ignored. You can explore, catch, and train pokemon at your own pace which as most Pokemon fans know, isn't the norm. You can find rare items, pokemon, alpha pokemon, and everything else freely from your second time stepping into the fields which was really nice. Ontop of that, there are multiple ways to completed your pokedex. You can battle, you can capture, you can observe, or you can raise them yourself and learn things about them. You'll see a lot of people on here saying it felt tedious, but they had options. They just didn't explore them or take the time to read them.

Of course there is a graphical downside, but I honestly never felt like it hindered my experience throughout my play through. It is an area they need to work on though going forward.

Without going too much into it since I want this to be a spoiler free review, this game is amazing. I can't understand people who are trying to say this is the worse Pokemon game to ever exist. It is far from the worse and easily ranks as one of the best imo. I really hope they intend to keep this formula, because I don't know if I can revert to the old system in Gen9 after experiencing this. This is a fun game and if you actually read into the mechanics and into the side quest, they give you a fun idea of the NPCs take on the world, your character, and many other aspects.

A lot of fun Easter Eggs are in the game too, so keep your eyes peeled for those!",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

32fromdiscord,29-01-2022,"Pokémon Legends: Arceus is objectively the best Pokémon game since HeartGold & SoulSilver. Since the series' gradual decline into stagnation and mediocrity starting with Black & White, it felt like there was no hope for Pokémon games to be good again, each title was getting worse and worse. Then comes Legends: Arceus, a brand new spin on the tired and overdone Pokémon formula, with a world that actually feels open and alive and gameplay that doesn't bore you to death. Legends: Arceus also brings a plethora of actual QOL changes to the franchise that Masuda and Ohmori were hesitant to bring, such as being able to learn moves whenever you want, and completely reworking the terrible, bloated EV/IV/Nature system that Ruby & Sapphire introduced. Kazumasa Iwao is the kind of person that needs to be in charge of the main series Pokémon games from now on. The fact that SwShills are attacking this game for actually having an ounce of effort put into it and actually... well... being a good game, just shows that Legends: Arceus is the kind of change the series needed.

VeritasReview,29-01-2022,"[SPOILER FREE REVIEW]
Overall this game is pretty good. Even though the graphics and textures are not the best they're still okay. On the other hand, they put A LOT of effort into the characters models, pokémon and animations in general. The gameplay mechanics are also really refreshing compared to the predecessors and the story doesn't follow the typical Pokémon formula [Evil enemy team, get all badges & beat the champion]. I barely encountered any bugs and even when I encountered one it wasn't anything game-breaking and it didn't disturb that much. All in all, I enjoy this game a lot especially because my expectations weren't that high, so I was really surprised when the game turned out to be good. Important to know is that Gamefreak barely made any games that weren't top-down perspective before, so it definitely lacks some depth in terms of world design but that will definitely get better, the more games they make in this kind of style. It's really hard to change a whole developers studio workflow. Just like the old pokémon games the graphics will probably get better from game to game.

About myself: The only Pokémon Games I've played were Firered, Let's go and Sword/Shield because I'm mainly a PC gamer. I know that there are things missing from old Pokémon games but from a non-biased non-nostalgic perspective, it's definitely an enjoyable gameplay experience.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

okamimiyazaki,30-01-2022,"A fun, challenging (at times), Pokemon game with an addictive gameplay loop and an interesting system of fighting and catching Pokemon. It's a huge step in the right direction! The graphics, performance, and multiplayer options need work, but those are the only major flaws. The story, pacing, battles, catching mechanics, exploration, and general gameplay are such an improvement over Sword/Shield and Sun/Moon.

There are major series changes that make big differences in quality of life, such as no limit to the number of moves a Pokemon can learn (they just have 4 memorized pre-battles) and not having to trade to evolve certain Pokemon anymore (using rare items on them instead). Exploration, crafting, gathering, and finding rare (and shiny) Pokemon have never been this fun. Gone is much of the tedium and boredom found in previous games.

If you care only about graphics or online competitive battles, you will find reasons to not like this game. But if you're into the collecting aspect of Pokemon, you will love this.

mack178,29-01-2022,"A game that only Pokemon fans would tolerate.

No other game could be this much of a technical disaster and still garner so much praise. Only Pokemon. Graphics, sound design, level design, NPCs, and more are so undercooked that I would have guessed this game was a year away from release.

The gameplay loop is fun enough: go out into the zones and catch Pokemon. Level them up, evolve them. Fill out your Pokedex. The same fun loop that Pokemon is built on, but opened up to larger zones (not open world). I'm happy that many fans are enjoying this. But wow, that is where my praise ends.

The graphics are well documented as being the worst of any AAA game in recent years. It's hard to overstate how bad they are. This is the ugliest major release of any IP I can remember. There is also no voice overs, or even the typical JRPG grunting. Just silence during conversations.

The open zone level design is a nice change, but it is marred by the game's ugliness. Not to mention basic, fun features like a following Pokemon or the ability to look at your newly caught Pokemon's stats in the field are absent. NPCs are also copy/pasted across the game, which is sad considering there are maybe 100 of them, if that.

I just don't understand how this game can be celebrated. Pokemon fans deserve better. There are early access indie games that are better optimized with better technical design than this.

My last critique is that the first 1-2 hours is incredibly boring, but apparently this is normal for Pokemon games.

I do not recommend this game.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC
davidsrjr,29-01-2022,"Here is a game that on paper gets me excited for a Pokemon game. After years and years of the same repeated game with different skins comes a new game that tries to be different. The problem is that each new idea feels cut short and never truly fleshed out. The visuals are boring and flat. People seem to confuse ""graphics"" with things like ultra realism or RTX but that is not what I am speaking about. A game can have simple graphics but still manage to set itself apart and look visually interesting. This game needs voice acting of some kind. The lack of voice acting just feels low budget and boring. Even a grunt would bring it up a point in my book at this point. The game play is fun and I would have enjoyed the open movement to play a bigger part in the battles. I think we are at a point where we can start to move away from the turn base battles. Final fantasy had a great solution in its remake where it could be toggled on for those who enjoy it but was not forced onto the player. Combat could be so much more by doing it real time. Heck even just getting rid of the one Pokemon limit when battling would be an improvement! It feels like they picked this time period so that they could finally do something different with the Pokemon formula but then chose not lean into it fully and we are left with half baked new features that just leave us wanting more. Hopefully this game will lead a future where Pokemon games can be something more than just an advertisement to sell merchandise!",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Squalexy,29-01-2022,"Imagine you're working at GameFreak and they tell you ""We're gonna completely change the formula and give the fans what they've wanted"" and then you hear applauses and screams of joy. But then, your boss tells you ""I know this is a huge moment for us and the fans, but you have less than a year to develop this game, because we're greedy and love money"" and you start thinking about your life choices.

Well, this game has proven to me that working at GameFreak is like wanting to be a prestige restaurant chef and then I end up flipping burgers at McDonald's.

How can you release such a boring, repetitive, unoriginal and ugly game in 2022? Unskippable cutscenes, awful story, awful characters, clunky movements, clunky aiming system (made my fingers hurt for the first time since playing on this console for 3 years), repetitive gameplay loop (collect resources -> craft pokéballs -> catch pokémon; repeat) and, worst of all, huge empty maps with nothing to do in them.

How can you build a fake open world game, with no activities to do besides catching Pokémon and craft items (the most basic craft I've ever seen in my entire life), make it so empty and run at barely 30 fps, in 2022, on a console that has released Xenoblades 2 and BOTW?

The only reason I don't give this game a 0 is because I appreciate immensely the effort to give the franchise a new direction and a breath of fresh (although smelly) air. THIS is actually a step into the right direction. I also loved the fact that the Pokémon feel alive and the move animations are actually pretty slick - but for me that's it, the game isn't fun at all.

Pokémon fans need to stop lowering the bar and be amazed at the low effort development this company brings, stop letting them treat you as if you didn't deserve more. You give them millions every year and this is what they do to reward you. Screw that, man.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

EasyGamerBoi,01-02-2022,"I had rock bottom expectations for this game up until the leaks if we’re being honest here. If you ever plan on playing/buying this game, do NOT watch anything Nintendo or Pokémon put out before the release date because the marketing did such a terrible job selling this game. But given Game Freak’s track record of the last decade, I’m shocked they were able to pull this off. Being a Pokémon fan in the last decade has been rough, ORAS was awesome & Sun/Moon were good too despite repeated playthroughs making me sour on them a lot, but everything else has been just short of a trainwreck. Gen 6 was the definition of lazy repetition aside from bringing everything to 3D, US/UM was the laziest rerelease I think of all time, the Let’s Go games were yet another unnecessary remake of the awful & boring Gen 1, we all know how bad Sword & Shield were despite their DLCs doing it a slight bit of justice & BDSP finally showed a lot of fans how much passion for this series has been lost by falling flat on their faces trying to “remake” their best games, they’re more of a remaster than a remake. But let’s get into it, Legends Arceus is a fantastic game & it’s THE breath of fresh air that we’ve needed for YEARS now. I might just have recent bias now but I wouldn’t mind if they didn’t make a main series game for a long time if it meant more games like Legends! Negatives first, the elephant in the room since this game got revealed were the god awful graphics & I can say they definitely touched it up quite a bit since then, but it still just looks plain bad. Like I’m playing a PS2 game in 2022, yikes. Immersion breaking graphics in your billion dollar franchise is inexcusable when this console has given us Breath of the Wild & Mario Odyssey, LEARN HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR GAMES ALREADY! There’s no reason that every previous Switch Pokémon game looks better than this one. The pop-in is so bad too, sometimes things just spawn right behind you or in front of you as you’re running around & it can get annoying when you want to catch a rare Pokémon that’s been giving you the slip. Also the button layout is really weird in Legends, to the point that almost 40 hours in I’m still hitting the wrong buttons when trying to open the map or open the bag to heal my Pokémon. Why is Y dodge?? Also made my hands cramp up a lot after long play sessions, PLEASE put out a patch where we can change the button layout. The Braviary flying feature needs work too. Why is there no accent button?! Having to take back off again & again after SLOWLY landing in these huge open areas is so… dumb. I think the biggest flaw aside from optimization is the lack of any voice acting. It was awkward in more recent games but never as awkward as in Legends. This game truly needed it, so many of the big story moments DESERVED more than a text box with that annoying ass boom sound effect.
But there’s also so much this game does right, catching Pokémon & completing the Pokédex has never felt better & will never feel the same in the slow mainline games ever again after this. Despite some Pokémon being annoyances to get, at least I didn’t have to shell out an extra $60 for a 2nd identical version just for 10 Pokémon they didn’t put in my game lol. The new boss battles are incredible too, actually fighting a Pokémon ON FOOT? I swear I had fever dreams about a game like this when I was a kid. I feel like the only person who didn’t black out during the story, Returnal has conditioned my reflexes to dodge effortlessly I guess. The wide open areas are all distinct & a ton of fun to explore, I actually really loved the Wild Areas in Sword & Shield so knowing this is what they had up their sleeve, bravo. Just wishing they looked like a 2022 game. The story, in true Pokémon fashion, is very lowkey up until the end as always, but this time I actually felt something! I was hurt, I was stunned at the stakes the story established, & the whole time I was filled with nostalgia feeling like a kid again. Impeccable line to walk there & that deserves a lot of praise! Just talking & thinking about it fills me with a childlike joy that has been gone for so long with Pokémon. It’s even got a fair bit of challenge in the new pretty good battle system, who woulda thought? Of course a lot of these positives have small quirks I didn’t jive with 100% of the time, but Legends Arceus is an amazing foundation to build sequels off of that will (hopefully) perfect it’s formula. At the end of the day, the damage previous games have done to my love & trust of Game Freak & Pokémon may never go away, but this game has done the impossible of giving me hope for the franchise again, I truly think this is a turning point for the franchise & I hope they go full speed ahead & never look back. 8.5/10",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

aukalender,13-02-2022,"Without doubt, a step in the right direction. The open world approach is simply the correct way to go with such a franchise.

It looks awful. The pop-in is terrible. Some textures are legitimately PS2 quality. If you look up at the sky and then look at your feet, the frame rate drops. Considering that Breath of the Wild, a 2017 game, can run a much better looking, much more stylized world with much better performance on the Switch, this is just embarrassing. The Pokemon in the wild don't seem to do much all, and are not organic, e.g. compared to a deer in Red Dead Redemption 2. I will not be told to compare this game with BotW or RDR2, because Pokemon makes a **** of money every goddamn year. It is simply the biggest franchise ever, think bigger than GTA, RDR, Zelda, Star Wars, Marvel, etc. They are bound to deliver something better to their fans. It doesn't even have voice acting because they don't want to spend the money!

What I want to see next time:
* A fully open world (not different sections as here) with actual people and towns and buildings;
* Actual missions and quests other than catch this many Pokemon (those are just fetch quests)
* All Pokemon included, animated and full of character,
* Battles, gyms, badges, and a Pokemon league with good AI,
* Better resolution, textures, frame rate and overall performance.

Poochingus,03-03-2022,"This game is almost average. Gamefreak still has a long way to go to justify their literally biggest media franchise in the world budget.

What this game did right is being a fun spin off with great out of the box thinking. It was fun to actually find new pokemon and keep coming back to interact with them. The concept was solid as could be. The feeling of pokemon being a genuine danger came across quite well, and it was fun to actually focus on how it would be in real life. I also enjoyed the different pokeball types too. I appreciate that for the most part, you are finally just allowed to explore and enjoy the game instead of being stopped every 10 minutes for some exposition. You get to take the story at your own pace. The actions in the game being tied to speed and having two additional combat styles was also a very neat concept that I think was done pretty well.

That, sadly is about where it all ends. The bad outweighs the good. This is still a game that had the world of money behind it, and it felt more like an indie game than a real AAA game. Overall, the general UX and UI were half baked. I look forward to the day gamefreak realize you can speed up combat by adding a 2x, 4x, 8x speed shift too. Combat may start and end faster, but its slow as ever in the actual fights. Speaking of that, the battles were sparse and boring. They also often pit you against 2 or 3 enemies with your just 1. Why can't I use multiple pokemon per battle? They fell back on being to conservative in that aspect. Combat was sadly easier than any game to date, and I realized I hardly ever needed to fight. The boss fights were all literally the same, and it was boring every time after the first one. Graphics improved, animations improved, but are still sub-par, in time it seems that will be iteratively improving, but I don't excuse it either way in the here and now. The end of the story felt very rushed and messy. Overall the story had me rather bored, and side quests were also a literal waste of my time so I stopped doing them. There are no unique quest rewards, just common items I can craft in low quantities. Crafting, while interesting, was admittedly, rather limited. I'd have liked more than just 3 pokeball types. Also full heals were pointless because after battle you got cured of status conditions. Another weird thing was a glitch that for me at least, %100 accuracy moves would often miss, for both me and the enemy. The only items I ever seemed to use were pokeballs and potions, and then occasionally food to feed to wild pokemon for pokedex goals. The ""HM"" pokemon were nice here. They were a great idea in sun/moon but the goofy baby safety gear ruined the vibe, so here they looked good. However I did find the way they worked didn't quite make sense. The flying one was especially bad, it was really just slowly falling, not flying. The lack of ability to do anything multiplayer of note outside of trades was also wildly baffling. This could have been a chance to explore and fill out the pokedex together with a friend in the survey corps. and each task you both did together filled out both pokedexes at once. Of course the biggest thing missing is battles. Honestly why not let me battle someone else? Makes no sense except to keep people buying the terrible gen 4 demakes. This would make up for the fact that this game has no satisfying battles in it at all. Also they removed held items and abilites. So there is that.

Overall I feel this was a promising step forward, but gamefreak still need to learn how to step up to the plate, and they need to stop pumping out games too fast. This will probably be my last pokemon game that I buy for myself. In future I may borrow a game or sail the high seas, but this feels like the last I'll be playing.

Blue9710x,04-08-2022,"Exploring the many environments the game gives to you is very fun and improves as you progress through the game. Grinding levels and catching pokemon has been made a lot easier, making these essential tasks much less tedious than in previous games. I find myself really enjoying the game when I'm let loose in Sinnoh with the goal of catching pokemon. But the Pokemon Legends: Arceus really struggles maintain that enjoyment when it keeps pausing the action to have a mid story being told to me by boring characters. This wouldn't be a big problem if I could skip the dialogue but I can't, and I'm left spamming the A button on my controller for 5 minutes to get back to the good part of the game. I also don't like the graphical capabilities of the game. I don't think graphics are an important measure to whether a game is good or not but the game looks very bad on a graphical level. During my playthrough I saw many visual glitches including a gyarados hundreds of feet above my character, multiple pokemon moving dozens of fps slower than everything else, and my pokeballs just not working to name a few.

From the graphics you can see right away that Game Freak has hardly taken any time for this game, but the same has to be said about the frame rate of this game I can still see the 5 FPS Staraptor in front of my eyes.
Most of the textures are just ugly and a lot of them need time to reload and that doesn't have to be the case.
So enough about the graphics let's get to the most important thing and that is the gameplay.
The gameplay completely convinced me and was even fun, and exploring the individual areas was also convincing.
You still can't call this game an open world game because you only move around in single areas in an open world game it would be a big and free world Pokemon Legends is more like a Monster Hunter game than a Breath of the Wild.
All in all, I have to say that the game was by no means pretty, it was really just ugly, but the gameplay and the story pulled me in a bit.
But after Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet were announced for the end of 2022, I slowly got the feeling that I was playing a €60 paid tech demo.

El problema aquí es que Pokemon Company es la empresa de videojuegos que más factura del mundo y tiene a GameFreak con 150 empleados sacando un juego de Pokemon al año. Juegos tan ambiciosos como este necesitan más tiempo de desarrollo y más cariño. Este juego no esta a la altura de los tiempos que corren, sobre todo viniendo de una empresa multimillonaria.

No voy a hacer incapié en el apartado gráfico porque salta a la vista los defectos que tiene, píxeles y dientes de sierra everywhere, incluso en primeros planos, un popping que asusta y mejor no hablar de los pinos esos.

La exploración y los encantos del mundo abierto están bastante limitados por el mal diseño del mapa, hay veces que puedes escalar colinas a saltos y otras que no puedes sortear la piedra más pequeña, por ejemplo.
A pesar de todas estas críticas, creo, sin embargo, que este juego marca la dirección correcta que debería seguir la franquicia por que tiene mucho potencial, simplemente me gustaría que Pokemon dejase de vendernos betas.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

carlosamegos,01-03-2022,"This game is a step in a new and exciting direction, but the world feels eerily dead and unfinished.

For example, there is a severe lack of music when running around the map. The pokemon just stand around staring into space instead of playing/chasing each other. The pokemon species all just kind of spawn in groups at certain spots, without much variation. The graphics are rather poor. You can finish the main story in about 10 hours. Like with most pokemon games its too easy.

There are some cool things about it though, especially the open world aspect. There are also fairly challenging events with rare pokemon, shiny pokemon to catch, and quite a few legendaries to catch.

I enjoyed it, but yeah, something about the emptiness really puts me off the game.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Caleidoscopio,02-03-2022,"En divertido pero no es la evolución que tanto gritan por internet, es más una adaptación de pokemon a la actualidad pero aún así leyendas arceus se quedara atrás en cuestión de tiempo, el apartado artístico es feo, las mecánicas de combate son la misma porquería pero la captura es donde el juego sobresale. La historia es hipócrita y mala y su mundo no es más que para pasear, no explorar como Zelda botw. En estándares de pokemon es el segundo mejor juego pero aún así no es suficientemente",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Lewisbwh,03-03-2022,"Legends Arceus is kind of bad but also kind of fun. Catching Pokémon in real time as opposed to in a Turn Based Battle screen is seamless. Exploring the Open Environments is the best part of the game, seeing which Pokémon appear in which areas. The game can be surprisingly challenging at times. Died twice to the Arcanine Boss which is two more times than I did in the entirety of Sword and Shield. I think not having Pokémon follow you and interact with the environment more is a missed opportunity, as well as only being able to ride these designated special Pokémon as opposed to your party Pokémon.

Visually this game looks awful, textures are all washed out, Pokémon sometimes move at like 5fps. When you are moving around in the world you don’t notice it, once you stand still you definitely do. The story is nothing special either. A lot of dialogue boxes which just serve to waste time and stretch the game out. Despite all these problems, this is still worth playing if you like Pokémon. It’s not a blatant cash grab like BDSP, it had effort put into it but it still isn’t up to the standard expected from a Triple AAA studio.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Climbing is completely out if left field, it feels like a cheap version of breath of the wild, i want to play pokemon why is this feature there? It makes no sense and it just forces me look at the ugly graphics even more. I have very few good things to say, the alphas are the only enjoyable thing, like hunting for them and catching them is satisfying. The most important downside for me is the world is so visually ugly, i didn't expect that because previous games like let's go eevee were so beautiful visually, it was definitely a downgrade in that regard, a very glaringly obvious downgrade.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC

livin_dreads,04-06-2022,"I'm going to stay on the middle ish ground.... as much as excited as I am for this game, really enjoying it overall - there are a few things that make my blood boil. Namely the difficulty... and don't bring up the ""Alphas"" because putting a lv 60 pokemon into a lv 7 area is ARTIFICIAL difficulty. The fact that EVERYTHING levels every time you fart is one of my biggest gripe. I have constantly had to switch out over levelled pokemon if i wanted any semblance of a challenge (again Alphas do not count, they're cheap and stupid).
but the biggest baffle of all............ why no trainer battles? I get it, this is ""time skip back to the past"" where they still just getting their toes wet dipping into the goodness that is the world of pokemon etc etc.... but the game HAS trainer battles in it, so why not make them good?
at any popint someone asks ""wanna try and battle?"" I'd be like yea i've a roster of 6 *insert random pokemon here"" aaaaaaaaand my enemy is....: a SINGLE UNDERLEVELED Literally impossible to lose.

patnott,14-06-2022,"I gave this game a 5 for effort. Game Freak actually did something a little different. I welcome the changes in how wild encounters work and the seamless integration of wild battles. That’s where the praise ends. In 2022 such appalling graphics is unacceptable in my opinion. I know Pokémon was never cutting edge with its graphics but even the widely panned Sword and Shield had better graphics. Only 1/4 of the entire roster of Pokémon features in this game. That’s shockingly bad I think. After you complete the post game there is nothing at all to do except shiny hunt.

3. The game was so repetitive. It’s just catch this and catch that and get that thing a million times over. I got over it.

Wer denkt sich, machen wir den mal so hässlich mit der Mütze. Naja.

Dann zum Spielspaß, das mit wichtigste. Und ja, das haut irgendwie rein und man verfällt direkt wieder in die Suchtspirale. Es bockt und man möchte alle Pokémon fangen, die es zu fangen gibt. Da es im Endgame dann aber in Fleißarbeit ausartet, in dem man irgendwelche sonderbaren Sachen machen muss, waren es am Ende dann bei mir doch nicht alle Pokémon.

Das absolute Ende hab ich im übrigen auch nicht gesehen, da man Arceus nur zur Gesicht bekommt, wenn man zuvor alle Pokémon zumindest gesehen hat, was Entwicklungen mit einschließt.

Die Geschichte ansonsten bis zum normalen Ende ist langweilig und bietet nichts neues. Ich hab mich da einfach wild durchgeklickt.

K3tamine,19-04-2022,"Creo que los cambios de fórmula deben valorarse como lo que son, cambios. No por romper con una fórmula clásica considero que estemos ante el mejor juego de la historia de Pokémon, ya que creo que lo presentado en Pokémon Leyendas, aun aportando una serie de ideas interesantes para construir un futuro refrescante y distinto para Pokémon, y aun siendo radicalmente distinto a Espada y Escudo, acaba pecando de lo mismo que los juegos de 2019: te diviertes jugando, te pasas el final del juego ya bastante cansado, y a la vitrina con los demás.

Considero que el juego es en general divertido (aunque no me acabe de ilusionar el estilo ""Collectathlon"", ""hazte con todos"", que acaba aborreciendo), el nuevo sistema de combates engancha bastante, el apartado sonoro como siempre es sobresaliente, y hay muchas píldoras de ""fan service"" muy estratégicamente colocadas que hacen que pongas más interés y que conectes con el juego. Sin embargo, no puedo decir lo mismo de los apartados artístico y gráfico, ya que hay decisiones de diseño bastante extrañas, sumado con unos recursos técnicos pobres para Switch y para lo que podíamos esperar del juego. Los nuevos Pokémon, en mi opinión, son pasables, pero no están al nivel de los de Espada y Escudo. La historia no es muy memorable, además de que hay varias cosas demasiado metidas con calzador, aunque el diseño de personajes sí que mejora respecto a Espada y Escudo, ya que se les otorga mayor profundidad.

En definitiva, veo interesante explorar nuevas fórmulas para no sobrecargar el JRPG clásico que siempre ha sido Pokémon (aunque me quedaré con las ganas de ver otro título sobresaliente de este estilo como fuesen Platino, Blanco y Negro o Sol y Luna), aunque no por ello debemos bajar unos estándares de calidad que, tratándose de Pokémon, han de ser bastante altos.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Unfortunately the game had big issued with the graphics, visuals and performance, and it was obvious that wasn't going to change before the final release. Its clear that Nintendo doesn't have the same care or love with the Pokémon franchise, because the would never let a Zelda or a Mario sold in this state of unpolished and unfinished product. Overall the gameplay was fun, that´s the main thing, but the story was bland and uninteresting and didn´t make up for the technical problems of the game. And then just months after that they release a trailer for Pokémon Scarlett and Violet which makes feel this game as if just a tech demo of whats comming next.

HeraticParadox,13-03-2022,"To start off with something good, I enjoyed the alpha Pokémon mechanic. I like that any Pokémon has a rare chance to spawn as an alpha, and I enjoyed hunting alpha variants of the Pokémon I wanted to add to my party. It made my party members actually feel special and unique from all the other Pokémon running around in the over-world. That’s pretty much where my praise for the game ends. The core game-play loop of catching Pokémon and filling out the Pokédex was acceptable, although the boss fights felt really bland and out of place. I felt just entertained enough to keep playing, but it never really felt great. I often felt that it was just barely enough to let me ignore the game's glaring flaws for long enough to complete the game. Clearly the graphics and performance of the game are some of it’s low points. This game might be the worst AAA title graphically in video game history when compared with other AAA titles releasing within a year. There’s a ton of pop in, especially when flying and there are significant frame rate drops for objects that aren't even that far away from the player. That being said, the poor graphics and performance were hardly what I disliked most about the game. The writing in this game was just painful, which is a shame because the story had so much potential. There were some seriously good story beats there, but the writing just made everything feel flat. None of the characters are relatable, the choices you make feel meaningless, and everything from the main quests to the side quests just feel completely lacking in substance. On top of that, the Arc Phone might be the laziest game mechanic in the history of lazy game mechanics. Why on earth, would a character who is literally a part of the survey corps responsible for SURVEYING the land and Pokémon who live there not just make a map. Instead the Arc Phone just magically gives you maps of new areas, and the other points in the game when the Arc Phone activates is just sheer disrespectful hand-holding on the parts of the developers. They must seriously think their player base is the most unintelligent group of people on the planet earth. This game feels like a bare bones tech demo for a game set to release in a year or two. It’s a shame that more effort was not put into it, because I can see the potential and that, to me, is what makes the failure to give us a solid finished product so much more painful.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Raksel_Airon,18-02-2022,"Tras unas 40 horas jugadas en Leyendas Arceus, me veo en la obligación de comentar lo positivo y negativo de este nuevo título en la franquicia, una en la que llevo metido desde su primer juego hará ya más de 20 años. Leyendas Arceus ofrece una nueva forma de explorar y capturar a los Pokémon, renovando la forma en la que realizamos los combates y un poco acercándonos a la fórmula de mundo abierto, aunque con ciertas limitaciones. Si bien las primeras 15 horas las disfruté bastante, pronto me di cuenta de lo repetitivo que acababa siendo llegar a un nuevo lugar y que tras un par de horas explorando a fondo, sentía que muchos espacios estaban desaprovechados, y que podrían haberse aprovechado para meter más puntos de interés o que tuvieran alguna sorpresa inesperada. En la base, siento que es un juego que de aquí a un par de entregas va a ofrecer un resultado muy firme y sólido y que gradualmente se acercará más al gran juego soñado por muchos de la franquicia. Si mi nota no es la más alta no es porque no me guste, sino porque sé que a la larga, usando esta base obtendremos juegos cada vez mejores y más interesantes, con más variedad de situaciones, entornos, con una mayor inmersión, más actual a nivel artístico. Pokémon Leyendas Arceus es un juego muy entretenido, refrescante, y que sienta una base para juegos mucho mejores. Además, la narrativa ha sido más interesante que en otras entregas, y espero que siga así.

Cosas que me gustaría que volvieran o estuvieran en el futuro:

- Más combates contra entrenadores. Por la temática, es lógico que en Arceus no hayan muchos, pero espero muchos combates contra otros entrenadores en futuras entregas, como en los juegos anteriores. La dificultad la han llevado bien en Arceus, y me molaría verlo reflejado en combates contra líderes de gimnasio y una liga Pokémon.

- Modo PVP. El competitivo me es indiferente, pero molaría que hubiera una forma para combatir contra otros jugadores.

- Más Pokémon. Por temática, ""entiendo"" que no hayan más, pero espero ver de vuelta a muchas criaturas en futuras entregas de temática más moderna.

- Una mejor banda sonora. Muchos temas de Arceus eran remixes de Diamante y Perla, y tampoco es que fueran mejores que los originales. Es el juego con peor banda sonora que recuerdo de la saga o que sea más olvidable.

- Zonas más variadas en temática y que tengan una mayor inmersión y interés a la hora de ser exploradas.

Y eso es todo. Si Game Freak acaba actualizando el juego, que sé yo, sacando modo PVP o más criaturas, alguna zona extra más única a modo de expansión, etc, quizás la nota suba. Al final, lo que le ha faltado en parte son cosas que ya teníamos y que aquí se han visto sustituidas por la temática del propio juego.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Br0nev,26-03-2022,"Esperimento positivo, ma grezzo e moooolto ripetitivo. Fra i fattori più positivi vi è l'esplorazione nelle prime ore di gioco: bene, proprio questo fattore diventa il suo più grande tallone d'Achille. Finché sei blind e ti senti l'Indiana Jones dei Pokemon è tutto bellissimo, quando le aree le hai esplorate in lungo e in largo e le steppe di Hisui diventano una estensione del tuo salotto buona parte di quella magia svanisce e la seconda metá del gioco diventa parecchio ripetitiva, il mero prolungarsi di una cosa che hai fatto giá per 30 ore, ma per altre 30. A finirlo ci ho messo 65 ore (mi rimangono una ventina di side quest, e la missione principale relativa al completamento del pokedex) e ho il bisogno fisico di staccarmene, quando io di norma su un titolo pokemon classico ci passo 150h (pure su quelli che mi fanno cahá, perché comunque fra competitivo, villa/albero lotta, alta rigiocabilitá etc c'è tutta una sfera multiplayer post-game che funziona a prescindere dalla pessima qualitá del titolo: in Leggende Arceus, tutto ció è invece completamente assente). Su Pokemon X l'orologio segna 999.59, perché oltre 1000 non va. Sì alle migliorie di quality of life (rimozione degli IV, EVS molto più accessibili - ma c'è bisogno di un level cap massimo, altrimenti diventa un pigro maxare tutte le statistiche), no alle semplificazioni del combat (mosse di stato stravolte e rese spesso completamente inutili) e alla rimozione delle abilitá. Il fatto che sia un gioco interamente single player, per quanto limita la longevitá a minimi storici (a meno che non siate shiny hunter, nel qual caso avete il vostro nuovo gioco preferito di sempre), ha il pregio di non far pesare granché lo striminzitissimo Pokédex di neanche 250 pokemon (sui quasi 1000 che esistono), al contrario di titoli principali come Spada e Scudo nei quali la rimozione di certi pokemon e mosse ha significato la loro forzata assenza dal multiplayer (e quindi se uno dei pokemon che vorresti usare è uno dei 400 rimasti a casa - o meglio, su Home - sucks to be you). Mi viene quasi da sperare che non venga implementato l'Home Support e Leggende Arceus resti ""isolato"" nella sua bolla, proprio in quanto titolo atipico per la saga. Tante belle cose, ma alla ventordicesima volta che ti fanno rivisitare la stessa costa, palude o foresta per non far quasi altro che catturare pokemon, la mancanza di Palestre, allenatori e battaglie degne di questo nome si sente. Rimane una parentesi positiva, che poi questo abbia un impatto positivo sulla saga classica è tutto da vedere: se riescono ad amalgamare il meglio di queste novitá con la formula canonica potrebbe uscire qualcosa di carino, al tempo stesso non posso scartare la possibilitá che Scarlatto e Violetto ereditino il peggio di Leggende Arceus e seppelliscano la saga principale che non vede ormai un degno rappresentante dal 2017. Insomma, un bel titolo con le dovute premesse, piacevole ma ancora molto grezzo (e tecnicamente raccapricciante, ma questo è stato giá ripetuto fino alla nausea).
Un 7 per l'impegno se lo merita, per essere un indie di un piccolo studio non è male (che poi sia l'ultimo titolo di punta della saga videoludica più di successo della storia è un dettaglio). Scherzi a parte, ci sta, va bene, promosso, pollice su. Prima sufficienza dal 2017, incredibile.

GF, ci rivediamo a novembre, sperando nel meglio ma aspettandosi il peggio.

In terms of story without spoilers is alright, it may not be my favourite storyline out of all the pokemon games but with the setting and characters it feels a lot more braver compared to any mainline game where they tackle issues like pokemon actually being threats towards humans.

With all said the reason it's not rated higher is that they have these new mechanics but the entire game is just a repetitive system and quickly gets boring after the first 2 areas where they don't introduce anything new except transportation methods.

Being able to catch Pokémon without battling them, sneaking up behind them in an open zone, is very entertaining. However, the game lacks one CRUCIAL element to any Pokémon game: Replay value. It becomes a slog to play through the game again, being forced to complete Research Tasks in order to gain Research Stars, which are required to reach the next area. Grinding out moves on weaker mons (which usually means heading back to the first zone), leveling up through friendship, and specific items which only appear in the Distortion Zones (which can also be bought with points gained from finding Lost Packs, which is grinding in itself), it all detracts from replaying the game. And that's if you weren't focusing on these issues your first time around, instead being wowed by how different of a game it is for Pokémon.

Pokemon Legends Arceus looks worse than PS2 games from 2004. While graphics don't make or break a game, it is hard to enjoy playing a game when it's hard to look at it. At it's core I don't even mind if a game doesn't look great. My favourite game of all time is a Gamecube port of a Dreamcast game. But Pokemon Legends Arceus, a triple A release from a studio like Nintendo being priced upwards of $90 in some regions, has no right looking and running as poorly as it does. It reeks of a low effort game rushed through to release.

Some people will argue that it only looks bad because it is on the Switch. This is simply untrue. Beautiful games exist on the Switch. Just look at games like New Pokemon Snap, Breath of the Wild (the game this game tries to emulate), Monster Hunter Rise, Splatoon 3 and more.

The Nintendo Switch's is not to blame for PLA looking and running as bad as it does.

Game Freak not putting any effort into it is what's to blame and it's just disappointing.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Cou,30-06-2022,"It is a fun game all in all. But i harshly lower the score immensely due to the post challenges. As a casual game it is a 8 out 10, however when you want to finish all missions or quest. The quest they given is outright time consuming and not worth the effort. This might as well be a rant. The reason is. Who is the right mind want to spent their time grinding a wurole to lvl 100 just to fight a staraptor?? Just to get a badge?? Sure it gives it longevity, but this is so irresponsible for game freak to think this was smart and clever. This is probably why I lost faith in pokemon games... and sadly they are proving that fact firther down the line. I will however say it was a breath of fresh air.

Nightscape_,01-12-2022,"Now this is a Pokémon game! Just picked this up a week ago instead of Scarlet and Violet due to their graphical and performance problems. I am happy I did, this is one of the best Pokémon games I have ever played! It has been hard to put down. How did they go from this well polished game to Scarlet and Violet that barely runs and looks like garbage? What a downgrade!

It is not a perfect game, but it sure is fun. I love that you can see the Pokémon in the overworld and can battle right there; it makes the gameplay very fluid. I like that when traveling around your human character can be attacked by Pokémon and takes damage as it makes it feel more realistic (these are supposed to be wild animals after all). It also has one of the better stories in the Pokémon series; in fact, it might be my personal favorite. I actually remember the characters' names and their motives in this one! It is fun to do the side-quests to meet new people, Pokémon, and learn more about the game lore. Few of the side-quests are too time consuming and didn't complete them but that is my only real complaint about the game. I did think the purple shadow textures look off, but it is not that big of a deal, it just shows the skill and education limits of the game designers more than anything. I really like the pasture your Pokémon are kept in. It is neat to walk by it and see some of the different ones you have collected. I also like the Feudal Japan style, it really works well. And I have to say, the amount of clothing and hair options is the best I think I have ever seen in Pokémon.

This game has a couple flaws but no game is perfect and the good more than outweighs the bad. It is like the game designers actually tried to make something fans of Pokémon would love instead of a soulless cash-grab like Scarlet and Violet.

Seriously, skip Scarlet and Violet, vote with your wallet and pick this game up. It is pretty much what a Pokémon game should be.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

sunny_rip,01-02-2022,"Easily the most fun I've had playing a Pokemon game yet! I love exploring the world of this game, I like almost all of the new forms of old Pokemon, I think the new Pokemon are really cool. Honestly for a Pokemon game, the story is pretty good, and the game play loop, while it's different, it's pretty fun, and makes catching Pokemon very fun to do.

The game isn't really focused on fighting and collecting gym badges, instead you build up the first Pokedex, it sounds like it's grueling, but it's easier to make progress than you think, and it feels good to reach new ranks and go to new areas, the Ride Pokemon in this game are very fun to use, and feel well integrated into the design of the environment. Speaking of the environment, it's really good looking, the graphics look very polished and honestly is one of the best looking Pokemon games, this is definitely one of, if not my favorite game in the series. Really my only complaint is that your own Pokemon can't follow you in the world, and sometimes trying to get your rank up can feel a little tedious.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
PokemonAdventur,01-02-2022,"Pokémon Legends: Arceus innovates and moves the Pokémon franchise in many ways. Pokémon battle transitions seamlessly take place in the overworld, and only happen when you throw out one of your Pokémon’s Pokéball. This removes annoying random encounters, but there’s still danger to traversing the wild. Aggressive Pokémon will attack you! It’s pretty difficult. Battle animations have received an overhaul and now look super cool and actually run over and hit each other. They are also properly sized, and wild Pokémon are now more powerful.

Grinding for exp game loop is replaced with research tasks, giving you a reason to fight and catch various pokemon, with a different set of goals for each pokemon species.

Let's Go and BDSP were inferior versions of FRLG/Platinum imo and SwSh really lacked when it came to exploring and content over all. Therefore I can't believe it that GameFreak finally did it again, they finally made an awesome Pokemon game again. The new catching mechanics, huge areas to explore, an interesting story (in terms of a Pokemon game), a lot of side stuff to do etc. Now that's what I call a next level Pokemon game. Graphics could be better but they aren't bad either, up close they can look really nice but it's the draw/render distance that could be better.

JaidenReviews,01-02-2022,"Simultaneously the best and most embarassing thing Gamefreak has ever released. A fantastic 10/10 game bundled in a very obviously underdeveloped package. The Pokémon models and animations look great, but the world itself looks like an early progress shot I would see an indie game dev share on twitter. It's laughable how bad the game looks in some areas, especially most caves and in dark areas (where the background will literally warp around your character like you're poorly greenscreened in). I have many other gripes, such as the story pacing (a lot of dialogue scenes either need to be cut shorter or be more interesting. Voice acting would've helped). But otherwise the game is honestly fantastic. My favourite Pokémon experience to date. I just wish it came out like a year later so it would have all the development time it needed. I would love this style of game to continue and be iterated on, it's a major improvement over the old formula; having a game like this with more settlememts to explore and more complex side quests, etc would be a dream. Also thank god that they only released one version.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The action based catching mechanics are perfect. Try to sneak up on a Pokémon and catch it and if that fails smack it with a mud ball and try to catch it again. Movement with the mounts and the freedom of movement in the game is a very welcome addition. Graphics could be better, and it could be more polished but overall, the value of entertainment of Pokémon Legends Arceus is spot on. I also enjoyed the story and side stories in the game.

I went yesterday to my local store to buy Monster Hunter Rise and then when I was paying they told me if I also wanted to take Pokemon: Acreus that it had released a couple of days back. Personally never played a Pokemon game before and thought to give it a try. My first impression was not good, to be honest (and the reason for knocking a couple of points form the score) is that the graphics and presentation are bad for a 2022 released game. Lets be honest, it felt like a game released in a previous gen. Music is also very very generic and just serviceable as well as the sound effects. Having said that I just kept playing and the game has some special charm, the controls are good the environments are ok but its great to see the little Pokemon just running around and doing stuff and you trying to capture them or battle them. So far , I am hooked, its definitely an enjoyable game and now I want to level and use all the pokemons that I have captured. Honestly its a good game with terrible graphics, but you kind of get used to them. I havent even had time to open Monster Hunter Rise nor finish Metroid Dread. I am sure you will enjoy this game.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
aSkorm,31-01-2022,"This is surprisingly good! The new gameplay loop is really enjoyable. It feels amazing to be able to explore the pokemon habitats. Being able to quickly pick between pokemon and send them out whenever you want feels great. Gathering resources is streamlined and doesn't feel like a chore. The fact that battles take place in the overworld and you don't lose control of your character also feels amazing and it helps connecting to the world and your team a lot more.
The story is also more developed and engaging than anything Gamefreak has done in the past. Some characters are a bit too over the top but I guess it wouldn't be Pokemon without that.
The presentation is the biggest drawback. The pokemon models look great and they are well animated. The VFX is also great so you won't be disappointed with the way the moves look. The textures however are absolutely horrible. There's a lot of pop-in and there's this purple shader over everything for no reason. The frame rate also dips in the mid twenties from time to time. Especially during boss battles. Also, no voice acting which is a shame.
Overall, this is the biggest step forward the franchise has ever made. By far the most enjoyable Pokemon experience. I hope they bring as much of this as possible into generation 9.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Detorded,01-02-2022,"Game Freak finally tried this time.

This was a major step in the right direction for the franchise after decades of stagnation. So far I have put roughly 16 hours into the game and am still loving it; the novelty of catching and battling Pokemon in an open world setting still feels fresh after all these hours and I can see myself playing this game for hundreds of hours. I have played every single Pokemon game since the original Diamond and Pearl and I can confidently say that this is the best Pokemon game I have played in a long time - Game Freak have finally managed to make the Pokemon game we've all wanted since we were kids.

The Pros:
-Gameplay is better than ever and fits seemlessly in an open world.
-Gameplay loop is addicting and rewarding.
-Feels like a more mature game with a higher difficulty.
-Maps only get better after the first area.
-Ambience music is beautiful and immersive.

The Cons:
-Graphics could have been better if the game was given just a few more months.
-AI is better than Sword and Shield - but still has a long way to go.
-Story is bland.

Starting with the negatives: the game is rough around the edges and if Game Freak's games weren't rushed, they could have taken a few more months to polish it and make it look even better. This goes for the AI too, as Pokemon are often just sitting around doing nothing. Luckily, depending on the Pokemon they will react differerntly to seeing you - some will get aggressive and chase you, some will run away from you, and some won't care at all. Unfortunately, even the most aggressive Pokemon are extremely easy to run away from and don't present much of a threat. It is certainly a step-up from the lifeless Pokemon AI from Sword and Shield, but with a second entry I hope to see Pokemon acting uniquely within their own habitats similar to Pokemon Snap. Lastly, I found myself ignoring a lot of the main story as I couldn't get engaged with it, and preferring to explore and do side-quests instead.

While the graphics, AI, and storytelling could use some improvement, it's apparent that Game Freak spent a lot more time on the more important aspect of this game: the gameplay. Gameplay is king in Legends Arceus and it's easily the most addicted I've been to a Pokemon game since I was a kid. Everything is very seemless in the open world setting as they finally ditched the time-consuming and dated battle screens and loading screens in between areas. This game feels like it actually belongs on the Switch - unlike the awfully-outdated Sword and Shield. The game loop is very addicting as you go into the open fields to collect resources to craft items which will help you on your journey as you catch as many Pokemon as you can to complete your Pokedex. Most importantly, Pokemon has long suffered from the criticism that it's too easy - while this game isn't hard by any stretch, it does feel like the game has matured for older audiences quite a bit. I've noticed Pokemon battles are usually a lot more difficult as the game no longer warns you which Pokemon your opponent is sending out beforehand, and the AI generally seems to be a lot smarter when attacking you - my Pokemon got knocked out frequently.

The first area (Obsidian Fieldlands) is a bit bland and may not be the best first impression for gamers, but fortunately after the first area, the maps get significantly more interesting. The biomes change to swamplands, to coastlands, to clifflands, to snowy mountains - all with unique ways to traverse them as the game continuously gives you new Pokemon to help you get around. The music adds a key element to what makes exploring so much fun, the ambience music in this game is beautiful and adds just that extra bit of immersion when exploring. Especially for players of Diamond and Pearl (or even the remakes) the music is often remixed versions of the old soundtracks of Sinnoh, and visiting old places and seeing them realized in an open world (such as the lakes) makes for a very nostalgic throwback.

All in all, the closest Switch games I can compare this to is a mix between Breath of the Wild, and Monster Hunter Rise. It has the style and presentation of the former, with the addicting gameplay mechanics similar to the latter. This game is a strong 8/10 and I pray that Game Freak keeps this new formula and expands to it - it would be very disappointing to see them go back to the old style of games after this.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

xavier14,01-02-2022,Pokémon Legends Arceus is a breath of fresh air for the franchise after playing 8 generations of game that all feel like the last one. The new catching mechanic makes catching Pokémon fun again and not some long and annoying prosses to catch the Pokémon you want on your team or if your trying to fill the pokedex. The more open game makes it feel like you a have more freedom the in past games and that's a huge plus for me even if its not completely open world like BOTW. The difficulty in this game is also something to love because not only is battling regular wild Pokémon a bit of a challenge but the new alpha and noble Pokémon can 1 to 2 shot almost any member of your team if you are not crazy over leveled. Also dodging Pokémon in the game is also a challenge I blacked out 3 times from Pokémon attacking me. I promise you if you are not paying attention to make sure Pokémon don't see you and if multiple Pokémon are attacking in mass you will have problems. I'm 24 hours in and I still haven't beaten the 3 noble boss fight but so far the story is ok it actually feels like a story compared to SWSH but those games were still good to me. I could go on all day about everything I love about this game but I still have to say that this game is not perfect. The graphics could be a LOT better but they are not God awful like others say and the framerate of pokemon from far away is just bad but nothing bad when in battle or up close to them. Also wish that we could skip cutscenes like in SWSH cuz there is a LOT of dialog so if want to replay this game get ready to mash A through of the talking in the game. But even though the game has its problems they don't out weigh all of the good things in this game and I hope Game Freak takes the base of this game and expand on in it with good graphical features because this game to me is the best Pokémon game so far.,9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
finowmenal,01-02-2022,"Ich hatte viel weniger erwartet, als ich mir Pokémon Legenden Arceus vorbestellt hatte, da im Vorfeld viel über die Grafik und die Performance gemeckert wurde. Und ja, mir ist in der Tat aufgefallen, dass auch dieser Titel von Game Freak wieder die eine oder andere Schwäche aufweist. Aber nach kurzer Zeit ist das schlicht und einfach vergessen, da das Spiel einfach nur abholt und mitreißt. Sei es die Geschichte, die ziemlich ausgeklügelt ist, denn man landet in einer frühen Version von Sinnoh aus Pokémon Diamant und Perle. Kleiner Spoiler: Eigentlich kommt man aus der Zukunft und wenn man sich die kleinen Easter Eggs anschaut (Kleidung der Protagonisten zu Beginn des Spiels, dann der NPC ""Hin"" und die Manaphy Quest, welche eigentlich nur zu lösen ist, wenn man Pokémon Strahlender Diamant oder Leuchtende Perle gespielt hat), dann kommt man schnell auf den Trichter. Ansonsten ist vieles schön umgesetzt. Ob es nun die Pokémon-Weide statt der klassischen Boxen ist, die Tatsache, dass Pokébälle handgemachte Gegenstände sind und alles eben in diese Zeit rein passt, oder die musikalische Untermalung einfach immer wieder an Diamant/Perle erinnert, alles passt einfach gut zusammen. Einzig kleinere Aufgaben nerven, wie die Kinoso-Nebenquest, wo man den Eintrag für Kinoso vervollständigen muss, was aber nicht wie bisher durch einmaliges Fangen geschieht, sondern eben wie bei allen Pokémon von bestimmten Kriterien abhängt, die man erfüllen muss, wie z.B. fange Pokémon x mal/x mal unentdeckt, nutze diese und jene Attacke... Das kann, wenn die Spawnrate eines Pokémon beschissen gering ist und von bestimmten zufälligen Faktoren abhängt, nervig sein. Aber ansonsten ist dieser Titel gefüllt mit Spaß, das Jagen von Shinies macht mega viel Spaß dank der doch hohen Spawnraten (1/128 bei Massenbegegnungen mit Schillerpin), man hat auch einiges an Sammelkrams für längere Nebenaufgaben, wie zum Beispiel Geisterlichter (107 Stück auf 5 Welten verteilt), damit man am Ende Kryppuk fangen kann oder das Sammeln des kompletten Icognito-Alphabets. Was ich gut finde ist auch, dass man nicht mehr gezwungen ist, mit anderen Spielern zu tauschen, um ALLE Monster zu bekommen. Sämtliche durch Tausch erhältlichen Entwicklungen kann man nun nämlich bequem mit den jeweiligen Gegenständen entwickeln, zum Beispiel Metallmantel für Onix, um es zu Stahlos zu entwickeln. Machomei, Simsala, Gegner und Co erhält man nun, indem man bei Maschock, Kadabra, Gegner und Co die neu eingeführte ""Verbindungsschnur"" nutzt. Geile Idee! Auch die Bosse, die so genannten Könige machen Spaß. Vergleichbar ist das mit dem System aus Sonne und Mond, wo man auch ein Bossmonster bekämpfen musste. Trainerkämpfe sind übrigens selten und beschränken sich auf relativ wenige Protagonisten aus dem Diamant-/Perl-Clan, und einigen anderen Charakzeren, die übrigens auch teilweise viel Ähnlichkeit zu ihren Nachfahren der Sinnohregion aufweisen. Pokémon Legenden Arceus ist ein richtig tolles Spiel.

martinho_99,20-02-2022,"I really really really can't understand how people can give 10 points to a substandard game. This game looks, feels, sounds and plays worse than games that came out 15 years ago. It may be kind of a new start for the franchise (I am a huge fan or at least I was). But the grafics are a disaster, the controlls are bad, there is no voice acting, sound affects are lazy made, animations are ridiculously bad or non existing. Please be honest and compare it with games like God of War 4, The Last of Us, RDR2 etc., these are todays 10 points standard. Or even compare it with the level of other Nintendo games: Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, Mario Galaxy, Luigis Mansion... Pokemon became Nintendo's worst games by far and this game is sadly not doing any better.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

TheAvP,31-01-2022,"Graphically has quite a few issues, there's no doubt about that. There are times were pokemon will spawn and be absolutely jagged in movement and its not really fun to look at.

That being said, this is the most fun I have had in a Pokemon games since, what, Pokemon platinum? I am a Pokemon fan. I would have fun with most Pokemon games BECAUSE they were about Pokemon. Legends: Arceus, on the other hand, has me enjoying the game because it's genuinely just a fun experience all round. In the game, i WANT to complete the dex, I WANT to catch everything I see, i WANT to play for hours on end without any stoppages. It has completely revolutionized the Pokemon series.

Karothacker,31-01-2022,"Personally, I think Legends Arceus is the best Pokemon game since Gen 3 (I'm not stating that gen 4+ are bad, just that gen 3 was my favorite game until now. Could change again, not entirely sure.) I'm enjoying it a lot. 20 hours in so far. Here are the ""highlights for me so far.

* Although it's not going to win any awards, the story is the best a Pokemon game has done in a long time.

* Catching mechanic is amazing. No more going into a battle to weaken them and then throw a pokeball. Just hide, toss, wait, and repeat if necessary. There are some limits and exceptions though.

* There's something very satisfying running across a Pokemon you didn't know was in the game or that is a rare spawn. Pikachu, Eevee, Chimchar, etc are all available in the first area.

* You can choose when to evolve your pokemon once they have met the requirements.

* You can switch out moves anywhere at any time as long as the pokemon knows them. No more forgetting moves and having to reteach them if you mess up.

* ""Boss"" Encounters are fun and challenging at times. Although, you're not gonna lose anything if you die.

* A specific mechanic (no spoilers) that opens up mid story is VERY challenging if you want to go after them for the rare items and spawns.

* Alpha Pokemon are very fun to fight and catch. They have the highest AI in the game and are actually smart. lol

* Personally I like the graphical style they chose. Again, not going to win any awards but I like it.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Cait_Nostamas,31-01-2022,"A new, refreshing experience for the franchise, and definitely the most fun I've had with Pokemon in years. While the technical department is certainly lacking in graphics and model optimizations, that doesn't take from the first experience of an open map Pokemon world. The characters, lore and story are solid, the level design is smart and diverse, and the combat system is fast, fun and immersive.

I pray that TPC will take this as the new direction for their games, even if it has to be a secondary series of games. With more time, work and optimization, this game could've easily been a 10",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

rhyaken,01-02-2022,"Regardless of my initial skepticism, I believe this is a really nice / fun game. I wasn't really sure I would enjoy this entry since I have always been more focused on pokemon battles with gyms and the pokemon league, rather than completing the pokedex. This game is solely related to completing the first pokedex. There aren't many trainer battles, which are made up for by introducing new challenges: for example alpha pokemon.

I think they nailed the gameplay loop quite well, Arceus introduces an open world game where collecting and training pokemon is a lot of fun and engaging. I haven't enjoyed the latest main line games that much (Sword and Shield / Diamon and Pearl remake) and Arceus really feels like a much needed breath of fresh air for the series.

This is not the best pokemon game ever made, nor is it going to satisfy everyone. If you are interested in a new take on the Pokemon series, where you can freely explore a world full of pokemon in an engaging setting: then this game could be right up your ally.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

oggiVVV,31-01-2022,"Some reviews for this game baffle me. Decided to post my own because some of the reviews here make the game seem better/worse than it is, claim things that are straight up wrong and some of them aren't even reviews, but just rants against the fans/developers. Half of them also give me the feeling that the writer didn't even play the game.

8/10 from me. The game actually shakes things up when compared to previous Pokemon games. The new gameplay formula is actually fresh and interesting.
This game revolves mainly around building the first Pokedex of the location where the game takes place, the Hisui region. In previous games, filling up the Pokedex was done simply by catching a Pokemon, and the whole page for this Pokemon would be filled up immediatly. That is not the case here. Catching a Pokemon will only get you so far in this case, despite what some others claim here. To fill out the rest of a Pokemons Dex entry, you'll need to interact with this Pokemon in a variety of ways. Catching and battling are obvious, but there's more to it. Seeing it use certain moves, evolving it, finding different forms/genders, feeding it, and so on. All of this will get you closer towards a complete dex entry. Thankfully, you don't have to do every task to fill an entry.
When compared to previous installments, the total number of Pokemon in this game is lower than usual. There are a total of 242 Pokemon in this game. Some may say this lazy on Game Freaks end, but I personally think that this is fine. Filling out the Pokedex would be a nightmare to do if there were a lot of Pokemon, which is a problem since that is the main focus here. Also, again despite what others may claim, there are plenty of new animations present for each Pokemon, so having a lower amount seems fair. Every Pokemon also has their own personality in the wild. This Pokedex and catching focused approach makes for a fun gameplay cycle.
Speaking of the wild, this game isn't just your standard Pokemon RPG. There are 5 big, open maps for you to explore, each of which are unique. They are well designed, exploration is rewarded with collectibles, items and Pokemon, but not mandatory. Catching Pokemon is handled differently here too. You can do it the standard way by battling them and weakening them, but you also have the option to catch them outside of battle. You may want to take a different approach depending on the Pokemon you're after. Some are docile, some are hostile, and some are easily scared. You can choose to sneak up on a Pokemon using the environment around you, or lure them out with food. If you are being attacked, you have to dodge their attacks, initiate a battle, or throw objects at them to stun them. The new types of Pokeballs complement this system well.
The battle system has also seen some changes, specifically the new attacking styles and turn system. The turn system was previously just done with the speed stat deciding who goes first, but now the speed stat is more important. A high speed can give your Pokemon multiple turns back-to-back, but this also applies to the opponent. The new attacking styles also impact this, as a strong style move makes you slower but more powerful, while an agile style move does the opposite. Both styles also take more PP than a normal move. You can also walk around during these battles, but this doesn't have much of an impact on anything. Some battles will even have you outnumbered against multiple Pokemon at once.
Due to the setting/story of the game, trainers aren't very common, but they are present. Gyms/Leaders aren't here, and have been replaced by the Noble Pokemon. These are essentially the bosses of the game, and have you battling them unlike any regular Pokemon.
I'm sure you've seen this plenty of times, but graphically, the game is sub-par. The main issue seems to be muddy and low-res textures, bland lighting (lack of shadows and reflections) and some performance related issues (render distance of objects and the framerate of NPC's/Pokemon). Graphics don't mean everything but in this case it's all very noticable and should've been better. The game runs fine at 30 FPS overall, with a few stutters here and there. Music/Sound design however is some good stuff, but this has always been a stronger point for this series.
I'm no expert on stories but what's here is fine. It's pretty interesting, mainly due to the setting. First two or so hours are pretty dialogue heavy due to tutorials and whatnot and could've been a bit less.
Quality of life improvements are definitely present. The best change here is probably a better gameplay flow thanks to the better menu design, and less menu's in general.

Overal, a big step and a fresh take on Pokemon. A new approach to gameplay and a fun cycle keeps me invested, with quality of life improvements everywhere. Graphically sub-par, bur story and sound design are fine. Interested to see where Pokemon goes after this. I'd say it's worth full price.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

If you play many franchises, or even multi platform, the game is mediocre in every way. It’s a bunch of good ideas terribly executed. The game feels poor (budget) regardless on The Pokémon Company being a 100 billion dollar empire. Their product doesn’t reflect their power at all.

If you are just curious to try a Pokémon, this will fell just like what it is, with no fanaticism and biased thoughts, a mediocre basic and rough game.

Turndown4hwut,01-02-2022,"Pokémon has had a rough transition to 3D. Between the games getting easier to the point of being braindead, the fact that routes feel less like places to explore and more like corridors with occasional wild Pokémon battles, and the designs that keep getting worse and worse with each new generation, the cracks in the seams became a lot more noticeable. This reached its peak when the series made its proper jump to the Nintendo Switch with Pokémon Sword and Pokémon Shield, directed by Shigeru Ohmori, cutting about half of the Pokédex only to sell it back to you later down the line, and just generally looking like an upscaled 3DS game. And then we get the long awaited Sinnoh remakes with Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl, directed by Junichi Masuda, only if you wanted a Sinnoh remake that actually improved on Gen 4's foundation, you're never going to get one until modding gets more advanced.
So, with Ohmori most likely working on Gen 9 and Masuda attempting to polish up BDSP, enter Kazumasa Iwao, director of Pokémon Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon, the first game in the 3D era to actually feel like a game. And I think it's safe to say that if anyone needs to be the director of future Pokémon games, it needs to be Iwao, as Ohmori and Masuda are holding the series back. This was the big jump that Pokémon needed, and I'd say it delivers. Yeah, the visuals aren't that great, and the game can either feel grindy, or like a collectathon, but with every Pokémon you catch, you're making progress through the game. I'm currently about to start the 5th area, and the only reason I didn't make this review sooner is that the game is too much fun. This game could very well shape up the future of Pokémon, so do you want more visual novels with occasional monster catching elements, or actual games to sink your time into? If you want the latter, then buy this game.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Gatch55,31-01-2022,"Gamefreak's first big deviation from a very successful formula, while still utilizing the parts that made Pokemon so great.

Graphics: not stunning but they do not detract from the experience.

Gameplay: The flow between battle and open world is seamless. No more waiting 10 seconds everytime you encounter a pokemon. As someone who started with 1st gen and quit playing due to pacing issues after gen 3, to pick it up again recently the pace feels much faster than any game since gen 3.

Setting/Design: The designs of the region/Pokemon have a old world theme to them, the rest are as you would know and love. Except Garados flying though the sky like a Boeing 747

Story: while I have not finished the game yet. It is not the same story that has been in every Pokemon game past gen 2. No boring badge hunt. Instead we are filling out the pokedex to gain stars within the faction.

Best Feature: everything to experience is contained in one game not two titles with Pokemon missing from each.

Summery: I think this is the best thing that can happen to Pokemon. It feels like a step forward for a franchise that has stuck a new coat of paint on the same game for the last 20 years. I hope this sticks and become the new standard for the main line of Pokemon games",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

I hope this will continue to be the new style of games that game freak makes because if it is I’ll be there day one for all their new games.,10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

ZXSth,16-12-2022,"In his YouTube video on the Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Arin Hanson comedically rants at a metaphorical representation of one of the franchise's successive instalments, Skyward Sword, is lauded with praise entirely because it rides the coattails of its predecessors. Similarly, I believe that much of Pokemon Legends: Arceus' praise has been heaped upon it simply due to the fact that it is not the same abhorrently mundane, head-bashing, mind-numbingly repetitive slog that most Pokemon games have become. While Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a solid open-world adventure RPG, this game has come about 10 years too late, in my opinion, and lacks the nuance needed to stand on its own two feet in a world populated with games that not only outshine it, but also came out almost ten years ago.

Arceus has some strengths: Its open world is fun to explore, and speeding up Pokemon battles streamlines the combat in a really positive way. Additionally, the core experience of the Pokemon games is here, which will likely please series veterans craving more of the same. And of course, needless to say, shaking up the Pokemon formula after so long is an incredibly desirable and long overdue change of pace.

Despite the game being a rather pleasant experience, this game seems, at its core, to be a moderately successful hodgepodge of Pokemon Go and Breath of the Wild. At its best, the game is a streamlined Pokemon experience; at its worst, it is a slog through a somewhat lifeless and archaic-looking semi-open world, where the same tired, outdated turn-based battle system is used. Somehow, after 25 years, Pokemon games are still managing to survive using what is almost exactly the same simplistic, turn-based combat that arguably does little to differentiate itself from the first Dragon Quest game on the NES - a game made in 1986.

While many may see this game as a step in the right direction for Pokemon games to go, I cannot help but think that the game is not a big enough step. As nice as it is to see that Nintendo is willing to bend a bit regarding one of their flagship franchises, not enough risks were taken - risks that would likely elevate this good-enough experience to heights only hit by the original Red and Blue games.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Nintenderek,04-02-2022,"I've been playing Pokemon games since gen 1. I've enjoyed every Pokemon game since then. Pokemon Legends Arceus is a great video game, perhaps one of the best on Switch if not the absolute best, but it is not the best Pokemon game per say.

First off, graphically, it looks fine. Pokemon games have never been visually impressive and I personally don't see a whole lot of difference between this game graphically and something like Breath of the Wild. The sounds are great. The music sound track hits hard and the game itself makes good use of sound effects. Sometimes you can kind of tell where a Pokemon might be just by listening. It helped me a lot as it was much easier to tell when a Pokemon was about to attack. Performance is fine. The game is 30 FPS, but it's a consistent 30 FPS. Personally, while I do prefer 60 FPS, I don't actually mind 30 FPS as long as it's consistent and the framerate here is good enough for me.

Of course though, this is a Pokemon game, so gameplay is what really matters. This game is very fun and very addictive. It's relaxing to go out looking for Pokemon. The boss battles need a bit of work, but generally I've had fun with this game. It's very addictive. I don't have a whole lot of free time due to work and stuff, so the fact that I've played about 50 hours of this game in just the last week that it's been out says a lot. The crafting system is a nice idea, but it needs a bit of work to be really good. A lot of the resources you gather are only good for one or two specific items and that seems like a bit of a waste. It would be a nice if you had to think about which resources you wanted to use for which items and if each resource had a few different uses. As it is, you have resources that are very specifically for certain types of pokeballs, resources that are very specific for certain types of medicine, etc. It gets to a point where you simply just don't collect certain resources because you simply have no good use for them. The Pokemon themselves however is what really matters. Battling them is fun and switching between the overworld and the battles themselves has never been better. I do think the move pool is lacking. I noticed a lot of moves seem to have been taken out of the game and while in some ways that helps balance the battles, it makes it difficult to get the right moves for certain Pokemon and type coverage becomes difficult. Speaking of variety, Pokemon is where this game needs a LOT of work. The Pokedex is only about 250 Pokemon, the smallest we've ever had outside of remakes. Most of those Pokemon are from Sinnoh, which makes sense given the story. However, it's a bit disappointing to see such a limited number of Pokemon in this type of enviornment. There was about 10-12 Pokemon that seem to be available in every area and with as many Pokemon are there are, this simply shouldn't be the case. I know people have complaints about Sword and Shield, but this is something they really got right with the wild area in Sword and Shield, so it's disappointing to see how limited the selection of Pokemon is here. A 400-500 pokemon size of Pokedex would make a lot more sense here.

The story is very good. It's not the absolute best story we've ever gotten in Pokemon, but it easily makes the top 5. My only real complaint is that there is much too much handholding through the story. In other Pokemon games, this makes sense, given how linear the games are in the first place. Here however, it makes a lot less sense given the open world enviornments. All I really want to do is explore the enviornment and they almost seem to force the story upon you instead. I do like the rewards for Pokedex completion and completion of the game itself as you go. This game gives the most insentive to keep going out of all the Pokemon games and easily gives the best rewards. You get money for pokedex completion and I find myself continuing to catch as many Pokemon as I can so I can get more money to get more items and clothes. I do wish there were more clothing options, but the ones that are there are good. There's also way more shiny hunting options than usual, which is nice for people who enjoy that sort of thing.

All in all, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a very good game, but if you are looking to pick up your first Pokemon game, I'd recommend Sword and Shield first and then checking this out afterwards. This is easily the better game, but Sword and Shield is the better Pokemon experience where you get to see and do more Pokemon related stuff. I'd say both games are 100 percent must plays for anyone interested in Pokemon. Pokemon Legends Arceus is very good groundwork for future games and I certainly plan on following to see what they continue to do with the Pokemon Legends series. I think with a bit of refinement and just generally taking everything a bit farther, this very well could be the future of main line Pokemon games and that excites me.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Pokemon can clip through the environment, and certain textures (I’m looking at you, water and shadows) cause crazy pixelation of everything around it. Like, horrible pixelation. But, don’t focus on that. The game has heart. So much heart. It is literally breath of the wild meets pokemon. With a little bit of animal crossing crafting, and Fire emblem’s garach Mach monestary.

Make it truly open world. Create better AI for roaming Pokémon, interactions with environment, better animations. Add gyms back in the next one, allow us to ride your own Pokémon on ground, air, and sea. Add more towns and cities to explore. More caves and dungeons, add more raids. And add a multiplayer aspect.

dragonblade,31-01-2022,"This game is one of the most important entries that the Pokémon company has ever done. Thankfully, this game delivers an experience that many Pokémon fans have been waiting for years. However there are small flaws or annoyances that keep it from being the ultimate experience for a Pokémon man.

Let’s start out with some flaws. The game doesn’t look at its best even for Nintendo Switch standards. Everything seems to just be a lack of polish or detail. But that doesn’t mean that the graphics are always bad. Just to the point where it starts to get distracting and sticks out. The fixed camera when first entering a battle or talking to an npc can either clip through or be completely obstructed by an object. (Thankfully in Pokémon battles you can move around the battlefield) One more thing is that through the three noble Pokémon battles that I have completed, which serve as the boss battles of the game. They all feel like dodge and throw, with no real gameplay depth outside of it. You can send out Pokémon when the noble Pokémon is stunned, but you can completely ignore this message and keep on throwing balms and win without sending out a single Pokémon. That’s it on the flaws, I might edit this review if I encounter more problems or good things about the game. Now for the good things. First of, this is a complete shift from the traditional Pokémon formula. There is no gym battles, elite four, or any league to become champion of. Your job is to research Pokémon and create the region’s first Pokédex. I feel this gameplay can make or break some peoples interest to buy this game. But, I encourage Pokémon fans to give this a try for themselves to see if this is the style of gameplay they enjoy to play. The gameplay is about catching and researching Pokémon in which the objectives can vary between defeating the Pokémon with certain moves, feeding it berries, seeing it use moves, or just straight up catching it. Alpha Pokémon can also appear around the map and will always be tens of levels above your party. Pokémon can also deal damage to you, the player causing you to faint and lose some items if you take too much damage. I love the animations of the Pokémon, because they were able to focus on a smaller pool of Pokémon and actually delivering on that promise. (Let’s not talk about SWSH) Pokémon battles have also increased the freedom of the player. Now after a battle starts, you are freely able to move around the battlefield and look around with different viewing angles. A new mechanic is added with agile and strong styles of moves. Agile moves decrease the power of the move and give your Pokémon more likely chance of getting their next move soon. Strong style is the opposite, increasing power and less likely chance of getting the next move sooner. This does give an extra layer of strategy and also scraps the idea of alternating moves. You can and will get two turns in succession or take two moves from an opponent in a row. Side quests can be lackluster but be a good thing to do when you don’t want to progress the story. Speaking of the story, I really can’t judge the story based on my opinions because of my style of gameplay. But when I can say is that there is more dialogue and a lot more cutscenes than a regular Pokémon game. All in all, I support the gameplay direction that gamefreak is trying to do and hopefully this can be a regular occurring series and that some of the ideas will be implemented into gen 9 and beyond. I am a big Pokémon fan and I hope that gamefreak will finally turn around the quality of games that have been released these last few years.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Also the company really don't know how encourage players by placing good fast-travel spots; like, there are no fast-travel before bosses or important battles, so you can't adjust team or select items right there and try again. So good luck running around the world again and again with the worst experience.

MadMaxxieXD,14-02-2022,"So the game is very fun at first but the luster wears off badly as it goes. Initially I rated the game an 8 but as you play, you see the ugly visuals, battling is terrible in this game, the style system is horrible, barely any moves, lots of battles where it's you versus multiple Pokemon that can all potentially have multiple turns each before you can even do anything, you can send in a Pokemon and have it die without even moving if it's slow because of the styles. The boss battles are a mess, the first couple are fine but by the 3rd you start to wonder what the designers were thinking, certain attacks are basically impossible to dodge and it goes against the idea of the game being more simple(SPOILER example, Arcanine, it's whole thing is it dashes across an arena with lava and you have to leave enough space to dodge him, fine, then he just puts a massive fire ring in the middle of the arena that completely blocks anywhere to dodge sideways as he tackles, but if you go in the ring you die, it's a mechanic that makes no sense and just feels frustrating and cheap because it doesn't require you to react or dodge more, you just can't move out of the way of his attacks at that point but it's just dodging a tackle still). Like they took all the fun and complexity out of the actual Pokemon battles but the boss fights are a nightmare of poorly designed attacks to try to dodge while throwing balms. There are also a lot of small irritating things like 1 save file or how small the satchel is in a game where you're supposed to be constantly gathering things. The game is fun when you're just out catching Pokemon but it has a huge laundry list of problems that only Pokemon could ever get away with , like any other company or game series would be dragged for a game with this many issues and outdated systems.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

I played it and i was very surprised. Its the pokemon game we all wanted 10years ago but never too late i guess. Very addictive game, ive thoroughly enjoyed it, so much to do, could easily sink 100 hours in to it.

Negatives for me is the lack of online and the graphics, no voice acting and music. Also i think the battle system needs to move from turn based to more of a free moving system.

BlairPScott,05-02-2022,"After 58 hours, I finally finished the game fully - completing the Pokédex and facing the fight. Pokemon Legends Arceus has been a wild ride, a massive step forward for the series which I hope we see going forward. I’ve played every single Pokemon game since FRLG and grew up with the series and never felt more emboldened by it since then.

Catching Pokemon has never been easier yet still more in-depth, battles are fun and closer to what the anime portrays the world like. Full of environmental storytelling if you go looking for it and characters that you’ll recognise from other games but with little twists along the way by making use of it’s settings.

Legends Arceus also takes some more steps forward in terms of the behind the scenes mechanics that I think would be good to take forward into the future competitively and also makes it better for casual players by not punishing you too hard if you beat legendaries or rare spawns.

There’s some occasional pop in and sometimes the models look a bit slow when at a distance, but that’s been my only real problem with this game. But barring that, the gameplay loop is amazing and scarily addictive.

Katsumon,05-02-2022,"This game has a lot of what I've wanted from a Pokémon game. It's really good. It's like the devs came together and said ""We're tired of the complaints. Let's make a better Pokémon game."" It got lots of good stuff: a cool story, a fine collection of Pokémon, interesting characters, some mysteries to solve, excellent music, overdue quality of life changes, refined (and addictive) catching and battling mechanics, an interesting and sometimes beautiful world to explore... It's simply closer to the Pokémon game fans have wanted for decades. The graphics are mostly ok and can look good, and they certainly don't take anything away from the experience. They're just rough and there is pop-in and low-res textures. Most importantly though: it's a lot of fun.

The game clearly took some inspiration from Zelda: Breath of the Wild. But it simply lacks things that BotW got. And those are things it would need for a rating anywhere close to BotW. Things like better textures, voice acting, more modern graphics, larger/more detailed areas, more ruins and generally more to explore, more settlements and camps, Pokemon should be doing more than just walking around aimlessly and sleeping, dynamic weather affecting gameplay, better quests and side quests etc. The game is still too much fun for a 7/10 imo.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The gameplay, while different, is very fun and incentivizes using every Pokemon. The Pokemon finally have a variety of animations that gives them each so much personality, I found myself liking Pokemon I never thought twice about before. The catching mechanics are great and while the new battle mechanics are not ideal for competitive, they are welcome changes to switch things up.

readotjpg,02-02-2022,"My favourite Pokémon game ever. Legends: Arceus feels so refreshing after all the incredibly linear Pokémon games of the past. The wild area was a step in the right direction, but this is an entire leap. Some parts are still frustrating, like necessary 1v3 battles and repetitive star rank farming to progress, but even those aren't that bad. I can't think of anything off the top of my head that was added into this that is a noticeable downgrade from previous games.

I completely understand why some people might not like this game, which is completely fine, but I want to make it clear that I'm not praising the game just because so is (mostly) everyone else. I went into this with very little information. I didn't watch trailers, or other content about this before it was released. I was not very hyped for this game before I played it, but I very much enjoyed the experience. The game has been stuck in my mind every time I'm unable to play it, it always sticks in the back of my head. Waiting to get back home to play this has turned into a tradition for me at this point.

I'm not quite through this game yet, and I'm not a very critical person when it comes to media, but I still wanted to add my take on this. If you ask me, which you shouldn't, this game is definitely worth it. Especially if you're a Pokémon fan.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The « action » part of the game is a mix of the Pokémon Let’s go and « normal » franchises. I really go for a sneaky hunt of cute monsters. (The hit sound with you catch a Pokémon from behind is insanely addictive) I really feel like they (GameFreak) tried their best to provide us a living and refreshing game.

I really hope Gen 9 is similar to this with more emphasis on graphical fidelity and interacting with your Pokémon.,9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
TadaoKou,07-02-2022,"Well, normally I wouldn't give this game a 10/10 but an 8/10 but because there are so many morrons here which give the game a 0 or 3/10, I will give it a 10.
Giving this game just a 0 or a 3 or even a 5/10 is just objectivly not true, even if you dislike the game.

Now, where to start with this game...I personally absolutly adore it.
I have over 70 hours right now put into it and I think it is the best Pokemon game since Black & White. Personally I was never a fan of the 3D Pokemon games until Legends Arceus came out.

Now, I want to address the biggest issue people have first: The graphics.
The graphics are a 2 sided coin in this game. If you look at the game in TV mode, it looks terrible. Simply terrible. The performance in TV mode is also terrible. It often feels like a 20 FPS game.
But...if you look at this game in handheld mode, it can actually look really pretty in some parts. If you have the game already, just compare a run through Jubilife Village between the TV mode and the handheld mode.
You will notice that the handheld mode runs extremly well and looks really good in some areas.
But you will also notice that the TV mode is the opposite of that.
I would advise anyone to play this game ONLY in handheld mode! Personally, I can only say that this game is an 8/10 because I only played in handheld mode.
If I have to judge the game by it's TV mode, it would be a 4 or 5/10. That's how big the difference is.

Even despite me acknowledging the bad graphics in TV mode, I still think a lot of reviews here are extremly unfair towards the game. Calling Gamefreak lazy or terrible in this case is not true.
Pokemon Legends Arceus was clearly a passion project for Gamefreak. You can see it in a lot of details they put in the game. Especially Jubilife Village. That is probably the best Pokemon village or town we had since the games went 3D. There are so many small details put into Jubilife Village, it is insane.
For spoiler reasons I will not mention any. I will just say, this game was clearly a passion project for Gamefreak and even with flaws like the terrible TV mode, you can clearly see that they tried this time with the game.

I honestly want this to be the main take-away from anyone who reads this review:
The game is awesome if you play it as a handheld game.
But if you play it as a homeconsole game, it is mediocre at best.

I honestly would wish that Gamefreak just disabled the TV mode for this game and made it handheld only. Yes, people would still be angry about that but I think we would have way less people complaining about the graphics, if Gamefreak was just honest with their terrible TV mode.

It also sadly just shows me how the Switch in itself makes it hard to judge games.
Like I said, I give this game a 10/10 because morrons put negative reviews out which are WAY to negative for such an wellpolished handheld game.
On the other hand, I can understand those reviews if they only played in TV mode.
Like I said, I would personally give this game an 8/10 as a handheld game.
But as a homeconsole game, it's in the 3-5/10 area.

It also shows the duality of the Switch itself. The console itself is great but there are always set-backs which drag it down. We can clearly see it with other Switch games too.
For example: Breath of the Wild can sometimes have a bad performance if you play it in TV mode. But in handheld mode, it's completly fine.

Now, I didn't really talk about gameplay or story or anything like that because...I think it is quite clear that I enjoyed the gameplay in itself if I would give this game an 8 or 10/10.
About the story...I really liked some of the characters. They are not great, but entertaining enough.
The story in itself is good, but not great. It more or less is just an excuse to send you running through the world.
In general, this game is extremly gameplay focused and I really don't want to say anything about that because there are a lot of surprises here. It is not comparable to previous Pokemon games, that much is clear.
But in my opinion, Gamefreak should continue going in the ""Legends"" direction.
If the next Legends game is not on the Switch or on an more powerful Switch, we might even get a game with a working handheld AND TV-mode!

Gonna add one thing here:
People who give this game 0 or 3/10 are objectivly wrong. Even if the graphics were as terrible as everyone said (which they are only for TV mode and even than, it could be way worse), this game is objectivly not a Zero.
Morrons like that should honestly stop playing Pokemon in general. Why? Because disencouraging Gamefreak now with bad review scores is REALLY not the thing we need now.
I don't say just blindly applaud them but if people continue to hate on this game, we will just get the same old terrible Pokemon formula again.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Jorgeranio,06-02-2022,"Un juego de 10, con muchas cosas buenas que debe de seguir la saga en futuros juegos... el gameplay, aún siendo repetitivo es muy adictivo, aunque tiene fallos grandes como los gráficos o mecánicas simples. Va haciendo falta doblaje en los juegos de pokémon para dar más inmersión en su historia, sobre todo en escenas importantes o cinemáticas que se puedan hacer pesadas.
Si bien es cierto que los modelos y animaciones están más trabajados, creo que el poco tiempo ha hecho que otras cosas queden sin pulir y generen problemas visuales bastantes importantes... En la historia no me voy a meter, no hace falta que sea buena o mala cuando queda en segundo plano, aunque en términos generales tienen diálogos más profundos, que como he dicho antes, mejorarían bastante con un doblaje acorde.

The graphics are something that can always be improved upon but we are dealing with the 5 year old console switch graphical capabilities. There are occasional glitches but they are few far in between and doesn’t affect the playability.

The Game-play is immersive, fun and addictive, fully-fledged into an open-world format that feels very refined and fresh, and can be taken as very close to what fans have always wanted.
The Soundtrack is one of the best OSTs Pokemon has ever received. The Graphics lack, but by no means bad, even grand in many places.

AyZix6,06-02-2022,"FINALLY A FUN POKÉMON GAME! After years of stale games, Pokémon finally changed their formula, and for the better. The concept may not sound too interesting at first, but building your own team has never been this fun. I’d even go as far as saying that the game gets better and better as you progress. Zones get bigger, Pokémon get smarter, and you can finally assemble the team with the Pokémon you want. I’ve always wanted an alakazam in my team and was limited by the outdated trade mechanic, but now I can finally use one! How refreshing. This game would be a 10/10 if it wasn’t for the graphics. I am especially disspointed by a certain aquatic zone that looks completely hideous and that I rushed through to get to the next zone. Luckily, the zone following was way better looking and fun. I also don’t like the water mechanic very much. I think it’s way less fun to go catch Pokémon in the water than on land. The story is ok, nothing special but it’s not necessarily bad. No voice acting also kinda makes you cringe along the weird animations during the cutscenes. Some lag here and there but nothing that will alter the gameplay. The difficulty of the game is quite easy, (if sword and shield were a 1 and dark souls were a 10 this would be a 2 or 3) but you can also choose to fight Pokémon that are much stronger than your team and try to catch them, which adds optional difficulty. Overall, amazing game, mediocre graphics considering BOTW had a similar style and looked miles better despite coming out 5 years prior. This is a game where gameplay is everything and the rest is pretty much just there to be functional.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Dangusse,14-11-2022,"completely rushed. it has some cool aspects to it, especially if you want to use it for shiny hunting, but the boss battles are all terrible, the ride pokemon function worse than 20+ year old games, and the graphics are become laughably bad, down to 1fps 2d sprites at like 30 yards away. the game is extremely imbalanced and has extremely clunky mechanics and slow/boring quests that again are worse than games from when i was a sperm cell. this is not pokemon botw, it's a cash grab. it's shameful how small and empty the settlements are, as well as general move speed while walking being weird and uncomfortable - i have to click the left stick at all times in order to move faster than a snail? i have to constantly switch ride pokemon every 2 seconds, and if you use the braviary you are more than likely to instantly die on your first try because of how unacceptably bad the controls and it's movement are.

i can't stress enough that this game has potential, but it barely feels like pokemon. i dont even look at what pokemon im using because the battles are all 1hkos that last 2 seconds, and this plus the extremely broken jet balls made it far too easy to get to max level very fast. critics are lying, fans who say it's good are either highly impressionable or have not made it far enough into the game to see how much of a leaky bucket the mid to late game experience is. also, almost all of the new pokemon variants appear to be trash in combat and many of them have very underwhelming design and backstory.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The store is a joke, you'll never actually have to buy a pokeball or potion for the entirety of the game

The lack of other villages or towns in the game is pretty horrendous. Only another village and yet nothing worthwhile to the storyline to do there.

As other critics have mentioned, the NPCs are also blatantly empty.

To me the only worthwhile point to this game is the storyline and even there they could've cut to the chase at the end instead of adding double and triple plot twists!

Completed the game and tossed it in my completed game section. May or may not take it out for DLCs if any in the future but it really feels like DLCs should have been part of the game in the first place.

Borrow it from a friend, complete the story and don't bother complete the pokedex, buying stuff or doing side quests. They give little to no addition to the game",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

LeMauro,02-02-2022,"English:
Pokémon Legends Arceus, is the best Pokémon game since Black 2 and White 2.
I'm not saying it's ""a masterpiece"", but it does a lot of what was asked for.

This game has the premise of ""Gotcha Them All"", and it succeeds, you have to search every corner, cross sky and sea, everything to have them all, being the Pokémon game that we always wanted from the beginning.

The game in many moments gives you the feeling of total freedom, being able to go to almost any corner that is shown on the map.

Even if it complies with everything, it is not perfect, being often mediocre.

The controls are very good, they respond perfectly, and the vibration gives it the touch.
But the pokemon Braviary, has a rough control and is very difficult to control at times.

The music is quite good when exploring, I even had to stop to enjoy it in an instant, but the music of the fights is the same all the time, almost all pokemon games are the same in this regard, but when the coach's music is also repeated without changing no more than 2 times, it ends up tiring.

The story takes a long time to start, but when it does, it ends up capturing you with the expectation of knowing what is coming, but unfortunately, it ends very suddenly, and the game never gives room for unknowns.

This as much as I can share, I hope it helps you when deciding whether to buy the game.

Español:
Pokémon Legends Arceus, es el mejor juego de Pokémon desde Black 2 y White 2.
No digo que sea ""una obra maestra"", pero hace mucho de lo que se pedía.

Este juego tiene como premisa ""Gotcha Them All"", y lo consigue, hay que buscar en todos los rincones, cruzar cielo y mar, todo para tenerlos a todos, siendo el juego de Pokémon que siempre quisimos desde un principio.

El juego en muchos momentos te da la sensación de total libertad, pudiendo ir a casi cualquier rincón que se muestra en el mapa.

Aunque cumple con todo, no es perfecto, siendo muchas veces mediocre.

Los controles son muy buenos, responden a la perfección, y la vibración le da el toque.
Pero el pokemon Braviary, tiene un control tosco y es muy difícil de controlar en ocasiones.

La música es bastante buena a la hora de explorar, incluso tuve que parar para disfrutarla en un instante, pero la música de las peleas es la misma todo el tiempo, casi todos los juegos de pokemon son iguales en ese sentido, pero cuando la música del entrenador es tambien repetido sin cambiar no mas de 2 veces, termina cansando.

La historia tarda mucho en comenzar, pero cuando lo hace, termina capturándote con la expectativa de saber lo que viene, pero lamentablemente termina muy repentinamente, y el juego nunca da lugar a incógnitas.

Esto es todo lo que puedo compartir, espero que te ayude a la hora de decidir si comprar el juego.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

StrickenLoki92,08-02-2022,"Despite the world not being fully open (Nothing wrong but BOTW is fully open with better drawing distances) and draw distance being terrible, legends arceus is the best pokemon game I've played in a LONG time (Since Gen 5) it has TONS of content (More than we are used to sadly, but nothing compared to other RPGS like skyrim and such), story is fairly long I didn't rush and it took me around 50 hours I would like to see the same game, but in Jhoto with access to the Kanto region and the FULL national dex! (Not a modern Jhoto nor ancient Jhoto, regular gen 2 Jhoto couple of cities multiple towns with huge routes to catch pokemon), Still playing the game haven't fully captured all legendaries and i'm at 72 hours but already finished main story and post game story only missing secondary missions.

DaLawUK,02-02-2022,"So we finally have a game that Gamefreak have put some effort in, however does it actually work? Minor spoilers if you haven't watched trailers so be warned.

So my first sitting I sat there for 9 hours straight giving this an honest go so I can put together a fair review. I played it all on stream and said my pros and cons there but here they are in text for others to read and decide on if they want to purchase. I have now put in 35 hours I can put together a fair review.

Overall, Yes this game is worth and I am very impressed Gamefreak took this risk and I hope future games use this type of system. There are some things they could have done better which I'll go into first Pokémon at night could have more of a variety, every map has 80% of the same Pokémon at night except a few that are exclusive to that map at night. It's most driffloons you find which is annoying, but during the day there's a variety on each map. It's only at night it's lacking.

Some side quests need some work, they need to be more descriptive or give you the maps name at least. Some of them give you a quest where you have to go an area but that name isn't on any map at all, someone would have mentioned the name but you'd have to remember.

The map needs more little towns for immersivness, you have people coming from other existing places to your town. However you never actually find those towns, instead of having random quests on the maps to pick up you could have little towns you go pick them up from and then you could learn a little more of how those places operate at the same time. Except you just hear of all the places and never get to see them which is a shame.

Pokémon in the wild could have behaviour characteristics, get too close to another Pokémon they could argue with each other or even fight, Have bidoofs collecting wood to make dams, Beatifly landing on trees and sucking the nectar. Just things to give the Pokémon more life, they do go to sleep at night (If they don't despawn and get replaced with night Pokémon which does happen).

Now on to why it's such a great game.

System.. The open world style really suits this game and it's a huge step forwards for the franchise. Being able to choose to try and catch a Pokémon right away or battle it is great.. what's even better is being able to move while battling. This doesn't do anything but it lets you look around and if you annoy more than one Pokémon you can end up battling as many enemies that are around you.

Crafting.. Now this actually lets you do something with the open world style. Collect materials which you can find on the ground or get as rewards for catching/fainting pokemon. You might think it's a tedious thing but you don't need to craft you can just smash through the content however crafting does add a little more to do for those that like this type of thing. Collecting recipes and crafting those new recipe's to make fights easier in the future.

Mounts.. You can run fast, break stuff, swim or fly and you can switch between them whenever you want with the D-Pad and if your currently on your running mount and go into water it will automatically switch to your swimming mount. Great addition Gamefreak, well done. However I wish you could actually fly around and fight flying Pokémon in the sky.

Danger.. Now you can actually faint from Pokémon attacking you. This could do with being harder though it is very easy to dodge Pokémon attacks or get away from them. However the fear of you actually fainting and loosing items you went out and crafted/bought is a cool addition to the game. Alpha Pokémon are a great addition too. You can litterally throw your Pokémon out anywhere and call them back, so you catch an alpha Pokémon you can compare it's size to a regular one. You have a choice to either fight the wild Pokémon or catch them right off the bat. Even aggressive Pokémon can be approached with the correct items, I've caught about 10 Alpha Pokémon without battling them.

The side quests are both great and have their flaws at the same time. Most of the side quests have different styles quests, have a little story too them too but then around 1/5th side quests are just 'Fill X Pokemons Dex entry'. Which is too many in my opinion, your planning to finish all Dex entries anyway if you want the reward.

Overall this game is a hard 9/10 I love that Gamefreak went for a risk and put so much effort into a new game rather than us getting a new 3DS game that's slightly bigger in map size. This is a great direction for new Pokémon games, I see this as the BoTW of the series. This is a test to see if the audience enjoy this style of game and then in future we will get more immersive maps, maps will towns we are going to end up having a truly flawless game if they continue in this direction and don't just use this style of spin off games in the future.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
yascm,08-02-2022,"Este juego es absolutamente renovador, tiene algunos detalles a mi parecer en cuanto a la dinámica, por ejemplo para moverse entre zonas no te da opción de ir libremente sino que hablas con el personaje de salida, le indicas la zona y en automático llegas. Como es un juego que te incita a la exploración, se contradice un poco en ese sentido. Por lo demás estoy muy contento, es el juego que estaba esperando desde que tenía 10 años y compré el pokémon yellow para game boy color.

UltanCombo,08-02-2022,"This is the best Pokemon game Ive ever experienced. They have defiantly have taken some inspiration from Breath of the Wild and have listened to the fans. Sword and Shield was a joke. After ten minuets of that game I hated it but this is totally different. There isn't enough hours in the day to play this.

I grew up with Pokemon. I watched the series, some of the movies, played Blue, Gold, Crystal, Ruby and unfortunately Shield. Those games had something new to them in each iteration. Gold had a better progression system. There isn't a huge jump in power levels like there is in Blue. Ruby is probably the tightest Pokemon game I played for a while but when Shield came out I was expecting what Arceus is offering here but we got a rehash of what we've been getting for the last 20 years.

This game looks like its in early development or its a proof of concept. Its poor and they need to get some high level talent at Nintendo to bring this to the next level. But the pokemon look good and the moves look even better. It leaves me confused how doing up some environmental textures could be so hard. The lighting is fine but its more a texture issue. The environment doesn't really match the style of the pokemon. Its odd. And you dont really have a sense where you are cause its all kinda samey. Unless your near a waterfall or a beach or something you can use as some kind of landmark. This needs improvements but we're close to getting that game we always wanted.

As for gameplay wise its pretty good. I have little issue with the gameplay. Its still turn based and you share exp but its harder still. The pop in and pop out is ridiculous. You could be chasing down a pokemon and then all of a sudden POP it goes away. This needs fixing. In the early 00's its fine but not anymore. The lack of or more the point, the absence of voice over is jarring. Still stuck in the 90's with the text for speech. Pokemon is one of the biggest franchises in the world, they have enough for a voice over budget.

Im giving this an EIGHT cause I'm so happy playing this. It has plenty of issues that it really should be a SIX but the nostalgia is strong with this one.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Yukowrath,02-02-2022,"For me, this is the second best entry into the Pokemon series. Although, as a disclaimer, I've only played each of the mainline games and remakes (and Let's go, if that counts as a separate thing). Arceus has been my absolute favourite since I played Blue for the first time in the 90s and this new game was beaten out by nostalgia and fond memories only to be honest.

The minimalistic art style is reminiscent of older Japanese artwork; it's a beautiful and moving take on simplistic world that supports the engaging core mechanics. It's true that it's not as beautiful as some more recent games, however for me it is clear that this is not what Arceus sets out to be.

When we talk about open world games, the narrative often becomes about that world and the interactions with that world by the character and story; Arceus doesn't set out to have you move mountains within the world but instead exist as a part of a theorised greater whole. Much like the thesis of the game's story: how do we exist as humans within this greater world filled with potentially terrifying Pokemon who are by default stronger than we are? The game asks who are we compared to each other and who are we compared to these creatures, rather than who are we compared to the world. For me, the beauty is further than skin deep and the graphical minimalism of the world supports this greatly.

Arceus gives a stage to often lesser used Pokemon, it asks you to think about your Pokemon journey further than 'Who is the strongest?', and it puts the exploration and mystery back in the genre.

I loved it and I sincerely hope they produce more in this vein. Highly recommend.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

PoCra,02-02-2022,"This Game. I love this Game, it's now my favorite Pokémon game. I like, the world building and the chosen Pokémon for the areas they are great and makes sense. Some people don't like that the Pokémon have fixed spots where they can spawn, but I like it. That way, it isn't so difficult to fill the Pokédex. I especially like that you need to do different things to complete the Pokédex entree, it's refreshing new. At all, the new concept is something what Pokémon really needed. This is the first important step. But hopefully not the last step. There are many things to improve. Especially the graphics and the distant view. But for people who don't care about graphics, only about the game-play, this is a great game. There aren't very much fights, but there are some, what I like. But this I can totally understand, this game plays in a time when it isn't so common that everyone has Pokémon. The most fights are easy but sometimes there are hard fights especially in the after story. About the Boss Pokémon of the games, I like that concept. Some of them are really easy, especially the first, but not all. Two of them were really hard and by one of them I have died two times. Which don't sound like much, but I play very much dark souls and in this game it is especially important to dodge, and the dodge role of PLA is exactly the same as there. During the role, you are for a short time invincible if you dodge exactly when the enemy is attacking. Overall I like this game, it is great and does very much fun.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

samichsupernova,08-02-2022,"I wasn’t sure what to make of PL:Arceus when it was first announced. On the one hand, GF and TPC appeared to be changing up the battle mechanics & adding real-time elements. On the other hand, its poor graphics and empty overworld left a lot to be desired. It was also unclear whether the game would be an experimental one-off, or an attempt to change/evolve the series’ core mechanics. As someone who’s played since the very first titles but finds the latest entries to be stale and disappointing, I went in with very low expectations.

Pokemon Legends: Arceus’ trailers promised a decent story, and while I can attest that the writing receives more focus than usual, the presentation frankly sucks, as there’s still no voice acting, with most interactions consisting of characters awkwardly standing & talking.

The real draws are the revamped combat and catching systems. The changes to gameplay, while not perfect, make Arceus initially far more captivating than its preceding games. First and most importantly, you can aim Poke Balls to interact directly with Pokemon on the field, & while exploring, you’ll be able to easily shuffle who’s next in line to battle, as well as send them to harvest materials from trees, shrubs, and mineral outcroppings, essential for crafting healing items and Poke Balls.

Many Pokemon will either run or attack your avatar on sight, so you’ve got options - dodge like it's Dark Souls, sneak around and try to nab them without being spotted, ambush with your Pokemon to start a fight, lure/repel them with food, or run away. You’ll also get multiple Pokemon mounts to ride across the game’s several open areas.

Combat is tweaked in many minor ways. While you’ll be dodging occasionally, aside from bosses, you don’t fight Pokemon in real-time, so the traditional four-move, turn-based core combat remains. The game introduces Agile and Strong variations to attacks (faster and weaker VS stronger and slower). Best of all, your Pokemon’s moves can now be easily switched outside of battle, making it infinitely more convenient to swap movesets. It really opens up a lot of possibilities - you can have your starter be a sweeper in one battle, and a defensive mon-catching tool in the next. Held items no longer exist. Status effects are tweaked, with most being weaker, and they thankfully disappear after each battle.

These changes, as well as the limited pool of teachable moves, make certain builds, such as dedicated physical and special sweepers, far more effective. It’ll be in your interest to get battles done as quickly as possible, especially since you’ll often find yourself fighting multiple wild Pokemon at once with just one of your own. For the most part, the changes also help the game to flow smoother, since you’ll be covering a lot of ground in the great outdoors, often atop mounted Pokemon. However, due to the kneecapping of potential builds owing to the removal of breeding, and lack of variety in your foes making fine-tuning an afterthought, I grew bored of the battles halfway in.

There are no gyms, no breeding, and very few trainer battles. Instead, you’ll spend time gathering/crafting, and on the Pokedex. This time your dex entries don’t end with just catching and trading. You’re also tasked with specific battle tasks. You’ll only need to fulfill ten challenges per Pokemon, so while it isn't daunting, it does feel like busywork.

That brings me to the game’s biggest weakness - the world itself - and I don’t just mean the fact that there are limited ways to interact with the environments, or that the 242 Pokemon are a mixed bag of species. While the Pokemon models are often well-animated, the day-night and weather cycles add variety, and the game runs smoothly with minimal loading, there’s no sugarcoating the fact that the graphics and environments are subpar, featuring empty worlds, trees & textures that would look bad on the GameCube, pop-in and heavy aliasing, & a bland color palette tempered by muted art direction.

It's a testament to the strength of Arceus’ core mechanics that the bland environments, lack of trainer battles, and unfinished feel of the game don’t completely sink the experience. Perhaps it’s because my expectations were so low going in, but I can safely say that in spite of its many faults, Arceus is the most fun I’ve had with a Pokemon title since the days of the DS. It also shows that the franchise in general still has potential. That may sound like faint praise from someone who has been critical of the mainline franchise for years, but I think most fans will appreciate the real-time elements, the easily-swappable movesets, and the additions to the world-building and lore. My only hope is that Nintendo is able to build upon what was established in this title and utilize it to take the franchise forward in a bold new direction. Rated 4/10 to balance out all the shills.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Patrick95,02-02-2022,"Let's say is a good experiment but... The battles are a mess. Little amount, you can avoid almost any battle you want... Doesn't make any sense. It's Pokémon GO all over again. You catch them all and that's all, you don't need to train them because even bosses can be beaten without even using a single Pokémon. And the joke is that they all are wining experience even if you didn't use them.

Battle system is a mess and left so much to be desired like: enemy pokemon is poisoned, I use calm mind to buff myself for the next Pokémon, their pokemon use agile style and attack, their pokemon die to poison and another comes in, new pokemon uses quick attack, new pokemon uses agile style attack, new pokemon attacks again and when my turn is finally here... Calm mind effect expired. A joke. I understand now why there's no held items or abilities. They surely need to improve this in future games.

Also story is bland, the postgame is epic, but doesn't makes much sense and... The tutorial is the longest this franchise has. Don't get me wrong I liked the game, because catching and exploring are done better than ever and that makes this game really fun to play! It's by far the best part of this game. But the rest is just... Meh.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC
DbMixolydian,06-02-2022,"Pokemon Legends was an extreme disappointment for me. I was super hyped for this game as a lifelong Pokemon fan, but also as an RPG fan. This game fell short of my expectations in several different categories.

Firstly, the combat feels horrible to me. They revamped the stats and combat system for Pokemon Legends, but it doesn't feel good. Every move hits so hard, and you will often lose several Pokemon battling a wild Pokemon. You will almost always lose a few when fighting an Alpha Pokemon or a Noble Pokemon. A lot of people seem to think this makes the game more challenging, but to me it just made it more frustrating. I still never blacked out or lost my entire party, I just had to craft a boatload of revives and potions after each fight.

In addition to this, they removed abilities from the game and instead added ""Agile"" and ""Strong"" style moves. You can use agile to perform and weaker attack, or strong for the opposite. While this seems cool in theory, battles rarely ever last long enough to reward using agile style. I personally feel like abilities made Pokemon more unique and provided for a more interesting combat experience. Overall, I tried to avoid encounters with wild Pokemon and catch them without entering combat if possible.

Secondly, the story blows. One of the main appeals to most RPGs is their stories. The Witcher, Skyrim, Horizon Zero Dawn, etc. all have deep stories with plenty of twists and turns that keep you engaged. The story in Pokemon Legends is extremely vague and offers very little conclusion even upon full completion. You're basically a kid who fell through a space-time distortion into ancient Sinnoh where Pokemon are going crazy. Upon completion of the story and the entire Pokedex, you still haven't figured out who you are and why you fell through the space-time rift to begin with.

Third, calling this an ""open-world RPG"" is laughable. The game is extremely linear and you are bound to certain areas until you complete the main quest. This isn't like Skyrim, Fallout, or Breath of the Wild where you can freely go where you please and complete the story how you like. There are no meaningful choices involved at all. You can explore the areas you've unlocked to your heart's content, but there aren't really any side stories or anything. The world is bland and lacks depth. There aren't any cool puzzles or hidden areas to discover. Ultimately, this just felt like a different take on the existing Pokemon games. It certainly didn't feel like the revolutionary open-world RPG that it was hyped up to be.

Lastly, I tried not to judge this game too harshly off of graphics and performance, but unfortunately, it is impossible to overlook that aspect of the game. This game plays and looks worse than Skyrim, a 2011 game. There are FPS drops that make the game laggy and feel bad regardless of whether you play handheld or docked. I know the Switch isn't a very powerful system, but it sure ran Breath of the Wild a heck of a lot better.

Overalll, I think Pokemon Legends is a cool idea with awful execution. While it was enjoyable at times (especially in the beginning) doing the same thing over and over got old pretty fast. This game feels close to being something awesome but falls short in way too many crucial areas for me to warrant giving it more than a 3 or a 4 at best.

The story is decent, the controls nice and the pokémon don't seem AS bland as they were in previous Pokémon Titles. It is fun! BUT as a fan of the series for 20+ years i can not ignore the many inconsistencies (NPCs sometimes moving their mouth while talking, and sometimes not for e.g.), the uninspired landscapes (and caves specifically), the horrific graphics (especially light and shadow work and lilac shimmer on the ground for no apparent reason) and framerate, the annoying repetitive dialogue, the pokémon glitching up trees and the jokingly bad render distances of a MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY in the year 2022. The Gameplay however is really fun, not perfect but fun and i really hope the next legends game will improve the things it clearly lacks as off right now. Great potential",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

veedub,02-02-2022,"This game is incredible. I've been so addicted to it since I got it. I remember as a kid playing outside with my friends like we were Pokemon trainers . . . Pokemon Legends Arceus is exactly what I envisioned playing Pokemon should be like.

They seem to have actually considered the kind of game that people want when they think of playing Pokemon. Exploring, finding them in their natural habitats, and everything is just quick and fluid. The gameplay loop of explore/catch/rework team is super refined and I'm almost sad that we didn't get a Pokemon game like this much, much earlier.

It's not all perfect though. GameFreak simply doesn't allocate nearly enough budget for their game development. As a result, this game visually looks like it could have been on the Wii. There was basically no budget for cinematics and so there's so much stuff that is expressed in text that characters are doing but it just goes to a black screen because they didn't actually animate that. (You know, you'd think a franchise that has one of the most popular and long-running TV series to go with it would have the budget to do that? Not to mention voice acting and orchestrated soundtrack -- which obviously they have for the TV series).

But enough of the bad. This game is easily not only the pinnacle of the series as a whole, but a game that nostalgia put aside deserves the records and accolades it is getting.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Ben3033,06-02-2022,"At first sight, Pokemon Legends: Arceus seems to be the game fans have been pleading about for all these years: an open world game where you can freely explore the lands and fight Pokemon. In a way, that is true, but the execution was very flawed. The game is restricted to zones, otherwise known as an ""open-zone"" game. This was a disappointment, especially when the earlier trailers made it out to be a game similar to BOTW. Not only that, but the game restricts you from entering certain areas of zones if you haven't filled out enough of the Pokedex. However, this shouldn't be too much of an issue, as long as you are doing more than just following the missions.

The main gameplay loop is very fun. Being able to explore freely(in the zones of course) and catch, fight, or run away from Pokemon doesn't get old... well at least for most of the game. It starts to tedious after a while, especially because it's REQUIRED to access certain areas.

The Pokemon don't do anything interesting; they are completely lifeless. They either walk around, sleep, or occasionally teleport depending on the Pokemon. Why not have some Pokemon fight with each other occasionally, or have two Pikachu's touching their tails as a greeting(which is quite literally in their Pokedex entry), stuff like that which would make the world feel more active. The zones themselves are bare-boned, with only the most basic terrain. Not to mention, the graphics are awful for a 2022 Nintendo Switch game. The terrain looks worse than games on the GameCube.

When you aren't following the main story or exploring the world for fun, you're probably doing Requests, otherwise known as sidequests. These sidequests are the most basic, boring, and tedious tasks you can think of. They're all the same; catch a specific Pokemon, fill out a specific Pokemon's Pokedex entry, or collect a certain amount of an item to bring back to the requester. It felt like doing homework going through these. However, there are a couple of fun ones. One of them, you get to catch a shiny Ponyta. But like I said, there are only a COUPLE of these. It feels like the developers were asked to make a sidequest system last minute, so they had to rush like 100 of them and made them all practically the same thing.

There IS a story, but it's pretty awful. Every cutscene is just two or more characters staring at eachother with 0 sound effects or voice acting, and these cutscenes happen ALL. THE. F****ING. TIME. The tutorial of the game is like an hour long and you are CONSTANTLY being interrupted whenever you get a chance to actually do something. These interruptions are not as frequent as the tutorial throughout the rest of the game, but that isn't saying much.

TL;DR: Pokemon Legends: Arceus has a great concept, but it's incredibly obvious Game Freak half-assed many things. It's not truly open-world, and the restrictions placed upon you really take away a lot of the fun you could have. However, despite all of this, the gameplay loop is still incredibly addicting and fun to the point where this game deserves a 7. I hope we get more games like this in the future in which all the issues are ironed out, because this game really had potential.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
bulba2020think,11-02-2022,"PLA is a fun game that is really rough around the edges. There are parts of the game that make me kinda want the game to get on with it and parts where I was actually engaged with the story. With that said the game play felt very bare-bones and repetitive making me wish that there was more to it.

Story: 7
For a Pokemon game, the story in this one is actually pretty decent even though I feel they had to use leaps in logic for why people act or why conflict sometimes happen in order to progress the story forward, which isn't a bad thing, just isn't groundbreaking in its own right. Just happy to have stakes in a Pokemon game again.

Sound: 6
There wasn't much music that really stood out to me mostly because I swear i couldn't hear it over
the Pokemon in the wild, the ending song is really good though.

Graphics: 5
I agree with everyone else that the graphics of the game itself isn't really that good and for the largest media franchise in the world, they could have stepped them up. But at the end of the day, it could have been a lot worse than we actually got.

Game play: 6
The game play is fun at the beginning, but the main issue with it is the fact that it's pretty much the same thing throughout the entire game, with the only break in the monotony being the boss fights which were genuinely fun to fight against because it wasn't just a regular Pokemon battle.

Final Score: 6/10
PLA is a step in the right direction for the Pokemon franchise, and I really want to see what they do next with this type of game play style. Even if this instalment feels extremely bare currently.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

FestiveBoi,02-02-2022,"This is easily one of the best Pokemon games since Pokemon Black and White era.

It's a breath of fresh air for the Pokemon series, and having the ability to be able to roam around to catch new Pokemon, experience new little details that were added to the game. The tutorial, whilst a little too long for my liking, still teaches you all the ropes of the game, and once you get over that, it's no longer the hand-holding game that has been the previous games.

Being able to ignore the main story for hours on end, just so you can explore and experience new areas, Pokemon and witness them with sentience is something else that is amazing.

The battle system has been reworked, and it will take a little bit to get used to. However, once you get the ropes of the battle system, along with Strong and Agile style moves, lots of great strategies can be born. And, once you master the battle system, it will be extremely fun to play around with, using moves that you might've not before, and using strategies that you would have never even thought of.

The dark theme of the game overall, with death, mauling, and having the fear of Pokemon struck into your heart when they attack you in the wild, and you must run away, and fear for your life as they chase you down. It's a step toward something great. Pokemon aren't just creatures that will do a trainers bidding, they were once wild, untamed and it shows in this era of Pokemon that they possessed a true threat to humankind.

The graphics are a little off... but who plays Pokemon for the graphics? It's all about the creatures, and catching them all, which is desperately needed in this game to actually complete it.

Overall, Pokemon Legends Arceus is a very fun, and addicting game. The music in the background as you explore is something that can easily be enjoyed. The gameplay loop is incredibily enjoyable for those that are completionists, and want to 100% complete a game. It certainly is a step in the right direction for the Pokemon company, and this is a great, solid baseline for future games.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The first 2 hours were a pain in the ass and I feel like they guide the player so much, it's infuriating. I'd prefer it if the game let you learn a lot more by yourself. The mechanics aren't complicated at all so there's no need to explain everything like it's the first time I'm playing a video game in my life.

The combat system is fluid and you can enter a fight beat a pokemon and then start doing something else right after. The only compaint would be that it's lacking a bit. You can't summon more than one pokemon at the time, but you can fight against four. If there was a way to summon more pokemon at the time or if the attacks could hit multiple targets it would be better. Something interesting is the fact that you don't have to fight a pokemon every 5 seconds. If you prefer to, you can almost play the entier game by just catching pokemons and gathering ressources.

I'd really like to have a sequel with better graphics and polished mechanics. That's pretty much all it needs to be rated 10/10",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
ribeye2065,02-02-2022,"For everyone complaining about the visuals and graphics apparently don't remember that this game is coming at one of the most critically low points for Pokemon Co and Gamefreak.
If the game is too graphical and has no substance, they are torn for laziness in gameplay. If the game has tons of content, but no graphics - they are torn for laziness in graphical fidelity.

This game's graphics are - enough - to make this a highly successful look into what could become another mainline adventure game in the series.
If you take the core component out of the game, the Pokemon, this is still a very well upheld adventure game in its own right.

This game has so many FIRSTS for the series, it's unreal.

This is the first Pokemon game where I feel like bringing the whole concept of Pokemon - GOTTA CATCH EM ALL - really is the idea that drives this game forward. This is the first game where I feel that Pokemon are actually magical, beautiful, and dangerous creatures. ""Never run into the tall grass without a Pokemon to defend you"" - the mantra that is hounded at the intro of EVERY SINGLE GAME TO THIS POINT is actually felt. Being chased by a LIGHTNING CAT would be absolutely terrifying if you were alone. This game makes you actually feel like you are one of the first people to tame a wild, weird, and wonderful world filled realistically with Pokemon.

In short - Pokemon never has, and never will be, the pinnacle of graphical innovation - what this game does and shows is that you can have a whole lot of fun with being a lean, mean, Pokeball and food throwing machine - with enough world and graphics to satisfy the itch for a long time to come.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
NoahPKR,02-02-2022,"I’ll start with the bad. While the gameplay has evolved, the methods of story delivery have not changed a bit since the days of the DS - lots of reading and one big climactic fully rendered cut scene. In this fully expansive 3D world, 85% of the story is still dull cutscenes with text box after text box and no voice acting. While this isn’t inherently bad, nothing interesting is provided to keep your attention. The animation and rigging is downright lazy at times and the human character expressions / movement are uncanny despite their brilliant designs. Every time you interact with a human, it shatters the immersion as they play back the same 3 basic movements. The story itself is decent but is hidden behind layers of “telling instead of showing”, ie black screens and sounds to imply something is happening. I find myself just pressing the B button in rapid succession to get back to the actual fun parts. The graphics are the next gripe. It genuinely looks like a Wii game or older and it doesn’t seem that Gamefreak developers had the time to truly optimize this game for the system it’s on. My girlfriend who doesn’t play video games at all commented that it “looks like an old game” the first time she saw me play it. Optimizing takes time, so it seems they just dialed down the graphics to focus on other more important things. While the game looks great sometimes and the 3D models are beautifully designed, the graphics cannot be overlooked. Ugly textures, objects randomly clipping through each other, character details like hair are flat and lifeless, hovering 6 inches above the ground in some areas, you get it. Now, here’s where the game get literally everything else right. My first Pokémon game was Pokémon Diamond, and this is the most fun I’ve had playing a Pokémon game since then. The core gameplay is downright addicting, as the act of sneaking up on Pokémon, learning their behavior, stunning them with items, choosing when to battle is just… chefs kiss. It really feels like you’re in the world of Pokémon, running around just catching the little guys like you always wanted to as a kid. The wild battles are high stakes a lot of the time, as it only takes one alpha Pokémon to knock out your whole team. I found myself feeling genuine terror the first time I saw that alpha Rapidash, something that is MORE than welcome in a Pokémon game. In this regard, it’s everything you could want until that pesky story gets in the way. It’s easy to spend hours upon hours just filling out research tasks. It’s a huge JUMP in the right direction for Pokémon, as the old battle mechanics ran their course over a decade ago.

It’s also exceedingly clear that this game is Gamefreak’s love letter to sinnoh, from the music, placement of landmarks and overall design of the wild areas. It’s really fun to feel like you’re exploring the past version of the region you explored as a kid. The moment you realize you’re in Eterna Forest or one of the legendary lakes, with the music to boot, is second to none. You won’t enjoy this game nearly as much if you don’t have the nostalgic ties to Sinnoh. Overall, while this game definitely drops the ball in a lot of areas, it picks it up and runs with it in so many others. I’ve had hours upon hours of genuinely bewildering experiences playing this game, just by running around and catching Pokémon the way The Lor-Arceus intended. The gameplay is second to none, and it’s a shame that Gamefreak didn’t get the proper time to see this game all of the way through.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Dant00ine,06-02-2022,"Really let down by the gaming community’s inability to give objective reviews.

I was excited about this game from the moment I heard about it a year ago. I really wanted to like it, but as I watched it go through development I saw red flag after red flag.

The game seems to suffer from lazy open-world design syndrome; where the illusion of endless opportunity boils down to reveal a game void of meaningful content with redundant and scarce gameplay loops.

Seeing the Pokémon in the overworld, having more control over the trainer and their poke-balls, these are great ideas that get people excited. But think about how much is missing; look at the legendary open world games like TES, GTA, and BotW. These games have their base gameplay loops (slinging swords and sorcery, stealing cars) but they come together to support epic overarching stories: guilds, colorful characters, impactful decisions.

I had a lot of fun with Pokémon let’s go, and a lot of people complained about that. I think both the games suffer from a lot of the same problems. Hasty development, lazy and uninspired UI, technical issues we didn’t see in their predecessors. But where are the negative reviews for legends? I wanted to like Arceus, but this game clearly didn’t get the budget it would have taken to properly pull off this really great idea. Imagine: guild plotlines like from TES, but you’re working your way up through gyms, saving Pokémon as a ranger, or refining your Pokémon as a breeder. Imagine colorful characters sending you on meaningful adventures and becoming your companions! But no, we get a super boiled down game that feels like one or two years of development work from the B-team.

Come on gaming community… tell me with a straight face this is Pokémon breath of the wild… that’s just insulting to the team who put together the masterpiece that is botw. It’s like saying a Honda with a spoiler is the Japanese Ferrari… smh

That being said, I’m optimistic for this franchise going forward. The massively positive response this game has seen (despite its, to me at least, obvious shortcomings) should tip off the game makers that the community is hungry for the types of gameplay that Arceus displayed. I’d maybe pay $30 for this game, but $60? No way.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

PatrizioItaly,07-02-2022,"I've completed the 100% of the game last night. I'll always recommend this game to the franchise's fans but not without many criticisms.
This game changes the game play completely with many long awaited new mechanics that we can only hope will stay in the future games. It's still a major improvement from the past games especially the recent BDSP remakes.
Unfortunately the technical aspects of this title are lacking and may lower the enjoyment of this experience by a lot.
It's sad to know that your avatar is exploring a forest just because of its name appearing on the top corner and not by the visual environment. It's unsatisfying having many places very similar to one another inside the same map. The art direction is great as always but the immersion is ruined by its lacking.
We knew of this lacking by the trailer but I would have still granted an 8 out of this game if not for another very disturbing aspect. The writing in this game is a new low. Pokémon had always had childish writing but in this instance every other dialog contradicts the one before. We are in a time where pokémon are feared but 50% of the village population is from a well established region where they already have pokéride, HM and are living peacefully with the pokémon. We are told that no one knows how to capture pokémon then they explain to us how to do so. They told us we are the greater battler but we have a teacher for that way more skilled than us. We are told that all the pokémon are fearsome then we are shown other character knowing that there are many species that are very peaceful toward them and easy to catch or to live with.
I know this game is mostly for children but I would love to have a game not contradicting itself so often.
The combat mechanics are an improvement but they need some fixing especially while battling other trainers. If you build, like me, a slow team it might occur that when one member is KO the next one entering will have to wait 2/3 moves from the opponent resulting in another KO without being able to do anything. In late game I had to rethink my team because one trainer attacked 13 times in a row demolishing my team. This is not a rise in the difficulty but some design flaw since I might want to play with my favorite pokémon without having such a disadvantage and all slower pokémon fill penalized.
Over all the game is a good one and the game play loop in enjoyable. If they keep working on their optimizations skills and fix up the few problem this game could be a new starting point for the brand,",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

IshrakRahman,08-02-2022,"Pokemon Legends Arceus was something to get hyped of right from the start when they teased it. The Massive Openworld makes this game really interesting to discover More and MORE!!! With the ability to control the camera angle was great from Sword and Shield's wild area but in this game, we are free to use this feature everywhere. As well as the battles and while talking to NPCs in some case. I really enjoy playing this game and spending hours and hours in it catching'em all. Really appriciate their effort in this game. I am now looking forward to GameFreak's next project.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
baelrog,01-04-2022,"This game is absolute trash. Nintendo proves once again how much they try to provide bare minimum experience and then over charge because of the brand name. This game is visceral garbage on every level. The fights are boring, the story is lame, but worst off is the utter and complete waste of time. I swear the game changes spawn rates of certain Pokémon to waste your time. Over 3 hours looking for one that’s supposed to be in a specific area and nothing. Do not buy this game, it’s trash. If anyone wants a free copy just pay for shipping, I’m never playing this POS game again.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
SamirMrtnz,06-02-2022,"Un juego decepcionante, apartado gráfico de risa, jugabilidad la misma por turnos pero al menos ahora es un ""mundo abierto"", tiene excesivos diálogos que las primeras horas de juego te la pasas más hablando que explorando ese mundo abierto, y aunque la historia nunca a sido el fuerte de pokemón es increíble que hagan algo tan malo; creo que todos tenemos en mente el pokemón perfecto, y este juego quiso hacer eso, pero el resultado a quedado horroroso, por favor Gamefreak ponle ganas",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
GreenMenace,03-02-2022,"Did Pokemon give us a story where the point wasn’t to become the best battler? Did Pokemon aim to make a game that pleases all ages? Did Pokemon revamp the battle system to take a different spin? And did they incorporate “boss” fights?

The answer to all of these questions is a resounding yes. I wasn’t in love with the game at the start because my expectations were low and the story is straightforward and simple, but while this game won’t earn any awards, it’ll be a hidden gem that I can confidently recommend to any player who has ever had any interest in Pokemon. The game blends Pokemon Snap with a standard Pokemon game, adding strategic elements to catching Pokemon.

Pros
Opportunities for strategy
Wide arsenal of things to do
Smooth gameplay

Cons
The graphics aren’t just below average, it can get in the way
Late game gets redundant

When I was playing BOTW, I couldn’t help but wish it were a Pokemon game. I had little interest in sneaking up on monsters to kill them, but the thought of using the environment to catch Pokemon was thrilling. I had no clue that a game like Legends Arceus would come to fruition, or that it’d actually be a lot of fun. There’s always something to do—earn money, complete sidequests, work on the dex, catch new Pokemon, strengthen your Pokemon, collect rare items, and shiny hunt. It cannot be stressed enough that you can switch activities at a whim. That level 39 cherrim my trainer fought for literally 24 in-game hours as I threw every kind of ball in the game at it? I got so annoyed I ran, caught 4 other Pokemon is succession, and switched areas to earn some money. It takes a bit for you to unlock every area, but you can always return to areas you’ve unlocked.

Strategy-wise, I had the most fun playing this game than any other in a long time when I went to encounter a flock of Ursaring. Each one was ten levels higher than my strongest Pokemon, so I had to try to lure them out one at a time. Problem was, luring them out too far lead to interruptions from other Pokemon like Luxio/Luxray. When I finally managed to isolate one, they could still wipe my team easily so I had to develop a strategy to consistently defeat them. It was an absolute blast, and an unexpected challenge.

Fifty hours in, and the strategy remains. However, it does get to the point where you’re just chucking balls at everything you see to fill the dex. It minimizes the strategy of the game and eliminates challenge, and that impacts the fun. I love the font, but the graphics really need attention. It’s not just rough around the edges, there’s missed potential. And there should be more ways to interact with the Pokemon you’ve caught. Literally, work on the graphics in every department and you’ve got something really special.
What makes this entry so exciting is the idea that Pokemon might consider evolving from its roots to something bigger, and in many people’s opinions, including my own, something better. Definitely a game worth reviewing.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
alexoboe,03-02-2022,"Es el mejor juego de Pokémon de la última década. El cambio de formato se siente como un aire fresco y renovador para la saga. El habitual jpg basado en gimnasios y liga llegó a su culmen en Pokémon blanco y negro y sus secuelas, y las entregas posteriores solo fueron a peor, culminando en el desastre de Pokémon espada y escudo, y en los ""remaster"" (porque no remake) de sinnoh. Para el futuro, arreglar el apartado gráfico, porque le resta mucho y le posiciona a los ojos del público (comprensiblemente) en una posición muy inferior a la que mereciera con respecto a los títulos lanzados en 2022. Incluso con ese apartado gráfico, Leyendas Pokémon Arceus es fácilmente uno de los mejores Pokémon de la historia, y el mejor Pokémon en Nintendo Switch, eclipsando y dejando en evidencia a las últimas tres generaciones de Pokémon y todos los spin off que las han acompañado. Un digno GOTY y 10 si tuviera un apartado gráfico a la altura de esta saga.

FrannyB,02-02-2022,"Ante el aluvión de críticas con notas bajísimas y de notas con un 10 para compensar o yo que se, voy a intentar hacer un análisis sincero después de habermelo pasado y de tener la pokedex a puntito de completar:

-Gráficos: de broma, los fps de los pokemon en la distancia se pueden contar con 3 dedos, el renderizado del entorno es ridículo con un popping que hacía tiempo que no veía. Incluso en ciertas cinemáticas que no están mal, se ven las texturas del entorno y la vuelven cutre. Si hay que poner nota, un 1, porque salen pokemons y la nostalgia me obliga darle algo.

-Apartado técnico: Meh, saltos que te lanzan volando, algún que otro teleport cuando desciendes laderas, pero en general pocos bugs y los que pasan no han ensuciado la experiencia de juego, aunque se nota que no está pulido.

-Sonido: la nota objetiva seria un 5, cumple la banda sonora, sin ser especialmente épica en ningun momento, si que incluyen rolias clasicas en la franquicia que gustan. Los dialogos son a base de cuadros de ttextto, sin ningún ssonido de soportte, ni cuando hablan los pokemons, que no se que les costaría poner el audio del ""PIKAA ""cuando abre la boca el pikachu y no tener que leerlo, es ridículo. Ahora, puedes tocar el principio del himno de Andalucía con la flauta, 10/10 en sonido.

-Ambientación: Not bad cuando te haces a los gáficos, si que consigue cierta inmersión y a ratos parece que realmente estás teniendo la experiencia que han publicitado y que los fans pedíamos, no sabría si ponerle entre el 6-7. Aunque si antes eran los entrenadores los que estaban esperando meses en el mismo sitio a que tu pasaras a enfrentarte a ellos, ahora son los pokemons, con spawns fijos, sin movilidad e interacción entre ellos, si eso alguno que duerme y poco más.

-Jugabilidad: Es muy divertido, las nuevas mecánicas encajan bien y me tienen enganchado aún, creo que es la primera vez que voy a completar la pokedex ya que no me aburro capturando, por lo que para mi es el más divertido hasta la fecha, le pondría un 9.

-Contenido: No se si hay más postgame del que estoy haciendo, pero si lo que buscas son combates y estrategia, por ahora no es el juego, hay 7 u 8 combates contados en la historia y con la dificultad perfecta para que mi perro los juegue por mi. El número de la pokedex me parece correcto, ya que no abruma, pero se nota mucho el tijeretazo al contenido base para vender el DLC en unos meses, el cual si incluye el pvp y algún modo de combates pve que asciendan en dificultad, muy a mi pesar lo compraré ya que convertiría este pokemon en el mejor que se ha hecho, con todos sus fallos, pero que ahoramismo es sólo historia.

-Historía: está bien, no es una peli de Tarantino pero consigue que le prestes atención a ratos, aunque los incesantes cuadros de texto rompen el ritmo de juego y desesperan a cualquiera,el tutorial son 3-4 horas de sufrimiento pero después se abre el juego y es muy disfrutable.

RESUMEN: Si buscas una experiencia parecida a la serie de la infancia, con pokemons por ahí sueltos y un mundo por explorar, es tu juego, si buscas un rpg por turnos como hasta ahora era la franquicia, no te lo recomiendo, ahoramismo es un pokemon snap con algunos combates, pero con la potencialidad de convertirse en el mejor hasta la fecha por los cambios en los ivs, el sistema de ataque y turnos, el cambio a las MT y a la ""memoria"" y personalidades de los pokemons, que vuelven el competitivo mucho mas accesible (si es que lo instauran). Por lo que para mi sería un 5-6 comparandolo con la competencia, un 7 si miramos de donde viene la franquicia y el cambio que propone, un ""must have"" para los fans como yo (y me duele), y si con nuevo contenido hay más combates y un competitivo decente, que motive al jugador a algo más que a completar la pokedex, creo que será el mejor juego de la IP hasta la fecha.

Perdón por el tocho, espero que le sea útil a alguien, me voy a capturar Eevees para evolucionarlos.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

nezeeqko,07-02-2022,"Gameplay is more repetitive than previous games, NPC don't even have voice acting making cutscenes and conversations boring (NPC grunts etc), wild Pokemons are just walking mindlessly with no simple routines making the game feels more lifeless (for example in Monster Hunter Stories 1 and 2 you can see monsters sleeping, eating and in Stories 1 some monsters like Velocipreys are going out hunting preys, and it was a 3DS game).

Graphics are horrendous. In a game where 90% of the time you were walking out in the world, at least make the world looks decent (it was worse than a 3DS game). Character models are a total downgrade from Sword and Shield, like HOW? Imagine visual artists working in another game trying to make their game looks as pleasing as possible only for Pokemon re-tarts to say they work doesn't matter because ""GrApIcHs ArEn'T eVeRyThInG"". I don't say that Pokemon need 4K ultra-realistic visuals, all im saying is at least make it looking better than fecking Wii games.

My biggest offender in this game is the animations. Monster Hunter Stories 2 and SMT V are proof that a monster collecting game can have good animations. Unsurprisingly, Pokemon continue it trends to make sub-par animations that feel robotic and unnatural. Just try compare MHST 2 animations to PLA.

TLDR: In my offensive opinion, **** game made by **** developers played by nostalgia blinded fans who never play any other game than Pokemon.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
PHE_AT_SL,07-02-2022,"Legends Arceus is just incredibly ugly. In addition, so much is not ideally thought through and is boring and repetitive.

Zquaranteneuf,03-02-2022,"Pokemon delivers once again a sub-par product that feels as clunky as it is uninspired. It hides itself under the veil of being open world, but in reality it's nothing more than a series of blocked entries and constant hand-holding set in a large map. Hell, it's not even possible to get out of the main village; you hit an invisible wall. You have to warp, with the map, to another point to change areas. Open world my @$$.

The player is once again treated as someone who can't grasp the simplest gameplay concepts, yet the menuing is extremely convoluted. You get interrupted constantly by instructions, directions, and obligatory tasks to perform. This is not a game; it's a tour set on rails.

I'll end this by saying it also has the worst graphics we've seen in the last 5-6 years. It's not even worth the previous generation of Nintendo console. It would barely be acceptable for a Gamecube title.

Pokemon must be laughing hard to have so many blind dedicated fans that will buy every kind of minimal effort they're willing to shove down their throat at full price.

Jinouga,04-02-2022,"The absolute minimum. A review.

With Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Gamefreak has created a game, that is on the one hand loved and praised to heavens and on the other hand, objektively critisesed to bare bones. But how is this even possible? Wouldn't a really good game be critisesed only by haters without any foundational and objektive reasoning?

Pokemon Legends: Arceus tries to be and is very different from your classic Pokemon game. The changes in gameplay are refreshing and it's clear, that Gamefreak finally pushes Pokemon to new grounds. The gameplay is very different and very pleasing. You can through a Pokeball to a Pokemon and catch it WHILE you are already on your way to a tree with fruits on it. And you trough a ball to the tree and your Pokemon collects the fruits. Then you have different maps where you go to do quests, like in the Monster Hunter games. This concept on it's own is very nice and can be quite adicting.
The story is also quite interesting. You get to know the beginning of the Sinnoh area, where only settlers exist and cities are yet to build.
However, this where the negatives come in...

1. Grafics/Artstyle/Tech: High and grafics are by all means no necessity. But what Gamefreak delivered here, is a disgrace. A punch into the gamers face and eyes. The world is empty, there literally are 3-4 types of different tree designes that where just copy pasted like in a map editor. The textures are muddy, low res, edgy, polygonal. Some designes unironically look like they copied them from an N64 game (trees). Look at the god damn lava! Like they didn't allow the designers, to give it texture and make it look like actual lava and not pumpkin soup.
60 FPS are also no requirement for a game. But somewhat stable 30 FPS like in breath of the wild, Xenoblade Chronicles games or Monster Hunter Rise should be the expectable. ESPECIALLY from a BILLION Dollar company, that owns the biggest and most successfull franchise of all time. The framerate constantly is below 30 and in some areas the lags are maddening... Breath of the wild on the WiiU was smooth as **** in comparison. It baffles my mind how reviews credit the game to be ""technically faultless"".

2. Pokemon and Charcters: From a game, that want's you to explore a world full of animals (Pokemon), that want's you to study them and build the pokedex, you could expect, that they interact with each other or have some kind of behaviour. But no. Nothing. The Pokemon just stand there and go from point A to point B, without a reason. The don't yawn, scratch their ears, scream at ech other, play around, eat grass/fruits/insects, smell etc. There is no Evoli cuddling with another, or Starly building a nest. They are lifeless creatures. They could very well scarecrows that are mechanically moved between point A and B.
The Characters in this game have like no gestures. The head looks like a robot when the look from one person to another, eyes don't seem to moved at all apart from the eyelids. And in centuries of RPG developement, earning billions and billions of USD, Pokemon has still no voice acting (s if they wouldn't have an Anime where they could borrow actors from. FOR THEIR OWN FRANCHSIE).
Also... why the hell can't we fly UPWARDS?

3. Quests and Progression: The quests... repetitive, boring and uninspired. It's like Gamefreak thought of a way to artificially increase the length of the game. They send you from point A to point B to talk to someone, just to be sent back to point A. And this feels like, they want you to spend time with walking around between speechbubbles, because they just haven't thought of enough content.

All in all, the game is obviously rushed and needed at least a year if not two, to really be worth a full prized AAA game, from probably the most wealthy gaming company in the world. Every other independent devstudio could have done game that looks appealing to the eye, implement animations to pokemon and characters, think of actual quests and a better way to fill the pokedex (kill or catch 25 of this pokemon to get the pokedexentry). This game, didn't even try to be good to make money, because the pokemon company knew from the very beginning, that it will print them millions and millions of lovely, fresh and green USD. They didn't even try to hide tha fact, that they didn't spend much money on the development, with good visuals, like EA does.

Pokemon Legends: Arceus is the result of a company who only want's our money, because they already have built up their reputation with the first 6 generations of Pokemon games, the anime and merchandise. They know that they only have to do one thing, to be able to make more money with Pokemon TM : The absolute minimum (and even less than that).",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

AudioRemedy,06-02-2022,"PROS:
- decent story
- fun gameplay restructure
- pokedex log tasks that are intuitive and entertaining
- crafting mechanics that tie into open-world gathering
- you get to ride a menagerie of impressive pokemon and the platforming is decent
- new evolutions for old favorites
- slick battle animations
- item management/""survival"" aspects with punishing consequences
- ""stealth"" mechanics that add another layer of skill to catching and/or battling wild Pokemon

CONS:
- short of establishing a new camp or farming plot, all side quest rewards are virtually useless and a few of them will require an unpleasant amount of your time to accomplish (sloppy/lazy gameplay padding)
- the game has very little content compared to other entries in the series (~40 hours)
- postgame has little purpose, it's just a dex-grind
- no multiplayer/PvP
- there is only a handful of trainer battles, 98% of battles will be wild pokemon encounters
- ""boss fights"" are essentially janky, unmemorable minigames
- mediocre graphics that have no excuse for running the system so hot while looking so bad

I love this game, but it's kinda tough to avoid getting wrecked by high level Alpha pokemon if you wander too far. oh, and i would say at least make save datas for a Pokemon Let's Go game, Sword or Shield, and Brilliant Diamond or Shining Pearl for some free clothing items and two bonus quests involving mythical pokemon in the postgame. oh, and it's also fantastic that my favorite starter pokemon, Cyndaquil, is a starter in this game, but i digress. just pick up the game for yourself and find out how good it is for yourself!",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

However the graphics are in fact pretty awful, while usually that doesn't mean anything to me personally, somehow this game makes me notice more and the pop in is pretty anoying, I don't really understand how games like breath of the wild can be a launch title and look way more amazing due to clever art style tricks to make it run flawlessly on the Switch's limited hardware but I assume that after this game's success there will be more effort put into these aspects of the next Arceus like game. unfortunately the graphics do hold it back a bit but I'd rather have annoying graphic problems and a huge rework of Pokémon than another bland mainline copy-paste Pokémon game.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Phynster,09-02-2022,"Overall for a Pokémon Game the changes they made were exactly what we have been waiting for for years. The issues start once you realize though this is not a Open World Game and technically even less Open World than previous games.

They straight up stole the World System from Monster Hunter where you have a Central Hub filled with NPCs you can converse with, merchants, and crafting capabilities; of which they didn't really even use recipes they already have(for example only brown apricots are in the game preventing the acquisition of pokeballs such as the Love ball or Premier Ball). and then Exploration Zones, which are just Wild Area's from Sword and Shield, but Larger. The Alpha Pokémon are just permanent weaker versions of Dynamaxing, which is nice but not really anything new, they are supposed to come with special moves but those same moves can just be bought from the move trainer for money.
Money, never thought a Pokémon game would make money redundant, but I wasted my first 2 Million just buying moves for Pokémon I ended up releasing back into the Wild eventually. Some recipes cost money, and can be costly(upwards of 50,000 so far), but I made 2 Million before I even quelled the first Noble. You don't need to buy pokeballs or potions or their upgraded versions, cause you can just craft them. Bag Space is kind of expensive after awhile but after the first 15 upgrades I've never had an issue with running out of space before needing to go rest and recover pp.

The game isn't even anywhere close to Open World. The Central Hub is separated by a loading screen between every region, regions of which you can not travel between without going back to the Central Hub, and walking into buildings causes loading screens. That is a Closed World. They have Wild Pokémon spotting's where a group of something specific will spawn in larger numbers, but that only happens to 1 region at a time, and only when you go back to the Central Hub. They also have these things called Time Distortions which summon Evolution Items, stronger Pokémon perfect for level grinding, and coloured plates and star dust which can be crafted together into star pieces. But only 3 or 4 will spawn in a region at a time, afterwards you're forced to go back to the Central Hub again if you want more of these to spawn. Before going back to town, your also forced to turn in all of your currently finished research, which gives you money and xp towards your Star Rank.

The Star Ranks. What was the purpose of these, I was 7 Star and all Pokémon of all levels would obey my command before I even quelled Kleavor, that's the equivalent of 2 Gym Badges in previous games. Which means by time I actually got into the Mirelands, every one of my Pokémon, which I collect 1 of each one in their Alpha Form and Shiny Forms, were all 1 hitting everything, including the Noble of the Mirelands, the Miss Fortune Sisters, and all the ""Trainers""

Trainers, where are all my trainers at? I've rushed to unlock Braviary and now stopping to actually perfect the Dex, but like where are the trainers at? you fight a handful of Leaders and Wardens of the Diamond and Pearl Clan, and even give out Balls and Pokémon to people to start them out, but the only real trainer encounter is the Miss Fortune Sisters who Ambush you from time to time.

WHERE IS MY FOLLOWER POKEMON!!! Like seriously, Yellow, HeartGold, SoulSilver, Lets Go, These were some of your best games because of the follower Pokémon, stop removing that feature!

Combat Evolved? I noticed and love the fact that you went out of your way and removed redundant moves such as Harden, and condensed them into their other more significant abilities like Iron Defense, but where's the Pokémon Combat? This would have been a perfect game to allow us to control our Pokémon during battle and do combat like an RPG instead of turn based. Dodge, Block, Attack, all of that could have easily been done instead of being able to run around during combat as the trainer, kind of redundant there and a little useless for a feature.

Although yes I did say this was the game we've been waiting for for years, I have to lower my rating because of the fact they keep removing features of their series that actually did very well and attracted people to their game. All-in-all I have spent over 100 hours on the game already and have perfect 115 / 242 available currently. Hopefully with future updates and dlc they can fix some issues and maybe try and actually make an open world game, not just claim it to be one and steal the concept from someone else.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

eddy12,03-02-2022,"This game is a preview what future pokemon games should look like.
The Gameplay is great and with the pokedex quest quite entertaining.
But it is lacking in some basics, for example: no breeding, no abilitys, no special evolution(Mega, ZStones or Dinamax). Though I liked some graphic elements (grassstalks, attacks), the overall graphics are garbage. The diffuculty was unexpected high, I was continuously underleveld and had trouble to travel areas without resting. The trainer battles were to easy (not level dependent), but with abilitys, items this could improve the difficulty. I really hope they continue evolving the series in this direction and maybe even doing this in a bigger scope and with better graphics.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
bcrawford2045,03-02-2022,"I absolutely love this game. It’s a fantastic evolution of the series we have been looking for. It encapsulates most things that makes Pokémon special. I call these things the elements of discovery, growth and adventure! Seeing Pokémon fully realised in space makes the experience more seamless, while the flow made by the quality of life changes makes everything so instantaneous! It’s absolutely fantastic to see game freak challenge the player and make Pokémon genuinely threatening to both your Pokémon and the player! The gameplay loop flows so well it keeps myself continuing engaged, a testament to its accessibility and gameplay design! This game has its flaws, but it’s easy to overlook when I am more excited about Pokémon than I have been in years to see the possibilities of where the series could go! I would love to see trainer battles and more civilisation realised in future entries. Particularly with battles it would give further reason to strategise in developing your team.

Irarius,05-02-2022,"this is a solid 7/10 game
heres my reasons, bulletpoints and then a short explanation
first positive
- a step forward for the franchise
- overworld maps are bigger then expected
- 2 /3 pokeball choises are amazing
- a bunch of the bossfights are great,
- only a few trainer battles, and most of them are decent, you never feel burned out by them.
- you barely get annoyed by the rival
- alot of good character designs
- customization is decent
- riding feels great and is fluid
- going through maps is good
- oppertunities to catch rare mons are there, and they are good
- you can catch EVERY mon of the game, including special evolutions,
- trade evolutions have an item now, and thats amazing
- a few rly good siequests, some of which can permanently alter things and thats amazing
- sometimes the game looks good
- new fighting system is interesting
- SOME sideobjectives that are kinda neat
- legendary battles are nice

negatives
- the game is kinda flat in content
- maps feel empty with nothing to do in them
- overworld is filled with overly agressiv pokemon who will get aggrod from insanely far away for
way too long,
- maps can feel like hotrooms where everybody wants to kill you, and that rly fast
- some sidequests are downright ****
- the wisp thing is interesting, but kinda dumb too, a radar would have been good for this
- no minimap, and that would have been needed alot
- riding camera is unacceptable, its horribly bad
- wild pokemon are insanely unbalanced, my lvl 80 maxed out mon can get murdered in 2 turns
by a lvl 30 mon... that just cant be a thing
- wild mons can alot of times attack you twice before you can even do a single thing,
- pokeballs can bounce off the air, sometimes its simply not possible to gaige if a ball can hit
- sometimes you cant catch a mon because the catch range is not enough, and thats rly
inconsistent somehow
- the story is kinda... wack and i dont rl know wth is going on. in the grand scheme of things what
is even happening
- the game is OFTEN ugly, flat and just bad / boring design wise
this encompasses
style: its a poor mans breath of the wild
presentation: its a poor mans breath of the wild
visuals: washy, colours look flat
stability : this game is not rly lagging, but anything further away then you can throw a
pokeball will look like it is lagging out, or loading in half
- pokemon just stand around, only a hand full of them are actually doing something, ponyta for
example will try to play with you, but rly most of them want you dead, and there isnt rly
anything between most of the time, we desperatly needed some defensiv mons that would
balance it out by helping you or fear away mons - progression is kinda meh, there was definietly a better option here for example pokemon half of the lvl of the mons that will obey you, should not attack you anymore so if you command mons up to lvl 50, mons of 25 or under arent agressiv towards you or give clothes properties like better stealth, or something like that its rly lazy yeah in total ALOT of missed chances, BUT still it was a totaly playable game, and while alot of times being good, the game managed to piss me off BAD when my cam while riding NON STOP got stuck when pokemon would permanently break my stealth out of nowhere when my pokeballs didnt work because i was 1 cm to far away which sucks ALOT of times when a wild mon 30 lvls under m,y own mon ONESHOTS my mon... and THEN i get options for battle... even if i engage them, like wtf bro 5/10 is mediocre = sword and shield 4/10 is less the mediocre = BDSM remakes 6/10 would be an improvement over the last game without anything big 7/10 is when a game improves, but its not fully realized also washy and inprecise controls to earn anything aobe this 8/10 the ideas are realized and also a bit deeper, **** works fine 9/10 the game is outright amazing, and for the time it has been released is up to date which this game 100% IS NOT it looks like crap, runs almost as bad, and features seem rushed 10/10 the game actually pushes forward what it means to be a game of that genre + it works fine and is at its time beyond what others deliver this is not the case, here, the game 100% underdelivers and prol needed another 1-2 years of pure development to be this good so whats could have been done in 1-2 years of more development? cleaning up the game, adding more things to do in the overworlds coop for the maps like they did in bdsm underground or S&S wild area increase stability polish visuals adding a few more behaviors for the very limited pokedex all of this could be possible EASY and would make the game a 10/10 other games manage to accomplish this and pokemon is a billion dollar franchise no excuse in the world can excuse this not being the case this thing sells millions of copies",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

SurTails101,09-02-2022,"Didn't expect much from just looking at the previews of the game. I thought I would wait for critics to come out. I didn't expect to succeed and yet it did (by switch standards).

Got the game one day after release and been addicted since then. The core gameplay is very fun. It's very effective. My only complaints are that it's a bit strange that you always have to head back to jubilife village before heading to another zone. Also, I would love the combat to be perhaps just a bit more interactive, not that I dislike the classical turn base stuff, but maybe something Paper-Mario-esque, hell even better: like the tales series, though that could be asking for a bit much

On the graphical side, I think people are a bit harsh. Though, I compare this to Shin Megami Tensei V. The games run at similar performance (30 fps with the occasionnal stuter). I do believe SMTV looks better though. Not a huge complaint here, knowing the limitations of the switch. Game is still charming and doesn't look too bad.

Music is great. Enjoying the themes.

Game progression seems much more fast paced. I have never been a huge fan of the whole exp share thing, but I think they got it right this time as the game just seems more difficult that other pokemon games (alpha pokemons, 1 vs 2-3 aggro encounters)

Writing this review with over 50 hours in.

Arod4,02-02-2022,It’s a fun game but the entire battling aspect of the games is essentially put on the back burner and forgotten. Not nearly enough opportunity to use the team you assemble. Love the new mechanics and open world aspect but the graphics are rather poor,7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Bellzos,03-02-2022,"While this is the shakeup that the Pokemon Franchise desperately needed, ultimately it is flawed in its execution. The game play is great, the story not so much.

Strong and Agile style feel like they need more time in the oven. Performance is unacceptable for a game that looks this poor. The game feels as if it needed more time to reach excellence. I am happy that everyone is enjoying their time on the game though, however I feel it is disingenuous to give this game a 10/10 with glaring issues such as these.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
DeedyLump,06-02-2022,"The standards for Pokemon games is at an all time low. While Legends Arceus is by no means bad, it continues the trend of a barebones game that feels immediately outdated in a franchise that just doesn't seem to grow. It's a backwards step, maybe a reduction of the formula to set a new foundation for later games, but it's just a bit too late for me. The world isn't an enjoyment to traverse. It's hindered by being visually underwhelming, but it just lacks a sense of activity. The pokemon exist only for the player. They don't interact with the world in any meaningful way, they're just collectibles. In the past, this wasn't as big of a problem because creating a team to conquer the league was always your goal; here, the pokemon are the only real goal. Yet, they just linger as mostly aggressive or timid creatures not really displaying much if their nature or showing character. Maybe you're now thinking I expect too much, and yes, I do. I expect a lot from one of the most successful franchises of my lifetime. Considering other titles in the franchise have had features that would be suitable here, but as is the trend with Pokemon games; we lose 3 features and gain 1. And yet, here we are, with one of the most well received games in the franchise in a while. If only, it seems, because the game is just about good enough. Is it a step in the right direction? Absolutely. Is it a good pokemon game? Sure. In a vacuum of just pokemon games it may be one of the best. But I'm of the opinion it should be better. Call it entitled, but having supported the franchise since the first iteration, I do think the fanbase deserves a game of much higher quality. Which now leaves us in the position we're all in; we want to support the good parts of the franchise in hopes we get better versions of that. But the excitement and initial highly positive reaction from just getting something that isn't a disappointment means the quality of this game (which is quite low) is more than enough for a company that just wants to make more money. It's an okay game. It's not bad, but it's not great. And when the honeymoon period wears off, we'll be back to a state of disappointment as we wait for something truly good.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Jayt491,08-02-2022,"I’ve played every single Pokémon game for the last 25 years. Pokémon is my favorite franchise of all time, so I’m not one of these trolls on the internet who like to shout extra loud about how bad a Pokémon game is when they aren’t actually fans of the series. You won’t see me waking up extra early and logging online to scream bad opinions to the void about video games that don’t interest me. I’m not out here critiquing first person shooters cause I have no place doing so.. because I don’t enjoy them. Plain and simple. The people online with the extra harsh criticism of this game are exactly that. Trust me, if you are a real Pokémon fan this game is everything. I’ve never had more fun playing a Pokémon game, ever. (Well I won’t count Gold and Silver, that’s pure nostalgia)

This game has me so excited for the future of the series. It’s a glimpse into soooo much potential and it’s just such a pure good time. The franchise is notorious for taking very small steps forward at a time. This was a GIANT leap. Game freak have never takin this much of a jump forward and it’s exciting. The story is actually interesting and I find myself really taking my time as to not rush through it. which to be frank, I haven’t found myself super enthralled by a Pokémon games story in a very long time. It’s a breath of fresh air and a fun new way to play. The game isn’t focused on the same aspect we are used to. So you have to remember that the focus is exploring and research, not gym badges and elite 4.. and it’s very good at what it’s intended for. I’m 60 hours in and still only half way through the main story. I have been letting myself get lost and immersed in the world. There is so much to complete that I know it’ll easily take a almost 200 hours to do everything. Going to each new area is always exciting and discovering Pokémon in their habitats never gets old. You’ll find yourself excited to see a Pokémon you’ve seen a million times in other games. They put a lot of time into each Pokémon having their own personalities and animations. They feel more alive than ever. It’s challenging as well. If you’re not prepared before venturing out you can find yourself getting attacked by a gang of Pokémon and blacking out real fast. We’ve never been able to experience such a realistic feel to Pokémon in the wild. It’s amazing. I could go on and on and on. Honestly just buy it.

And get excited for what’s hopefully just a glimpse into what’s to come for the Pokémon series!!",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Rhern26,26-02-2022,"Loving this game. I’m about 8 and a half hours in. Not going to give any spoilers but the game does get funner and you’re able to travel more and faster as you play. I was really considering trading/selling this game after my first two hours. The reason for an 8 and not a perfect score is simply due to the unnecessary dialogue in the game which gets very annoying as you’re just trying to go out there to explore and catch/level up your Pokémon. I understand it’s part of the story, but they could have limited all the text saving me from mashing the a/b button and skimming through it. I’m not trying to sit there for an hour reading through what the NPC has to say for a certain quest. It would have been better if there was some sort of voice acting which would actually bring interest in the story. Aside from this, game is really fun and rewarding just like older Pokémon games. Love the battling as it adds a bit more strategy now with agile/strong moves. Catching Pokémon is also quite fun and provides some sort of achievement in catching the same Pokémon more than once.

Onioncreature,18-02-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus had a great deal of potential leading up to release, but the end product is sadly lacking.

It's nice to see a major attempt to revitalize the age-old formula that's remained largely unchanged since the Gameboy, but the execution is muddled. Catching Pokemon in real-time feels great, alongside the overhauled battle system, but the content of Arceus is simply too repetitive to be enjoyed in the long term. The open world environments are only really fun to explore the first time around. The variety is really lacking, and the Pokedex system requiring multiple captures and interactions with the same creature makes the experience a bit of a slog.

The style of the game is initially appealing, a game set in the distant past of the Sinnoh region is conceptually very compelling. Unfortunately, Arceus fails to live up to it's premise and it's world and environments tend to be totally without life and character. There's only a single proper town, and there's very little in the way of meaningful interaction here. The graphics are noticeably subpar for an official Nintendo release, with plenty of minor visual bugs to distract you from the experience.

The story is another letdown, as throughout the game's considerable length nothing of note really happens. It's a very basic set of events, but the game can't help itself from including walls upon walls of text. The characters are really not at all memorable, and only serve basic story functions before being left to the wayside. This is a shame, as many of the characters are really well designed, and several represent the ancestors of characters from Diamond and Pearl, which is a pretty interesting concept; so it's a shame that they feel like such a throwaway element of the experience. Although I was initially quite excited to learn about the world Legends: Arceus takes place in, this enthusiasm quickly fizzled over the game's playtime and the story petered out in a disappointingly obvious and expected way.

I wish that I could separate the disappointing parts of Arceus from it's promising new gameplay formula, but that's simply not possible. The new gameplay style could be a great new direction for the series, but it's simply too repetitive in this current iteration to be compelling past the first few times you experience it. It's also a major letdown to see how utterly lifeless the world, characters, and story are, as these elements had the potential to be legitimately compelling and explore the world of Sinnoh in exciting new ways. Legends: Arceus is probably worth checking out if you're a fan of the series and want to see a new take on the gameplay formula, but don't expect much more than that.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

manufail,22-02-2022,"Pkmn Legends Arceus (PLA) is a step in the right direction but still shows how Gamefreak (GF) makes minuscule progress in game design. Let me start out with the good. I haven't had FUN playing a Pkmn game in so many years, and finally, a game delivers on the fun. I haven't felt a pkmn game had hope to be considered a good game until now. That being said, I am baffled at why GF made this game worse than it needed to be. Fans have been complaining at how long tutorials are and this game's tutorial is a PAIN to play. And yet, for all the new features in the game, the tutorial teaches you none of them really (its essentially just capture a pkmn tutorial). To me that's sort of the story of this game. Fun to play but the game refuses to let you enjoy it. There are SO MANY cutscenes in this game that take you out of the experience. Why you still can't skip them is beyond me. Why I still have to wait for each text scroll before I can continue to the next one makes no sense to me. Honestly, if this game had a skippable tutorial and skippable cutscenes or just none at all - it would be a much more pleasant experience. The sad part about that complaint is that GF has no excuse. Yes the graphics are awful but there's a million excuses I can give for that (no engine, Switch can't handle it, time constraints vs risk of project success, etc.). But the tutorials and cutscene pacing was a conscious choice by GF that could've been avoided. I'm glad this game exists and I'm hoping GF can merge all these changes into a new mainline series of games. As of right now, PLA is a step in the right direction for GF, but unfortunately a super safe dive at change and a continued display of antiquated game design. I would love for GF to continue along this path and not give up but this game is not quite there. Giant leap for a pkmn game but I am tired of giving Pkmn a pass just bc I love the franchise so much.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Yupiter,20-02-2022,"Un jeu Pokemon qui apporte des nouvelles mécaniques et une façon de jouer comme on en attendait depuis longtemps. C'est un bonheur de pouvoir se balader dans des zones ouvertes avec la possibilité de rencontrer et chasser les Pokemon à vue. Dommage que la technique de base soit raté... J'espère que Game Freak conservera les points positifs de ce jeu pour ses futurs jeux.

Mes points positifs:
- Un jeu Pokemon en temps réel, tu croises un Pokemon tu peux l'attraper directement ou l'affronter
- L'univers dans lequel on est plongé, l'humain craint les Pokemon par sa méconnaissance de celui-ci, ce qui rend le jeu plus ""sérieux""
- Une difficulté plus relevée qui accentue le côté Pokemon sauvage et dangereux que le jeu veut véhiculer.
- De bonnes idées pour améliorer l'ergonomie de jeu, menu agréables, gestion des capacités plus simples, évolution maitrisées, les déplacements en montures , les points d'efforts au lieu des IVs EVs
- Des zones ouvertes dans lesquelles il est agréable de se balader et y croiser des Pokemon ou autres
- On peut capturer réellement TOUS les Pokemon disponible sur un seul jeu.
- Le système de craft
- Les combats de boss accessibles à tous via les option recommencer depuis le début ou à partir de la jauge actuelle

Mes points négatifs:
- La réalisation technique au niveau des graphismes, clipping et le ressenti général est mauvais. J'aime Pokemon mais à certains moment on sort juste de l'immersion du jeu ou on arrive pas à y retourner. Des étudiants en école d'animation 3D peuvent aisément trouver les nombreux défauts sur le jeu.
- Les quêtes secondaires inintéressantes, aucun intérêt de les faire sauf celles qui améliorer la boutique ou champs de récolte
- La quête de récolte des 107 flammes de Spiritomb qui prolonge artificiellement la durée de jeu... Quand l'histoire principale est finie ou au bout d'un certain temps vous devriez juste indiquer la localisation de celles-ci. Le jeu est déjà assez moche pour ne pas avoir envie de s'y balader trop longuement et en plus la distance d'affichage fait que les flammes peuvent mettre du temps à apparaître même à 3 mètres...
- Le système de perte d'objet qui est juste pénalisant si on ne possède pas d'abonnement online...",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Tikur,13-06-2022,"First the obvious one.
This game looks simply terrible. The environment with their Pokemon gets boring after a while and the only really aspect of the game is ""gotta catch them all"".

There is a story, however it is another basic pokemon story although there are this time some highlights. The problem is, after the main story, the motivation to keep playing falls down rapidly.
Because after the main Story with Dialga/Palkia the only thing which is left for you to do is catching Pokemon to complete your Pokedex so you can finally face Arceus.

So to summarize it.
The game only has two gameplay elements. Catching Pokemon and loot material to produce items and tools which helping you to catch Pokemon. The battle system is simple and boring compared to the main titles of the series. It is far away from being the big step forward fans were hope for.

All in all it is with shining pearl and brilliant diamond a very average Pokemon title. Which is not worth 60€.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Fyshra,19-03-2022,"After giving my thoughts time to settle I think I can safely say Legends Arceus is a very good game.

Admittedly I wasn't even going to play this, after the massive slap in the face BDSP was, I felt supporting such a soulless company wasn't what I wanted to do anymore and instead I would go support a different soulless company because let's be honest they're almost all soulless, but after hearing how good this was from personal friends and people online alike, I decided to shill out another £50 to GameFreak and to my surprise, I absolutely fell in love.

At the time of writing I am yet to 100% the Pokedex and fight Arceus but I've done everything to that point so I feel comfortable writing this now. Arceus is a great and very fun game, not everything GF tries lands, for example some of the new evolutions are dreadful, looking at you Sneasler, the game is still VERY easy, and the story is still forgettable, but it does what SwSh failed to do in my eyes, and that is to make a cast of very likeable characters, I felt this cast was really good, you're still a mute loser with no impact but unlike SwSh your character makes several facial expressions depending on the situation, which probably shouldn't be so impressive but hey, baby steps. Other fun characters include Kamado, your towns leader and ancestor of Prof. Rowan, The Diamond Clans leader, Adaman, who I love very much, The Pearl Clan Leader Irida, Cynthia ancestors Cogita and Volo, both are interesting especially the latter, Arezu who, if you'll allow me to indulge my weeb side for a moment, is best girl and my waifu, that hoodie + tights combo just does it for me, and finally your rival, Akari/Rei, depending on your characters gender, both are pretty fun though. These are some pretty fun characters and given I've struggled to remember the names of half the characters from Gen 6-8, including SwSh which I finished like a week ago, I'd say it's a pretty good testament to these characters when I can remember their names off by heart.

As for gameplay, it's probably the best part of this experience, being able to freely toss a poke ball at Pokémon and catch them seamlessly is a childhood dream I'm sure most of us shared, along with firing a Kamehameha blast and being Batman. Not only is the new gameplay good, GameFreak did the impossible and actually IMPROVED the standard Pokémon gameplay, Pokémon attacks are actually fully animated, and they CONNECT to enemy Pokémon, it's really standard stuff but goddamn I never thought I'd see it in Pokémon and I'm just happy GF are listening more than anything else.

As for the games story, uhm... you get Isekai'd now go discover some funky animals and fight god. That's kinda it. Can't say I was expecting much from a Pokémon game for story and this is pretty serviceable but considering all the improvement they've made to other areas of the formula the story kinda sticks out as being worse by comparison.

Now for the games flaws. Like I said the story feels stuck in the 90's, it's pretty boring and shallow, completing the Pokedex is also kind of a chore and some Pokémon have some pretty ridiculous evolution requirements which feel totally random and like they require the internet, how are you meant to know to use Psyshield Bash in Agile style 20 times with Stantler? That's stupid and I wish that kind of ""heard it on the playground"" sh*t wasn't here. The game also still suffers from real bad pop-in and textures just being real lazy with when they decide to load in, I know this issue has persisted for a while but every game it remains it gets a little more unforgivable each time, I pray they sort it out by Violet and Scarlet. I suppose you'll want me to talk about the games graphics now...

So that's Legends Arceus, not a perfect game by any metric, but a very fun one and one I've spent 60 hours on and intend to spend a whole lot more, I really hope this is a new beginning for Pokémon and not a one-off success.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
VantheSloth,23-02-2022,"I've played about 40 hours of Legends: Arceus. It's a good game. Is there a lot that could've been done better? Absolutely. Are there some things they should've expanded upon? Yes. Is it a step in the right direction though? Certainly.
The gameplay is arguably the most important aspect of a game, and I am happy to say that what Legends: Arceus provided is strangely satisfying. When looking at trailers, you may be concerned that the environments have nothing to really explore. This is somewhat true. The terrain can be a bit dull at times, but there are also times where you'll find yourself wandering into this hidden corner of the map, and you'll be rewarded by various things. Even when the terrain isn't too interesting, you'll find that the Pokemon and items you pick up will make up for it. When it comes to the Requests, it can be a bit mixed. Some will be really interesting, slightly comedic in an almost Pokemon anime fashion, or wield some cool rewards. Others, however, will just leave you looking up how to complete it on your phone due to it just being a boring scavenger hunt. I don't mind having to look for stuff, but I think some hints that would narrow down where to search would've made the experience a lot better. The battles with Noble Pokemon can be surprisingly difficult, and has a very consistent difficulty curve. The only one I have issues with is in the Cobalt Coastlands, and that's mostly because the arena makes it feel like you're fluffing your way through it until you finally manage to somehow beat it. It was still fun, but it could've been better. The one in the Alabaster Icelands has to be my favorite. It's hard, but it's a fun type of hard. The trainer battles are, for lack of a better description, interesting. At the beginning of the story, it's very basic, and comparable to Sword and Shield's battling. By the time you get to the post game though, it leans more towards the ""almost unfair"" territory you'd expect from Cynthia in Platinum, and arguably beyond that. The battling itself has changed a lot in this game, and my feelings on it are a bit mixed. On one side, it adds a bit of strategy that was appreciated, on the other side, it can seem a bit unfair and annoying, especially when some Pokemon out-speed you right out the gate. The new status effects are actually pretty cool, and I wouldn't mind if they were implemented into Generation 9. The crafting is also a nice touch, and surprisingly well balanced. Overall I give gameplay an 8/10.
The story is fairly average, until you get to the post game. A lot of it feels like it could've gone deeper, or been explained with less presses of the ""A"" button. I think two things that Game Freak should learn in the future is to show rather than tell, and to not repeat a single point several times. It's better than it was in Sword and Shield, but it still needs some work. The last plot point in the post game was definitely worth it though. The story is a 7/10 for me.
Do not expect the best in Legend: Arceus' graphics and animation. Some terrain from far away can look downright ugly, and not properly portray what's actually out there. For instance, if you look at The Heartwood from The Heights Base Camp, almost all of the trees are nonexistent. The anti-aliasing can also be really weird at times, especially around water. The animations department is actually a bit better in comparison. It isn't quite Monster Hunter levels, but most of the animations are good enough to keep you immersed. There are times (mostly while doing requests) where it's somewhat obvious that they took some shortcuts, but it's nowhere near as bad as Sword and Shield. 5/10 for graphics and animations.
The music is one of Legends: Arceus' high points. It's blissful when you go into The Heartwood or traverse the lands at night, because the music just brings you in. Sometimes you don't want to battle Pokemon just so you can hear some of these tracks without interruption. There are two tracks that play in the Cobalt Coastlands that takes me out of the mood though. ""Cobalt Coastlands 1"" and ""Cobalt Coastlands 1 (Version 2)"" are references the Diamond and Pearl's ""Route 210"" track, and while it fits Diamond and Pearl's tracks, it doesn't really fit the feel you get in the Cobalt Coastlands, which is a ""nice, chill day at the beach, but with a pinch of danger"". The music has more of a ""sprint to the adventure ahead"" sort of feel. There are also times where I felt that the ""Battle! (Wild Pokémon)"" track got a bit repetitive. Maybe if there were slight variations depending on where you were, that would've made it a lot better. There was also this one trainer battle that I wish had some more dramatic music to it instead of the normal trainer theme. All of these are nit-picks though, and didn't in the way of my enjoyment much. An 8/10.
Overall, I hope that Generation 9 and future Legends titles (if there are any) improve upon this and make something truly great. There's promise here.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

While the new, open world aspect of the game allows for a much faster, more enjoyable game, a large portion of the game just feels like empty space. The menus, combat, and inventory has never been so streamlined and efficient that makes Pokemon much easier and quicker to digest. It allows you to experience the fun parts of the game much easier.

No es una obra maestra, hay juegos como Ratchet & Clank (2002) que son mejor en cuanto a rendimiento, hay juegos de mundo abierto mejores (The legend of zelda breath of the wild), hay juegos con mejor historia.

Otapic,31-01-2022,"I've been playing Pokemon since Emerald, and yes I do like the step that they're going to with this game.
But out of sheer love for the franchise, I just can NOT ever recommend this game considering how much it costs and the actually quality AND quantity you're getting. I was hoping to be able to give a pass to the horrid graphics if the world itself had something compelling to do in it.
But no, what i got was sloppy excuse of mish mash of terrain. Right now i can't even bare to finish it, the game doesn't keep me hooked. Especially not with how grindy the progression feels.
The research part is a great and certainly something most fans wanted, but putting it as the only way to progress the story just makes it feel like a chore.
""No gamefreak, i don't want to catch this pokemon for 267th time to progress this subpar story""
And moving on to the story, it was alright. But again that damn research system shouldn't be the main part, just like the pokedex in previous games it should've just been a side objective that you slowly progress AS you play through the game not vice versa.

Now let's talk about the world, if you could even call it that. You know what the open world feels like? Like they spat on my face and said deal with it. Let me ask everyone else who's played, can you name atleast 5 places on the map and say something interesting about them, take away the pokemon roaming around and ask yourself was any of the wilderness area memorable? The answer is no

And now the roaming pokemon, what else is there to say. They're basic AIs that just so happen to look like pokemon. I'm not expecting a complex simulation of their ecosystem, but they didn't even try to improve on it after SwSh (Sword & Shield)

Finally i have to reiterate, i love Pokemon. But rn as things stand, i don't think gamefreak feels the same love towards it.

Overall the game is a 5/10, there are good ideas and at least some hope for a better game in the future. But right now Pokemon Legends: Arceus feels like an unfinished, half assed game, with uncooked but great ideas. Do better gamefreak, do better.

Unrelated rant about parts of the pokemon community:
Like ordering a steak in a Gordon Ramsay restaurant and getting raw beef, you like steak but the chef didn't bother to cook it. You're disappointed by the result but you see everyone else eating the raw beef just because Ramsay did it. You decide to not eat the raw uncooked beef, but everyone else in the restaurant glares at you because of it. That's what the community feels like nowadays, I'm criticizing the games cause i want them to do better. I have no ill intentions, but everyone else feels ok and satisfied with the status quo while demonizing those who are actually passionate and love the pokemon games, ones who want to see it reach it's full potential",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Ceiosillo,01-02-2022,"El juego es muy, muy disfrutable si no eres alguien que se fije en los pequeños detalles. Así de simple.

Adictivo y entretenido, con mucho lore sobre la franquicia, mecánicas nuevas bien pulidas y los nuevos Pokémon (o al menos, las nuevas formas) son geniales casi todos.
Sin embargo, no puedo evitar fijarme en los casos extremos de popping que se van dando frente a tus morros allá donde vayas y como, aún acudiendo a técnicas de optimización extremas como las que se usaban ya hace mas de 25 años para juegos de la 64 como ocarina of time el juego no es capaz de tirar a mas de 30 justitos FPS con bajones en ciertos sitios.

Nintendo necesita sangre nueva. Siempre estará el señorito de turno argumentando que ''solo llevan haciendo juegos 3D desde la sexta gen'' (Hace prácticamente una década ya) y que ''no tienen experiencia como otras compañías''... Pues que contraten gente talentosa que hay ahí afuera con sus miles de millones y los pongan a optimizar el juego para que cargue por completo al entrar a una zona, que no debe ser imposible viendo lo que ya han hecho otros videojuegos en la misma plataforma.

Ish90,04-02-2022,"Es lamentable que una de las franquicias que más dinero genera saque a la venta un juego así. Es inadmisible que solo por ser Pokémon haya que conformarse con un juego mediocre que no aporta nada más allá de un estilo de juego a lo Monster Hunter , que no es realmente un mundo abierto y no están inventando nada que no haya ya , sacrificando un apartado gráfico, lleno de popping, bugs y que es peor que el de Wii, un apartado sonoro repetitivo e inexistente en algunos casos . La historia flojita con unos diálogos que no llevan a ninguna parte puesto que la elección del diálogo es una falsa ilusión, con personajes inexpresivos y sin gancho. Un juego con poca dificultad y mucho texto, cuyo mundo abierto, resulta vacío con un pueblo lleno de casas copiadas y pegadas, la innovación en el sistema de juego está bien pero no sacrificando todo lo demás .

El juego es disfrutable, y si es el camino que van a seguir los próximos juegos de Pokémon estará bien siempre y cuando no repitan los errores de este, gráficos, diálogo, dificultad, etc.

Es un éxito solo porque los fans de Pokémon nos conformamos con cualquier basura. Y no debería ser así, desde el punto de vista de consumidor deberíamos exigir más. It is unfortunate that one of the franchises that generates the most money releases such a game. It is inadmissible that just because it is a Pokémon you have to settle for a mediocre game that does not contribute anything beyond a Monster Hunter-style game, which is not really an open world and they are not inventing anything that does not already exist, sacrificing a section graphic, full of popping, bugs and what is worse than the Wii, a repetitive and non-existent sound section in some cases. The weak story with dialogues that lead nowhere since the choice of dialogue is a false illusion, with inexpressive characters and without a hook. A game with little difficulty and a lot of text, whose open world is empty with a town full of copied and pasted houses, the innovation in the game system is fine but not sacrificing everything else. The game is enjoyable, and if it is the path that the next Pokémon games are going to follow, it will be fine as long as they do not repeat the errors of this one, graphics, dialogue, difficulty, etc. It's a success only because Pokémon fans settle for any garbage.

While the premise of the roaming a Pokémon world is a dream come true, it soon turns into a nightmare, the technical shortcomings are too glaring and take you out of the experience. Gamefreak is not known for developing graphical marvels, but with game the graphical gap is too evident. Textures are one of the most poor I’ve seen on Switch (and I've played a lot Switch games), some of them are beta prototype quality, really bad, shadows are blocky at the point you can see the pixels like they would come with prerendered blobs instead and it could look better, draw distance is abysmal, you can see warping geometry a few meters from your character, on top of that the memory management is awful, not allowing keep in memory far objects that pops out nowhere, draw distance for objects, NPC, grass, trees, landscapes are all terrible, when compared to a game like Xenoblade Chronicles you will only end with a deep sadness.

Aelio,02-02-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is more of a tech demo that experiences with new mechanics and quality of life features for the pokemon franchise than it is a fully fledged AAA title.

PLA's main draw is that it attempts to shakeup the pokemon formula by modernizing the pokemon experience to more closely match what pokemon catching would be like in the real world and how it is depicted in the anime series.

There is clearly some effort put forth here in executing this new formula, but just like almost every other recent iteration of pokemon, there are obvious signs of neglect and corner cutting.

The most obvious signs of neglect come from its lackluster visuals. Graphics aren't everything sure, but in a semi-open world game where exploring the environment and catching pokemon is the main draw, how the world looks is an important aspect of the overall experience.

Not only are the graphics sub par when compared to other titles on the same console, it doesn't even match the graphical quality of games from 5+ years ago.

Now, if sub-par graphics are used to make up for hinderances due to performance that can be more understandable but that is not the case here.

PLA has much less taking place on screen at any given time than many other open world games and it's also not technically an open world game as each individual area you explore is a restricted sub-set of the overall world based on what mission/objective is chosen from the ""Town Hub"" which is also the only town you'll be visiting.

Given the restrictive nature of the ""open world"" and its sub-par graphics, it could still look better if simply more was taking place on screen. For example, if there were more trees, more grass, more pokemon, etc. even if the textures looked the way they do, there would be better immersion overall.

Instead, we get poor graphics, a limited world, and barren empty environments. All of that being said, this unfortunately doesn't equate to better performance. The game still suffers from performance issues and pop-in.

Aside from visuals and performance, the game itself has a repetitive gameplay loop.

There are no dungeons in PLA, no real puzzles, no interesting caves, there are pokemon and there are more pokemon and your only job is to throw balls at them and/or fight them.

Not having IVs/EVs, breeding, competitive battling, held items etc. removes a huge aspect of replay-ability and purpose from the game.

Not having any interesting, nice-looking environments to explore, no puzzles, and no real challenges aside from making your character roll to the side make this overall experience very lack luster.

Some would probably say that only ""hardcore pokemon fans"" would like this game but I disagree. I think there are plenty of hardcore pokemon fans who simply recognize this games flaws and are able to acknowledge this is not the definitive edition of pokemon or what we all wanted.

If you like simply catching pokemon, reading lots of dialogue, exploring empty worlds, not having any real motivation or purpose aside from completing checklists, then you'll likely enjoy this game.

For everyone else, you're going to be disappointed. I would assume though that the majority of the more critical gamers and pokemon fans already know this.

I give GameFreak credit for trying something new but this is not the kind of pokemon experience I ultimately wanted. It's scratching the surface, it's getting there so to speak, but it's still lacking a lot of charm and polish.

Given that this game has, I believe, only been developed for roughly a year or so, what they've managed to achieve in that time isn't bad necessarily but to call this a AAA Nintendo Switch title and to charge full price for it is disappointing.

Again, if going back on the visuals and limiting the explorable world to small sub-sets at a time were for performance reasons, they didn't achieve their goal.

The world is a bland, uneventful, empty, barren place. There are pokemon in it so, there's that but after you hide in a bush a few times, dodge roll some attacks, and throw a few pokeballs around, you've literally experienced the entirety of this game.

There is a story sure, but it's somewhat irrelevant and is largely just tedious and not immersive enough given the state the rest of the game is in.

Now maybe GameFreak will be able to use this ""Tech Demo"" as a starting point to create future titles and maybe in doing so we can expect/hope for more polish in the future but the point here is that PLA doesn't really add all that much to the pokemon franchise and the overall experience it offers is very lackluster and generic.

I think part of the reason PLA is getting as much praise as it has is due to the fact that pokemon fans are literally starving for innovation. Coming from the 1:1 remake that is Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, it makes PLA look revolutionary.

It looks like it was made by someone who has 0 experience in coding, artwork, or story writing, and greenlit by a greedy executive just looking for a paycheck.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Fandralake,02-02-2022,"At its core it is a singleplayer game with creatures to tame and fight as you explore the world to ultimately complete your catalogue of creatures and unite the people in this game.

It is an ambitious undertaking considering this is coming from a developer that has put content first over graphics and story in their previous games.
The issue comes from the simple fact that it doesn't accomplish its own goal. It is a much wider scale game with little to do. The general gist of the game is to catch and collect all the pokemon of a region before moving on to the next to repeat it again. It becomes repetitve very quickly and stops being enjoyable after a few hours. The lack of variety in its creatures really kills the momentum the first few hours of free roaming gives you, not to mention its better by its own standards story. The npcs seem more fleshed out than evr but the series from the very beginning has had a low standard. And thats what bothers me the most, i wouldn't be laud a developer for doing the bare minimum lesser developers do every time they release a new game. They took a step in the right direction, dont get me wrong. But to veer from their own formulaic games just to give us a barebones look of what pokemon should have been when it came to console just drives the point home that the series has gone on a downward spiral for quite some time. This reeks of a demo of qhat they could be capable of if they actually tried. Im talking about voice acring, new pokemon region, actual caves and dungeons to traverse, landmarks to see and people to find and give quests this feels like a prototype to something truly great and until that comes i cannot say i like this game.",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC
SaltyMaud,03-02-2022,"Core gameplay loop is running from one resource node to the next while capturing each pokemon at least half a dozen times. Sometimes after stuffing their ass with berries first, sometimes after throwing ""balls of mud"", sometimes doing the same, but stealthily. I don't know who this appeals to, but it's not me. The zones are also void of any landmarks or points of interest, each zone is just a handful of vaguely different biomes littered with materials to gather and pokemon to catch - it's basically a few different wild area zones, and frankly the DLC wild areas in SWSH were more interesting than these. Different pokemon species behave like each other - you got hostile pokemon that seem to spot you from way further than you can even lock on tho them, you got skittish pokemon that run away and despawn when they spot you, and you got neutral pokemon that don't give a sh*t but that's the extent of variation in pokemon behavior. The ""boss fights"" are ridiculously easy, and the AI is so basic it can get itself stuck in level geometry. There is no way you'll get hit by the telegraphed attack patterns more than once. Side quests are mostly fetch quests. There are literal hours worth of dialogue, none of it voice acted. You'll probably mash B through most of it. Scaling through the story is a bit wonky, there isn't much of a reason to put effort into your team when whatever the next zone offers is usually stronger and higher level anyway. Or you could just bruteforce capture alphas and be way overpowered to anything you'll currently face.

Battle mechanics have been heavily bastardized for this game. ATB turn order turn order means turns are no longer taken simultaneously, resulting in situations where you may find yourself in a unfavorable matchup against a much faster pokemon, and you don't even get the chance to switch out before the enemy takes one - or more turns. The game is missing like 70%+ of moves, and the remaining moves have been simplified to fit the battle system. The list of missing battle features continues, there are no: priority moves, abilities, held items, weather control, terrain, hazards, speed control, multitarget moves and more. Moves that alter attack or defense now affect both physical and special, stat changes are now limited to a single stage, and they only last for a few turns which is an odd change for sure. Status can also now be overridden by another. There are no pvp battles, but you wouldn't want them with these battle mechanics anyway.

There are some good quality of life changes, like the ability to swap out learned moves on the go, instead of having to visit the move reminder. On the other hand we have lost mobile access to PC, and we can't fast travel between zones. First you must return to base camp, load into town, leave the gates again, load into the zone and then move to your location - because just flying directly to any point of interest like in any other pokemon game would have been way too convenient.

The game is pretty poor looking on a technical level, and the artstyle is inconsistent which is a shame, if the game stuck to the artstyle it could have looked decent. Soundscape is also pretty barren and the sparse use of background music doesn't help to hide it.

PLA is different, I can respect that. But it's also in a lot of ways just straight up worse than previous pokemon games and it doesn't stand on its own as a openworld-esque rpg either. If you want to observe pokemon, play snap. If you want to battle pokemon, play SWSH. If you want a open world RPG, play BotW. PLA has some aspects of them all, but does it very poorly.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Vandalboss,02-02-2022,"A great idea executed poorly, with so many other gorgeous games avaliable on the switch it stands to reason a game by Gamefreak should look at least similar. Instead it barely hides its stuttering fps issues and subpar graphics with the collecting of pokemon its had throughout its series. The new gameplay is stunted by the glaring issues the game has at its foundation. The fundamental flaw is lack of variety, when all is said and done there is no replayability to this game after finishing the pokedex. There is no multiplayer battles, no rebattling trainers, no new pokemon after completing the regional dex, no breeding mechanics and no other goals left. Ehat you have left is a barren world rife with monsters youve already have caught over and over. Which brings me back to the flaw of lack of variety, a measly 242 pokemon to catch with the small amount of actual battles you get to experience reduces your options for actually USING your pokemon to only a few instances, you will be seeing your mounts more than you will ever see your own pokemon in battle. Another aspect that i find irritating is the amount of design taken straight from breath of the wild, from its menu options to its game hud it ends up emulating a much better game as if to remind you you could be playing THAT instead. It tries so hard to be something it wasn't to begin with and then trips over itself in presentation.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC

But there is still a long way to go.,7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Speedie,01-02-2022,"You may want to stick this review out. It's a rollercoaster ride.

There are two driving forces in this game. One force that takes the game in either direction. In the direction of being a good game, there is the amount of fan service in the game. New forms of Pokémon, an regional origin story, new strategies to collect Pokémon, Breath of the Wild menus, sounds, and gameplay. The negative driving force however is how long it takes for the player to be able to enjoy these things.

It isn't as if the player is always learning new things that they must use in the gameplay. The opposite actually. Almost everything needed to complete the game is handed to you right off the bat. This is not an inherently bad feature. This kind of freedom allows each player to create individual experiences and choose their own way to complete each task. Sadly, in this game, there are no choices to be made. It's simply a game where you build your collection, with new environments only serving as a change of scenery. Even then, the same forest area is used for a majority of three out of five areas. Finally, the graphics are unacceptable. This is something that can be looked over when we talk about quality, since gameplay is most important, but it's a sad thought when you realize every once in a while how poor the graphics are.

With all of the complaints somehow, someway, this game made me return to my desk and continue where I left off the night before. Why was I coming back? What kind of game do I turn on and start complaining about? Freedom. For once, you aren't just a Pokémon Trainer. You're a collector. A researcher. The one that others look up to. You are the obstacle in their way from the very start. For Pokémon fans this story is one they've wanted to know for so long, and want even more of in the future. It's Pokémon history being played out and created by you. The most important thing in the entire game is collecting and studying things about Pokémon that have never been such a large focus.

Effort. That's what this game has. It's not the norm for the developers. It's unexplored territory. They made their mistakes, the game has it's flaws, but it has the soul that a good Pokémon game should have. They didn't leave out crucial features to make the game more marketable to wider audiences. They didn't make the story simple so everybody could follow it. It's a huge chapter in the Pokémon world and one that's worth experiencing, even through the flaws in it's core. As fans we all have our opinions about this game, but this game will absolutely be built on in the future, and is a foundation for the future of fun in the Pokémon franchise.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

ChioUyuni,01-02-2022,"Me gusta ver como Game Freak intenta cosas nuevas, pero porque algo sea nuevo no significa que tengamos que cegarnos ante sus fallos. El bucle jugable a lo personal ha sido muy divertido, cada vez que llegaba a una nueva zona era increíblemente divertido capturar todo y ver que habría en la siguiente zona. Las peleas con bosses están entretenidas, nunca llegan a ser realmente buenas (A excepción de una muy tardía). Tiene cambios de calidad de vida que recibo con los brazos abierto. Y eso sería un poco todo lo bueno, lo malo por desgracia me pesa muchísimo. Aunque es divertido investigar los mapas por los Pokémon, me gustaría que en ""Leyendas"" hubiera, bueno, Leyendas. Ruinas explorables interesantes capaces de contarnos cosas de este mundo, cuevas, algo de trama contada por el entorno y no solo por NPC's. Ver algunas de las ruinas más interesantes de Platino trasformadas en literalmente un cuadrado donde un npc te cuenta cosas... Es doloroso. Tiene ideas buenas constantemente que no llevan a nada o son desaprovechadas, sobre todo cuando sus personajes son relativamente carismáticos, al menos más a lo que nos tienen acostumbrado, pero de nada sirve si las tramas son cutres maniqueas o desaprovechadas. Que te hagan viajar al pasado para descubrir las leyendas y únicamente encuentras que te hablen de Leyendas más antiguas es realmente desesperanzador. ¿Por qué una nota ""tan alta"" entonces si tengo tantos problemas? He jugado 91 horas, es indudablemente divertido. Es cierto que está algo inflado por cosas como recoger las llamas para el Spiritomb, lento y tedioso pidiéndote TODAS para conseguirlo y siendo necesario para el ""Verdadero final"" al completar la pokedex. He atrapado todos los Unows sin que eso sirviera para nada.

Jt0429,02-02-2022,"Pros-
This game has some of the most addictive and well designed gameplay loops I have played in a Pokémon game. The game allows you to be curious and encourages it more often than not and it feels very rewarding for just exploring the map. It adds so many new quality of life updates and changes like the battle mechanics are expanded. These changes are long overdue for the Pokémon IP and it works really well in the games favor. The music is amazing and is so pleasing especially in battles and just wandering around the open world. The story this time around is surprisingly decent and kept me invested. The Pokémon formula is changed for the better and it really works in the games' favor. Also the actual Pokémon have an actual personality and it is very refreshing to see.

Cons-
Honestly, this game is really ugly looking at most times and the graphics are just not up to par even for a switch game. There is a lot of jank in the controls and it takes away from the experience. The game does have a certain lack of polish that I am sure will be somewhat fixed but at release the polish or lack thereof definitely is noticeable

Conclusion-
All of the problems I mentioned are a problem and I wish Game Freak was given perhaps a few more months to iron things out, Even though that didn't happen, Pokémon Legends: Arceus is one of the most well designed and compelling Pokémon games ever and is able to overcome those shortcomings. This game is the game Pokémon fans have been waiting for years for and for the first time in years I think the future of the franchise is looking bright",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Lumber_Jones,04-02-2022,"I love this game, I think it is one of the best, if not the absolute best, Pokémon games that has ever been made. I also think it will be a contender for GOTY which will be a true achievement for this game and the series. I am scoring it as I have because they seemed to stop working on the game at a point and just accepted it where it was.

On the Narrative: This game has a story which loosely makes sense. it's interesting, it captures the imagination of everyone from the newest trainer to the most hardened veteran. but there are parts where it just doesn't seem to go far enough. Each boss fight feels repetitive with no ""real"" mechanical changes present in them other than the monster you are fighting. There are parts of the game where the narrative does genuinely tug at the heartstrings and make me as the player feel that I am an in a real world with people in it that I should care about. But also after the initial scene of you waking up on a beach in a completely different time/era. There is basically no mention of trying to get home. I understand that the point of the game is in-fact to catch Pokémon. But even if at some point during the collection of the research something was mentioned along ""the more we learn the closer we are to figuring out how we might be able to get you home"" would be more dynamic. It all feels a little lazy and like they couldn't find a way to start the story so they just through in you coming back in time.

On Gameplay: really the gameplay is incredible for a Pokémon game I don't feel like I'm just making these incredible creatures fight for no reason. Instead I can just catch Pokémon in the guise of research and then release them as a regular part of the game. it is a truly amazing step for the series. every throw of a pokeball feels great, and each time I craft something en masse I get a little shot of serotonin knowing that I made my own pokeballs. However for some reason that is never explained narratively or visually I appear completely unable to climb even the simplest hill. nor can I swim for some reason. the reason for these hinderances as a player are obvious, they don't want me to access the areas early when the Pokémon are stronger. but at least make it visually or narratively interesting. Can't make it up that hill? it's because it's too steep and you don't have climbing gear, or maybe it is raining so it's simply to slippery to climb. You can't swim because Pokémon will attack you, or maybe because you as a character don't know how to swim. at least give me a reason for these road blocks in a game which proudly calls itself ""open world""

Final thoughts: THis game is a tremendous step forward for Pokemon as a series. it adds a new breath into something which hasn't truly experienced new-ness in what feels like over two decades. I hope that they take this side series to a new area in the future as well, whether that means an ancient Hoenn region, or perhaps ancient Alola. ANYWHERE BUT KANTO. I also hope that whatever the next ""main series"" game is it borrows from at least the innovation in the gameplay so that Pokémon are seen less as competitive tools, and more like the subjects of research that the game proports them to be.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

La exploración y recolección de materiales para el crafteo se hace tedioso por los constantes ataques de Pokémon que se encuentran en la zona. El juego ofrece algunas ideas buenas y que se deben mantener de aqui a futuro (libertad de la camara, el sistema de captura o el crafteo con un zurrón cuya interfaz bebe mucho del Zelda Breath of the wild y se agradece), pero carece de otras muchas cosas y su falta de pulido en todos los sentidos impide ver el potencial de esta nueva fórmula.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

AsrielDreemur,01-02-2022,"I'm nearly 20 hours in when I'm writing this review, my first impression for this game is that it's probably the most unique pokemon game by far. The fact that GameFreak decided to try something new in a Pokemon game without reusing the previous pokemon formula really impressed me. Overall the game wasn't really mind blowing but it did laid the groundwork for future pokemon games.

There are some other stuff to be work on such as the visual and graphic. Voice acting in Pokemon is always somthing I wanted in the game and it's kinda disappointing that they continue to overlook that aspect. Although I love the new game mechanics of catching pokemon that was implemented, I felt that the map in this game is really empty and lifeless at times. The missions in the game could be tedious at time when they force you to catch ""X"" pokemon in a ""X"" amount to progress.

All things consider, it's a good Pokemon game that could have been better and I hope that GameFreak will continue to improve their future Pokemon games as they are going down the right path with Pokemon Legends Arceus.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

JonnyDante,02-02-2022,"Okay Pokemon offers a slightly different gameplay. Which in itself might appeal to one or the other. However, the game is overrated in my opinion.

There is not just one billion dollar company behind the game here, but two. So I can't rate it well. For 60 euros I expect quality in every respect.

Okay Pokemon bietet ein etwas anderes Gameplay an. Was an sich vllt dem einem oder anderen auch gefallen mag. Allerdings wird das Spiel meiner Meinung nach viel zu hoch angepriesen.

Fer1678,28-02-2022,"Legends Arceus is a pretty disappointing game.
The game has solid mechanics, but they have a lot of problems, and it's pretty likely they'll be forgotten for next games.
It's unacceptable how the game actually limits the player in simple things like swiming, which is a human capability, I get that being helped by Pokémon for every simple task is something that comes all the way from 1st gen Pokémon games, but this game seemed like the perfect opportunity to change that, making the player interact in more ways with world the player is in, making exploration and catching Pokémon more enjoyable.
My next point, the Pokémon battles are the same. Trailers hyped a lot of people by showing new refreshing battle mechanics, making it look like it was going to be more than just moving the stick and pressing the A button ... That before seing the reality. Once again, you are limited to a pretty repetitive turn based combat, and once again, I can see why people actually defend this because that is something that... Well, has been in Pokémon games since the very beginning, but I think I can speak for a lot of players when I say I would have liked to see and play with a different battle style.
Graphic-wise this is mediocre. I can't see why people actually say it doesn't matter or actually say it is Nintendo's hardware fault, just take a look at BOTW, or some pretty heavy ports like Doom, Doom Eternal, The Witcher 3. Seeing forests with the bare minimung account of trees is disappointing, and it affects immersion. Some areas look plain, with almost no Pokémon to be seen until they pop out of nowhere. And no, I don't say this game needed Ray-Tracing or 4K textures, but as I said, just taking BOTW, that game looks much more solid in graphics.
Once again, Gamefreak reuses 3Ds' Pokémon models, those that have come all the way from XY, and now they can't justify it AGAIN saying they wanted to make Pokémon look ""better"", because they are lacking animations in the world asides from walking, swimming or moving the 3D model with no additional animations from the ground to a tree... That until the Pokémon disappears. This game has less Pokémon than Sword / Shield, and that is shameful.
This was the perfect game to add voice acting, and I can't see why they can't do it, it could save immersion, make the game more enjoyable and actually help convey the emotions of the characters, but once again, they didn't, making the game feel plain, literally wasting somewhat of a decent story the game is trying to tell. A lot of games, even f2p games have high quality voice acting.
Nintendo Switch has shown to be capable of more than this stuttery mess. And I can't believe this game took ALL of Gamefreak's attention, making BDSP as bad as they are. These two recent Pokémon games have made me see that anual releases may not be the way to go if we want to see decent quality again in Pokémon games.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

We all have seen the poor graphics and all the mechanical problems of the game, but I've never expected that they would not even use a single braincell to think about world design.
The town is completely blocky, undetailed and ugly, simple to the spine. The world is absolute emptiness, there's nothing to do besides the main mechanic of the game, throwing balls. An entire premise of an hostile world and how humans started to get along with pokemon thrown onto the ground and spit on because of lazyness. I can't believe how its worldbuilding makes absolute nonsense while being so basic and poor. Inside the little thing they did, they did wrong. It's formidable.
I don't give it a 0 because the HUD is fine and captures in real time, aswell being able to move while being in battle are fun and a good integration in Pokémon games. But even this is totally wasted because leaving the mechanic there and not exploring it further. It becomes repetitive and just a scourge.

Phuz,24-07-2022,"Well lets start with the village. The music, I could literally haul myself out of bed, boot up my PC and knock up a better song in around 30 minutes. And that is on the generous side. The village song is repetetive, not good to listen to and made of about two sounds. Who did you commission for the music? Fisher Price?

Next the characters, all of them. Dislikeable, annoying and completely void of personality.

The visuals I don't care. They're not great but visuals don't make, or break for me. The gameplay loop. I just didn't enjoy it. As with Pokemon Sword this is the same, in that it is very difficult to get in to whilst playing Cybersleuth. I'm not a huge monster collecting fan but it does fascinate me and Digimon is great. Pokemon has just been dire. I mean 2x £40 games and they're **** So just as with Pokemon Sword I am yet again going to lose money trading in some half baked game. I have so many eshop games, some as low as 99p that are better than this.

I love the music from the old Pokemon games and started playing the new games for that reason. What do I find though, the energetic music replaced with some washed out crap version and on this occasion just crap music.

If you want to collect monsters and are older than 6 then just but Digimon Cybersleuth/Hackers Memory. Half the price and twice the enjoyment.

Again I'm going to have to drive when I'm ill, to lose money exchanging a piece of **** game.

PurifierUnit,30-01-2022,"IGN Italy's review is the most accurate critic review of this game. That reviewer understands how to analyze game systems and how they interact with one another, instead of just being mindlessly wowed by an open world with a few genuine improvements to the traditional Pokémon formula. And there really are some improvements. They simply seem to have been made without any consideration whatsoever for how they affect the rest of the game.

Let's start with the good. Non-random, seamless battles are great. Want to get into a fight with a wild Pokémon? Toss out one of your own Pokémon near it and bam, you're in battle. No loading screen, no battle transition effect, just instantly in battle mode, and you're still free to move around at will while the battle is going on -- see it from any angle, even get hit by the attacks if you're careless with where you stand.

Don't feel like battling? You can catch Pokémon without being in battle now, which is great. Not all of them, mind you, but some of them.

These are the two main alterations Game Freak made to the traditional formula. They're good ideas. Unfortunately they have some noticeably bad knock-on effects, which it seems Game Freak either didn't notice, or compensated for in rather amateur ways.

Previous Pokémon games had the luxury of hiding all Pokémon in tall grass, and (outside Sword & Shield) never actually showed them in the wild. This means the presence of the Pokémon is part of the player's suspension of disbelief. They're there and they totally have all the behaviors listed in the Pokédex, but you just never see them. Legends Arceus, on the other hand, shows the Pokémon in the wild. And they just...stand there and wander around a bit. They don't live in the world. They have no homes, they have no behaviors, they don't interact with one another -- they simply exist and wait to be caught or fought. This, much more than the obvious visual-fidelity issues, makes the world feel lifeless and oddly empty.

Out-of-battle catching speeds up the game to an insane extent. If you could catch everything without fighting it, the game would be over extremely quickly, and Game Freak needed to not let that happen because of the large number of people out there who equate Time Spent with Money Value. It seems Game Freak has implemented two ""solutions"" in order to prevent the game's runtime from being drastically shortened.

First, Pokémon fall into three categories: friendly, skittish, and aggressive. Friendly Pokémon can be caught out of battle with no special requirements; just throw a ball. Skittish Pokémon can be caught out of battle, as long as they don't see you first (they'll run away). Aggressive Pokémon cannot be caught outside battle whatsoever, and must be fought and captured in the traditional manner. Game Freak has made MOST Pokémon aggressive. They made a super convenient change to the formula and then set things up to force you through the traditional formula anyway, for the most part.

Secondly and far more damningly, the Pokédex requires multiple catches, multiple victorious battles, multiple observations of Pokémon move use, and other checklist items such as ""catch without being seen"", before a dex entry for a specific Pokémon will be ""complete"". There really is no reason or justification provided for what amounts to repetitious busywork; it seems obvious that this is another ""solution"" to the problem of ""we made playing the game faster and more convenient, but we need to keep them playing for roughly the same amount of time as before"". Catching is faster now? Require a lot more catches instead of just the traditional one-and-done. Battling is controllable now, and not at all randomized? Require a specific number of battles for each Pokémon so the player HAS to fight them multiple times anyway. And worse, virtually everything in the game revolves around dex completion, which never gets any more interesting or complex over time. Sidequests ask for complete dex entries outright, or for things you do to complete dex entries. The main quest also requires dex entries. It's a one-note game loop.

Game Freak could have done much more interesting things with its good core changes. Make the Pokémon appear to really live in the world. Require the player to observe and record their behaviors: what they eat, where they live. Use the Switch as if it is the dex itself (similar to how BotW treated the tablet as an actual in-game device), and permit the player to directly record dex info, perhaps with fill-in-the-blank fields and a selection of pre-written answer options. In a game where the dex is so central, interesting things to do with the dex seem like a no-brainer. Unfortunately Game Freak settled for ""just make them do the usual stuff, but way more"". The end result is a decidedly repetitive, lackluster game. I hope Game Freak figures out where it went wrong here, as it really isn't hard to see the holes.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Gameplay:
So first off: the first hours of the game are great. New Experiences, nice ideas and the whole setting is great.
But: after the first hours this game is just a grind. Everything is repetitive and it gets boring.

World: the world is just boring, no mysteries & nothing to really explore. Besides this the graphics are awful. The citys are all just copy and paste and the pokemon in the world are acting like robots.

Also is the game on the technical level like a N64 game (bad animations, bad rendering, ....)

So lets sum it up: Pokemon is finally progressing but not nearly enough. This game would be okay for like 30$ but not as a full price title. Of course some players will have fun with the game and they like to just grind the same things over and over again but this game is far away from being good. We shouldn't forget that this is not an Indie-Game (even if it looks like one) - this game is from GameFreak and its one of the most profitable franchises of the industry.

Is it the best story? no but then again i wasn't expecting naughty dog story telling levels i honestly wasn't even expecting to be into the story at all.

There are plenty of new surprises in this game and i wont spoil anything. if you don't care about graphics at all then this Pokémon game is for you other than the weak weak weak graphics this Pokémon game is a easy 7.5. we need to stop trying to make excuses for game freak this company makes too much money to put out games that look like a launch ps3 game if breath of the wild, Splatoon 2, Mario odyssey, Metroid, new Pokémon snap and pokken can look amazing on switch so can future Pokémon games.

MovieGuy999,29-01-2022,"Legends Arceus, as just a game without its franchise, would definitely be mediocre. It is a collect-a-thon with some QoL elements, a serviceable plot, subpar graphics, and a musical score which, while charming , is a bit too subtle in the overworld. The fact that it has a full game price tag would definitely turn some people away.

With that said, as a Pokémon game, it is pretty damn good! Not GREAT but GOOD. The game's new focus on it's old ""catch em' all"" motto has turned out to be for the better. Why? The best way to describe why is to address how this game deals with the complaints previous entries have received:

Same Old Gyms and Championship? No and no. Your exploration of the world and your capturing of Pokémon now serve as the goal posts for your progress.

Trade Evolutions? Gone with an in-game item.

Animations? While the models and art style of the world are worse, they are more expressive than I remember them being in both BDSP and SWSH.

Too Many Cutscenes/Dialogue Boxes? Plot is to the point: catch em' all and do quests to advance! You will not be kept from the game for too long at any point.

Level Capture Block? Gone! Not to worry though, catching a strong Pokémon is not going to suddenly break the game for you. The one thing that is still restricted are the level limits of your Pokémon obeying you. Catch one out of your league and it will not listen to you.

Too Much Experience? While you do still have EXP Share, it's distributed better and more sparingly. If I can catch a Level 40 Rapidash in the starting area due to a fluke and only get a few levels, I'd say it's pretty balanced.

Grinding sucks? The focus is on catching and that is where most of your EXP is going to come from. Just sneak and throw, no long battles necessary (except in certain cases). You can battle but...

Battles suck? This game gave one hell of a boost to your opponents. They can abuse the special mechanics you can use and the strength in level differences is not as pronounced now. You have to play smart since the combat isn't just single turn switches anymore.

Listen, if you wanted a Pokémon game that would erase all of the past controversial entries, this is not that game. It is very fun but, as many people rightfully think, this could have been done sooner and better. Still, I can't help but really enjoy this game. Maybe it's just a one-time thing but I sincerely hope that the fun I am having now is a sign that Gamefreak is going in the right direction with its game development.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
majr,31-01-2022,"After completing the game and spending about 25 hours in it, I sadly have to say it is a hard pass on a reply. I wanted to like it....I tried to like it....but the only reason I even beat it at the end was to say I did. A lot of small things overall irritated thought out my time playing this game, that will be excused cause it is not as buggie as other ""AAA"" titles. I will give it all the credit in the world for being playable, but it's sad were in a age where that is a thing.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

GraduateBard97,31-01-2022,"I honestly really disliked legends of Arceus, and I think i'm just done with mainline Pokémon for a while. Aside from the technical issues that we all knew would be coming, the game just isn't fun. The catching got really boring for me after a while. The weaker mons just went in and it felt like a chore to battle everything else. At some point it felt like ""why am I just fighting these Pokémon, there's no reason my ultra or great balls shouldn't just be able to deal with this"", which left me wondering why i was bothering to even engage in the dex.

The game is also horribly unbalanced. With your ability to catch alpha Pokémon, if you catch one then you basically sweep till the next power up, then you sweep again. Rinse and repeat. The alpha Pokémon are so far ahead of everybody and everyone else it makes the game a massive breeze. Sure you can self inflict rules to not catch them, but honestly, it shouldn't have even been an option. The mons offer good enough rewards defeating them, they should have been uncatchable mini bosses.
The pokedex honestly feels like padding. I'm glad its more involved, don't get me wrong, its an improvement, but the option to go further than research level 10 is nothing more than an excuse to get you to play the game more, it doesn't offer anything substantial and nothing you can't get going well below research level 10 on every Pokémon in a given zone. Now instead of simply completing the dex, the player for true completion must watch a magicarp use splash 100 times, watch the tackle, ember, fire wheel, and almost every other move's animation dozens if not hundreds of times. You must catch every Pokémon a minimum of 15-25 times, for many more because you need to catch them while they're unaware of you, watch Pokémon eat food who knows how many times, beat Pokémon with a certain type of move a ton of times (which adds to the problem of seeing repeated animations) and this is far worse than other Pokémon games because you can't disable battle animations, and its required to beat the game.

The world is probably the worst part of the game. I'm not talking about the look (although I also dislike the art style), but the actual play world is just bad. Its so empty. There is nothing to do in each zone other than catch Pokémon. Nothing to look at other than Mt. Coronet, nothing in the world to interact with that's fun. There should be more to do than resource gather or catch, I want to have fun things to do while I'm engaging in the main game. It feels like a parred down version of what it could and honestly should be. Every zone feels the same. While yes, one zone is swampy, another is cold, and one is the sea, they feel the same to explore. The only reason I remember differences between the zones is because Its so fresh in my mind. In a few months its going to all blend together. If I recall correctly, there was a pathway in the first zone that went up and to the left (might have been the 3rd), and that reappeared in the snowy zone. Not a pathway going up and to the left, the exact same pathway. It had the same side, same slope, same geometry, same everything.
The art also looks bad. I don't mean graphically, I don't care how it looks graphically, I mean the art style. The game is bland, boring, and really uninspired. Its clear they were trying for ancient Japanese art, but it doesn't translate to the game at all. Compared to other games on the swtich with more inventive art styles, and other Pokémon games like unite or xd tournament, the game just feels like a smear of brown with some green and blue mixed in. The fan made stuff looks better than the actual game. I honestly think it should have looked like the end of the reveal trailer, that would have been fantastic.

The characters are all also super bland. Its the same issue with the zones, in a few months, they're going to blend together again. I'm not expecting a story or characters in Pokémon akin to xenoblade, but I am expecting something more, especially since this Pokémon game is the most story and character driven game since gen 5. I can honestly say I will remember gen 6 characters better than these ones, and its because they had distinctive designs.

The game did improve on the PC (mass release), moves, seeing the true size of Pokémon on the overworld, and evolutions, I think all of those should stay. I like those.
I also enjoyed the boss fights. The main draw for me was interacting with Pokémon in the overworld, and they were a fun way of doing that while also showing the destructive might of Pokémon, and showing how truly dangerous they were.

The final thing I really enjoyed was the time the game was set in, learning about Pokémon with everyone else, and watching as people are afraid because of how little they understand about Pokémon is a really fun thing to experience, I just wish the rest of the game was as good as that.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC
C_Digital,31-01-2022,"If we are honest in the graphic section it leaves a lot to be desired and is even boring and cancine at times, the Pokémon Legends arceus I understand that it seems very good because of the new fighting mechanics, however they continue to drag certain problems from the sword and shield series I do not deny that the game is fun or that we are facing a great game created by Game freak, however I could notice how this game was not made with the love and affection that accompanied the Pokémon games",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Masrani,30-01-2022,"Also sry, ja Pokemon macht mal was neues aber dennoch ist das Spiel nicht fertig. Ich erwarte von einer Millionen Franchise Marke wie Pokemon mehr als nur eine mehr schlecht als rechte Kopie von Monster Hunter Rise Elementen. Das Spiel hat eine Unterirdische Grafik und selbst für die Leistungsschwache Switch ist das nicht ok, siehe MH, BotW, Xenoblade chronicle etc. Ich verstehe auch nicht wie der Gameplayloop Spass macht, denn es besteht eigentlich nur aus Rollen und Ball werfen + manchmal etwas Kämpfen auf nem sehr einfachen Schwierigkeitsgrad. Dieses Pokemon hat einfach alles Wegrazionalisiert, was Pokemon ausmacht. Es gibt kein PVP, nur eine Handvoll Trainer kämpfen, keine Ligen oder wirklichen Challenges, keinen richtigen Plot (hatte Pokemon nie aber man hier ist die Story echt flach) usw. Die Gelbcolorierten Boss Pokemon muss man auch nicht bekämpfen, es reicht zu Rollen und dem Vieh ein Säckchen an die Birne zu werfen dabei wirkt es nicht sehr fordernd.
Das Spiel bietet eigentlich nichts ausser Grind, da du x-mal dieses Pokemon fangen musst, x-Beeren geben sollst und x-mal dieses Pokemon Person A-Z zeigen sollst. Die hohen Wertungen, kann ich nur verstehen, wenn sie von Casual Spielern kommen, welche leider ausser den Mobilegames keine wirkliche Gaming Erfahrung besitzen. Ich sage nicht das Spiel kann einem nicht Spass machen aber für mich jedenfalls ist dieser ewige Grind und die Wiederholenden Aufgaben mit der minimalistischen Grafik und der etwa 20h beschäftigungs Foltertherapie nichts.

Positiv: - Was neues probiert

Negativ: - Freche MH Rise Kopie von Mechaniken (Map mit Biomen, Quest Dorf, crafting, etc) in viel schlechter
- Unterirdische Grafik
- Wiederholender langweiliger Loop und Grind
- keine Voice Ausgabe in 2022 (Das wäre doch mal ein Fortschritt)
- Nur etwas mehr als 200 Pokemon
- Keine guten Funktionen aus älteren Teilen übernommen (Mega Entwicklung, Schwierigkeitsgrad, Pvp etc)
- Reduktion der Attackenmovesets auf ein Mimimum
- Kein Multiplayer
- Framerate einbrüche aus der Höhle
- Wird sich verkaufen wie heisse Schokolade weil halt Pokemon drauf steht

Hyoren,30-01-2022,"Here me out, I love Pokémon, I’ve been playing for over 20 years, all the mainline games.

But I have to be honest and objective to myself. I’ve been playing, and playing, and playing, for 15 hours. Is it a bad game? Not at all, but I don’t think it’s good either. My main complaint is battles, they are completely ruined, the system is just all over the place, there’s absolutely no balance, I hate the new “styles”, I never use them. Pokémon in battle attack you twice something just because (NO styles used), sometimes even 3 times, abilities would help with battles but they don’t exist etc. I just feel like battles are a complete mess.

And that’s wild Pokémon battles, because proper battles with trainers don’t exist (you have some battles every 10 years with a trainer who uses 1 freaking Pokémon, 1!)

The areas are “too big” imo. It’s not a bad thing, but it’s extremely confusing and sometimes annoying and I lose interest on exploring because everything is the same but with a different Pokémon walking around. I know some people love massive open areas, but it’s not my cup of tea, I like something more in the middle.

The crafting is annoying, way worse is the satchel limit, that you have to pay a TON of money to get just 1 more spot for an item… wtf.

I won’t talk about the graphics, we all know they’re not the best, and they didn’t really bother me, for me it was other stuff that was worse than that, as mentioned before.
There’s way too much talking, nonsense talking, way too much. I find it dumb af you can’t go from one area to the other, you HAVE to go back to the camp every single time, to request to go to the village, and then again request to go to another area. That’s just dumb and a waste of time, can’t believe they pulled this on us.

You can’t change Pokémon and access to your objects to store them, it is mandatory to go back to the camp (again) to do so, not much qol there… and don’t even get me started on losing a ton of objects when you pass out.
I absolutely miss BATTLES, real ones. I absolutely miss GYMS, having a more “marked” objective, and go to the Pokémon League etc… some people may like the type of game Legends is, but Pokémon has been always about battles, gyms, the league and being a Pokémon master. The best.

I play when i’m bored, when I stop playing, it takes a lot for me to go back to the game, doesn’t really hook me. I force myself to play to at least finish it (game wasn’t for free).
I have to say I love the overworld Pokémon and the possibility to see shynies. I like the battling when you just send the Pokémon and that’s it, it’s very quick and I appreciate that.
I personally hope this is just the typical spin off game, it hurts to admit I had way more fun with Sword and Shield. I hope Gen 9 takes the good mechanics about this game like the overworld pokemon, quick in and out battles etc, but it’s more focused on the typical gyms etc… and not so massive areas.

Is is the “best Pokémon game everrrr!” as some people say? Hell no! It’s not even the main essence of the franchise. It’s not bad, but not the best either (at least not for me, give me back my competitive battles and gyms).

I would give it a 5/10.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Cupcake214,30-01-2022,"Pokémon is slowly turning into a cheap JRPG. The graphics are shockingly bad with a very poor frame rate, the tutorial lasts for over an hour and that’s with rushing through dialogue.

The world is barren and has very little atmosphere, and nothing worth exploring.

xXCDRageQuitXx,31-01-2022,"Definitely a weird Pokemon game.
The bad:
The graphics are bad and they only get worse
The story is not very good and the lack of voice acting, considering the graphics, doesn't do the game any favours
The game wants you to complete the Pokedex but a couple of really BS long term collectathon puzzles that artificially pad out time
Most of the best parts of the game are locked to after the credits or even 50 hours in.
The story is gated by Pokedex progression

The good:
Exploring areas and finding new Pokemon is fun
The game has made filling the Pokedex a significantly more active task
The new battle system is better and creates closer and more strategic battles
The final act of the story is enjoyable
The soundtrack has some genuine bangers

Pokemon Legends Arceus asks you to complete the Pokedex fully to unlock the whole game to be able to then turn around and appreciate the value of what you played, but a big if here is ""How many people are really going to do that?"" at least 80% of players are not going to reach the very end and are as a result going to leave this game having experienced a mediocre story with an enjoyable final act. Some players will reach the end of the post-game story quest which genuinely has an awesome conclusion and is honestly challenging, but very few are going to reach the very end.
This game is rich with little optimisations to the Pokemon formula. The rocks and trees that you throw your Pokemon at to gather resources for crafting are a great system. The ride pokemon that allow you to travel faster, over water, and through the air or up mountains, is a great system. The addition of Strong and Agile Style and the Move Order really make long battles way, way better. Once you get a grasp of how to work the system it is excellent. The cheeky moves you can do and your opponents will also do make battles significantly more even fights than ever before. It is unfortunate that very few trainers in the game have large parties of Pokemon that allow the system to shine. Crafting is great, for the most part wild Pokemon behaviour is great. The Pokedex challenges that change from Pokemon to Pokemon keep the game fresh. The boss fights are a good idea that has a lot of potential, but some of them didn't land this time around.

This game is brought down so much by its graphics and GameFreak's pulled punches. The game is simply ugly. The ugliness of this game never relents and is at all times making the experience worse than it could be. Textures are constantly being reused, Pokemon load distance can be fine but it can also be abysmal, with Pokemon loading only if you're a few metres away if you're flying over. It feels like GameFreak hasn't tried, and that this game is more so a pitch to the playerbase, asking ""How does this new gameplay loop feel?""

To me, this game has landed well because I've always enjoyed the catching pursuit of the game. I want to see where this game takes us. Gamefreak has done some excellent things with this game and from here it's a matter of trimming the fat like the artificial time-sinks or the story progression gates, and refining what else has potential here. Battles go largely unsung and that is a shame, Pokemon feel more alive than ever in their environments, boss fights are pretty cool, the story was one of the best Pokemon stories and it really wasn't good for the most part. Improve and add more of these parts of the game that have potential and eventually we'll have a great game.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

WithFieryTruth,05-02-2022,"You all probably know what's good about this game already, so I'll go ahead and just list some negatives that have impacted my overall impression of it.

- Subpar graphics. Breath of the Wild looked way better than this back when it was released, five years ago.
- Low framerate. It's 30 at best, but often far below that.
- The camera is constantly shifting on its own, and there's no way to make it stay in place.
- Empty world. Aside from pokémon wandering around and some farming points, there's nothing else to find anywhere. No trainers, no points of interest, no treasure chests, etc.
- You can't switch pokémon inbetween turns in battle.
- Story NPCs and wild pokémon can fight you using several pokémon at once, but you're stuck using a single one even in those battles. Having to go 1 vs 3 isn't uncommon.
- Unless you're fine with wasting precious money to buy poké balls, you'll have to craft your own. This, in turn, means that you'll end up having to farm resources, which is more than a little tedious.
- To actually add a complete entry for a pokémon in your pokédex, you need to fulfill som criteria, like catching a certain number of that pokémon, defeating a certain number of that pokémon, and so on. It might seem like a fun addition on paper, but being forced to do more or less the same tasks over and over and over again for every single pokémon gets annoying pretty quickly.
- The ""flying mount"" isn't actually flying but rather just gliding, making it borderline useless for travel unless you start off on a high plateau.
- Clunky controls while riding mount.
- Even if you're close enough to an enemy to focus on it, that doesn't mean your poké ball will reach it. You'll often be a few inches off, alerting the pokémon to your presence and potentially make it turn aggressive.
- A lot of pokémon have a very long aggro range, making them impossible to approach unless you sneak up on them from behind.
- Sneaking is extremely slow, so the pokémon you're approaching will most likely have turned around and noticed you by the time you're close enough to actually hit it with a ball.
- If you're hiding in grass and throw a poké ball that then fails to catch a pokémon, you'll be noticed and probably attacked by that pokémon even if you're still hidden and should be impossible to find.
- Boss fights against frenzied (yellow) pokémon are godawful. The dodge mechanic is clunky at best, and the window of opportunity for sending a pokémon in to fight the boss after it's been injured enough is frustratingly narrow. Unless you do it basically the same second the message pops up on screen, the poké ball will just bounce off and the boss will recover. What this means is that you'll usually be stuck slowly whittling away the boss' entire HP with throwable items.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Vamos a pasar este tema rapidito porque es el que más destaca a simple vista, pero no es ni de lejos el mayor de los problemas, los gráficos y la dirección artísitca, los pongo juntos por el simple hecho de que mi opinión sobre los 2 es la misma, lamentable, las texturas están sacadas de un juego de ps2 (y de los mediocres), aun por encima el juego es horrendo visualmente, no es ni bonito de ver, tiene una paleta de colores horrenda, lo único que es decente es el cielo, que está bien, FIN.

El mundo, Jesús bendito menudo insulto, ""mundo abierto"" pero que va, llegas al pueblo, que viene siendo el ""hub"" entre misiones e investigaciones, llegas a la puerta y, sorpresa! Te sale una pantalla la cual seleccionas a la zona de capturar que quieres ir, a lo Monster Hunter, pasémoslo por alto, porque claro, vamos a explorar al menos una zona con detalle e interés, bien, la primera zona es una pradera y puedo contarte lo que encontrarás, 3 tipos de árbol diferentes, montañas que delimitan la zona, una textura de suelo PLANA, mineral al cual le tiras un pokémon y lo recoge, lo mismo con los arboles que dan bayas, rocas de adorno (iguales) y por supuesto los Pokémons, tiene un interés nulo, no hay secretos, no hay zonas que llamen la atención, la distancia de dibujado es ínfima, es que es una cosa que de verdad, lo ves, y jamás dirías que está hecho por una compañia millonaria a todos los niveles, es una falta de respeto a los fans alucinante.

(Para los que ponen de excusa ""es que es la Nintendo Switch que es una patata y los gráficos pues cojean"", claro, es que el Monster Hunter Rise o el Zelda salieron para PC y por eso parece que están 2 generaciones por encima, tanto por gráficos, como esfuerzo en hacer un mundo interesante que explorar, este pokémon esta más cerca de un pokemon snap con una mínima historia y quitando los raíles que de cualquier otra cosa.

Ya he opinado sobre la saga en su momento, y tengo que reconocer que la idea de este juego me gusta, capturar los pokemons de forma más ""salvaje"" explorar el mundo si este fuera interesante, y los combates iniciándolos sacando tu pokemon al mundo directamente, fluye, pero es que es tenemos que exigir mucho más a una franquicia gigantesca, me encantaría que siguiera por esta línea, esta idea de juego, el problema es que el siguiente será otra aberración porque saben que venderán una locura haciendo lo mínimo posible por los fans que se hartan a soltar 10 y 9 solo por ser Pokémon, a otra compañia no le permitiríamos esto y lo sabemos.

CONCLUSIÓN:
Si mañana me dijeran que el juego lo han hecho un estudio desconocido que se dedica a portear juegos de móvil me lo creería sin dudarlo, parece un early access en una versión muy muy temprana, pero no, es la franquicia más grande del mundo riéndose en tu cara.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Aurawhisperer,30-01-2022,"The game is promising, but not really worth a full $60. The graphics are poorly optimized still - Sword & Shield actually looks better. No promising change on the battle system with exception of you as the trainer moving around - thus, taking out the multiplayer was completely unnecessary. Dumbed down to 242 pokes in the region, which may upset alot of other trainers. Catching mechanic lacks potential - cut the middle man between traditional & Lets Go. Stealth mechanic is poor - better off just catching on foot or battle. Story is an average Pokemon story, with minor grim tales. Abilities & Natures no longer a thing, but EVs/IVs are still in the game despite no competitive battles.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
M3inKampfycouch,30-01-2022,"Legends Arceus is an expensive tech demo through and through. Through the past several years in the transition from 2D sprite work to 3D models GameFreak's made the risky move of turning Pokemon into a console title. With that shift has come a noticeable drop in quality, particularly in the department which manages the compatibility between titles. Sword and Shield had a reduced Pokedex and rather sparse content and Legend's Arceus follows suit by delivering a really unique playstyle overshadowed by a game generally devoid of content. The ancient world of Sinnoh is bland and misses a lot of the diverse biomes that typically populate a Pokemon game on top of generally feeling empty as a whole. If you love Pokemon you'll probably still enjoy this game as I did but I can't shake the feeling this game should've released as a free demo with the team dedicating more time to fleshing out the world, the missions and the overall Pokemon experience. I'm not sure if GameFreak is just looking for a cash grab or has just grown plain lazy but Legend's Arceus will hopefully not set a precedent and is just paving the way for a much better game down the road.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

pokemonmaster9,28-02-2022,"The underrating shouldn't not be everyone, only E10+. What's with the rating pending, and this could be harmful for little children.

The story is like parental guidance, and the gameplay is like Monster Hunter World or Rise, like open-world or zone. The game frame rate is not enough to adjust 60fps and 1080p, and the graphic is too similar as Sword and Shield. However, the music, open-world area, and quests that I like is much better. Like music, it was very calm and peace that I can relax my brain without expressing anger. I can believe you don't have enough strong graphic and frame rate is because I'm very disappoint that you put low quality. Even though you compared the Breath of the Wild, the only you compare is Monster Hunter World and Monster Hunter Rise. IS this a hub system?!

The battle mechanic is not bad, strong and agile is much combination, but I'm confuse about the turns. Also, the moves were too small, so I am disappoint that all the moves about 75% are gone!!!!!
The difficulty of battling is tricky and everyone thing they can't win a higher level, like post-ending, it will start over without check point. The 3d modeling is doesn't make sense, like Pokemon has different colors and it's confusing (think it is shiny). No more trade evolve, YAY!!!!!! The fans think the trade evolve would get stolen and refuse to give it back. I'm impress you add new items, like linking cord.

Returning to quest, the money is too low, and the rank progress is too slow when progressing the story. Also, wasting poke balls that you catch is a limit amount, and you'll waste and buy it again.

I think the Game Freak is using the same graphic that the AAA's are having a technical issues, rather than finding a good engine to create their own by themselves. Also, it wasn't not much fun with a multiplayer.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Holden89,30-01-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a bold new step by Nintendo and Gamefreak that would have been outstanding several years ago. PLA does a great job of making you feel like you truly exist in the Pokemon world and does a good job immersing the player through all of the new mechanics it presents.

Catching new Pokemon is more dynamic than it has ever been before. You can choose the old route: start a battle, weaken the enemy, then attempt to catch them, or you can utilize the open world and items you have at your disposal to distract, feed, or even stun them and simply throw the ball. It is even possible to use this method to catch ""Alpha"" pokemon unaware and capture them without need of a battle.

There is an all new crafting system as well. While it is quite simplistic it does get the job done. I found myself going out into the wild simply to gather materials for crafting. Action to reward. Basic. Good job. The game also goes a solid job offering newer, more powerful items as you progress to make it seem like you're actually improving as a member of the survey corps.

Story wise, it's what you'd expect from a Pokemon game. Solid enough, keeps your attention for the most part, but nothing remarkable. There's no ""wow"" moment in the story nor are there any moments that elicit much of an emotional response. Towards the end I was skipping dialogue because I just wanted to ""play the game"".

The battles themselves are largely the same. The ability to run around was interesting for the first couple of battles but after that I forgot you even could and stopped doing it altogether. There's no real reason to move around outside of seeing different angles. Pokemon don't randomly target the player character in battle and as long as you don't stand directly between the Pokemon fighting you're safe from harm. Some status conditions did get updated which felt long overdue.

Now, the bad...

The game looks terrible. The game runs terribly. Unacceptably awful for a full fledged console game in 2022. Jagged edges, frame pacing, models popping in and out of existence, and several graphical glitches plague the game and severely hurt the score. It is either time for Gamefreak to find a new game engine or for Nintendo to find a new developer. This does not cut it. To be clear, I like the art style they tried for. It could have been a very aesthetically pleasing appearance but it just isn't. It is ugly and is very poorly optimized. The retail price of $60 does not reflect the amount of polish put into this game. Very disappointing presentation for Pokemon on the Switch. Again.

All in all, I greatly enjoyed my experience and will likely playthrough the game several times. I know in this world of hyperbole and dramatics a 7 seems like a low score. It's not. This was a fantastic step in the right direction. Ball is in their court to improve upon it.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

OnlyOneHere,30-01-2022,"I'm shocked that the developers didn't continue the Pokemon tradition by cutting the game in half and selling it separately, in a pathetic attempt at making players pay more than $60. I am also surprised that even at their most generous moments, the developers still manage to be more greedy than some of the most greediest developers in the video game industry. The greedy developers are charging $60 for a game that looks like it was made for mobiles. It doesn't even have the AAA quality to justify the $60 price tag. The graphics are a joke. The textures are garbage. When I look at some of the rock textures, it literally looks like it was ported from a Game Cube game. That is embarrassing for a 2022 $60 game.

The animations are garbage. The running animations are cringeworthy. The rain effects look laughable. There is nothing to do in the open world. Just an empty world full of plants, rocks and empty hills. That is so boring to explore. For goodness sake, why doesn't this video game series still have any voice acting? Unbelievable that there are still $60 games with no voice acting in 2022. The developers are too cheap to pay for voice actors. This outrageous greed makes EA and Rockstar look like saints in comparison. At least they put voice acting in their $60 games. Speaking of voice acting, the voice acting of the animals sound like they were done by the developers themselves, in a pathetic attempt at keeping the budget low for this game. The physics are beyond horrible, especially the water physics. The story is trash. The combat is boring and repetitive. When I pay $60, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. The soundtrack is terrible.

There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is not a reason to touch this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. All you can do is trade Pokemon with your friends. The developers were too cheap and lazy to allow us to have Pokemon battles with our friends.

Moves looks good. Pokémon idle is alright. And the models are some of the best. For the story, there is one. Nothing to exciting. Like in past Pokémon games, it’s very basic. For people rating this a perfect 100/100 are insane. As for the ones giving this a 0/10. This is a very average game, which I think is an honest review.

Me da muchísima pena que Pokemon esté llegando a estos niveles de mediocridad gracias a un estudio como Game Freak y gracias a los fanboys que se conforman con cualquier mierda. Y si, la switch tiene suficiente potencia para mover DOOM Eternal, no me jodas. Hay que recordar que es un juego AAA y que se vende por 60 eurazos.

BakedWafflez,30-01-2022,"Very disappointed in this game, this was the first game I bought on release day in over 5 years and was really excited about it for months ahead of time. After about 15 hours I’ve put the game away and have no real desire to pick it up again. It is super repetitive and doesn’t even feel like a Pokémon game. I’ve had a total of 10 battles against other trainers at most and they all had like 1 Pokémon each. To me Pokémon has always been about creating a good team, leveling them up and battling against others. Without the battling aspect I feel like there is no point to the game. I don’t even remember what Pokémon I have in my party because im not even creating a battle team, I just hold on to them and complete various research tasks, level them up to evolve, complete more research tasks and then cycle through other Pokémon. It’s a shame to because this game introduced some wonderful battle mechanics like strong vs agile moves, the ability to switch out your move set outside of battles and then takes battles away and makes this a game all about catching Pokémon. Might as well be Pokémon snap, I’m very disappointed I spent money on this game, I was already getting nervous because of the time period it’s in and being told there are no gyms or Pokémon league but didn’t think they would eliminate the core of what is a Pokémon game and that’s creating a team and battling against other teams.

I’m not even going to mention the art direction and the graphic issues because everybody has seen it. It can still can be a very enjoyable experience though, but this is definitely not “the best Pokémon game in years”, it’s not even close.

Dranakar,30-01-2022,"This game is such a let-down, so much so that I submit my first review to metacritic.
I will say, I've loved pokemon since red/blue and even though this is a step in the right direction I am not going to congratulate them for innovating 15 years too late.

TLDR: Grindy, not great-looking, handholdy fetch quest that is detached from the idea of you caring for the pokemon you catch - the game.

I'll assume the game starts at a score of 10 and we can see how it progresses shall we?

Firstly the game puts you on rails for 2 HOURS in an unskippable tutorial that starts and stops every 5 second to do another cutscene. And you can't turn off the waypoint marker, cause you know, who likes exploration and figuring things out? (-2 points)

The grind is unbelievable and it requires you to grind to grind endlessly to progress between areas - so an arbitrary grind-gate instead of a challenge you have to overcome. If that wasn't bad enough they've somehow gotten the idea that catching 1000 identical pokemon is exciting and wholesome, it's not and never will be. (-3 points)

Boss battles are all the same, using some weird TPS system where you throw bags at them, and have to dodge just at the right time, so now we're skipping pokemon battles entirely? (-1 point)

Dialogues have non-options until you choose the ""right"" option. If there is only 1 option don't pretend like I have 2 (-1 point)

The world feels and looks plastic-like. This is an nintendo-only developer that has access to reach out to BOTW team, there is no excuse to look this shoddy. Furthermore traversal in the environment is quickly eliminated with uncontextual fast-travel and a steed that rides the entire map where-ever you are in < 1min. ( -1 point)

Everything you do in the game is a fetch quest, which as per my last point is trivialized. (-1 points)

adrii9715,30-01-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is a failed experiment BUT a solid and promising begining for a new era of the franchise.
Let's start with the good things:
- The new set-up teams mechanic is pretty good in a way that the movesets are changeable all the time which gives you the oportunity to prepare difficult combats. Note: There are not difficult combats, but for the future is WAY beyond interesting.
- I like the idea of introducing new types of attacks (strong and agile).
- The concept of the pokemon missions is addictive, making the game more enjoyable trying to complete the tasks of your favorite pokemons.
- Capturing is not my favorite mechanic, because i rather combat, but it's pretty satisfying and well done.
Bad things:
- The story and it's narrative is so dumb in a way that the characters are flattering you because you capture a lvl2 pokemon and they couldn't. I mean, you where there for 5min and you did what they couldn't for their entire life, it's just ridiculous. Another dumb thing is the ""Professor"" character. How in the hell can be someone a professor if you just can't study the pokemons? what can you teach? Ignoring all of this, the story just feels like an anime issekai type of story, which is not necessary that bad.
- The game design is so generic, pokemon always had a charismatic look and i don't see nothing about it in this game. The trees, the towns and buildings, etc. just looks like a generic f2p chinese game, I expect more from Pokemon Company. The map looks pretty damn good though. Even the music is generic.
- The new roster of pokemons from Hisui, despite Arcanine, are way worse designed than their original forms. And Arcanine it's not that he's better, just feels different.
- No online PVP. The stats from the pokemon are no longer needed, and thats pitty.
- Let's finish with the more obvious of all of them, the game looks really bad, not only talking about the graphics, which are way below from the standard of the Switch console. I'll not compare it with BOTW (a game lauched 4years ago) but if you do a massive open world, it's important that the ambientation and the world itself works as a hole, in order to get inmersed in it.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Franc15,29-01-2022,"It's fun in the short term, but it doesn't have much in the way of replayability, or even story despite the fact that it's supposed to be narrative driven. Most of the game is catching Pokémon until it's time for you to do the same repetitive task of calming the angry lord Pokémon. Pokémon is no stranger to repetition, but it's less challenging than the Pokémon Gyms in previous games. Those at least had a few trainers each, different puzzles to solve, and Gym Leaders weren't hard to beat, but if you weren't prepared you could lose or just barely win. The lord Pokémon are much easier to beat than Gym Leaders, and it's a much more tedious task. You just throw balm, battle, throw balm, battle again, and throw balms. Or you can skip the battles completely and just throw balms. Even Dialga and Palkia can be cheesed by just throwing balms, and they're some of the final bosses of the game. There's a huge lack of trainer battles in the game. You're lucky to see one every half hour. I'd say it's closer to one an hour unless you're at the few segments in the game where you're forced into back to back battles. There's no post game facility like virtually every other main series game after Crystal, and there are about 240 Pokémon, so very few to choose from in regards to team building. On subsequent playthroughs if you can actually bring yourself to replay the game you'll likely end up using the same Pokémon because there are so few encountered in the first 5 or so areas. There are a decent number of side quests (or ""Requests"" as the game calls them to differentiate from the main quests or ""Missions""), but most of them are simple fetch quests. Bring an NPC x number of y item(s), show them a certain Pokémon or Pokédex entry, etc. and there's virtually no multiplayer besides trading, despite every other main series game having player vs player battles which never detracted from the single player experience. The world is also full of barren fields or mountains that have maybe 2 or 3 Pokémon on screen at best 99% of the time, which is inexcusable because the areas are relatively small compared to other open world games (I'm using that term loosely for this game). Other games of this nature you'll find settlements or structures with characters who will give you quests or you can explore a dungeon. No such luck here, you'll just keep walking seeing the same Pokémon and plants over and over again.

The game is mediocre at best, bad but not terrible at worst. I know bad games, because I've played the Two Worlds games and Sonic '06.

I really wanted to like the game and hoped it would be good, but I was thoroughly let down.

When you look at the world of Pokemon Legends Arceus and compare it to similar games with their worlds like a Monster Hunter Rise on the switch, or even other exclusives like Xenoblade 2, Pokemon Snap, the upcoming Kirby game and Zelda Botw and many more, Legends Arceus looks awful as if this game is a Steam pre alpha game or even a N64 game when you compare some areas with a Zelda Ocarina of Time. There are a lot of pop ups of trees etc, the main town is the only one in game and most houses are just copy and paste, awful environmental visuals, a lot of areas feel very empty and there are also nearly no points of interests for a game that wants to you to explore the world.
Of course there is no need to have a game with next gen graphics or a more realism look, but you have to have in mind that this game is a product of a big video game company with the biggest franchise in the world. They generate millions of dollars and cant deliver a game with a visual standard that fits the size and popularity of the franchise Pokemon. Game Freak has the finances to get help by other studios like every game does nowadays, even a Halo, Horizon etc. gets help by many different studios. The console is not the problem as you can see all the way better looking exclusives on the switch. And when there is a lot of crunch time its a company decision to put the games on the market in a high frequency with just the essential content and visuals to get enough positive scores by media and the games sold.

Overall the game makes quite fun because it uses a fresh optimized gameplay and going another way than the main games, but you have do decide if you want to spend your money for a game that looks like a game that is stucked in the past of the Xbox360/PS3 era or even at some point lower. Compared to other actual games it feels like completely low effort product with no details and soul.
At the end its a decision whether you want to support this course of the company Game Freak or want to see a way bigger change of the biggest franchise in the world.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Jsvr,29-01-2022,"This is not an open-world, nor is it a new attempt. Many Pokemon fans are trying to overestimate the game, saying it has made a new attempt ""for Pokemon."" But I can't give high scores to these games just because Pokemon comes out.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Blentz499,30-01-2022,A good improvement on the Pokemon formula. The gameplay loop is awesome if you're a completionist like me. The things that are being the score down is this game is either unoptimized on the switch or the switch is not powerful enough for the game. I think a mixture of both are true. There is a lot of pop in and I have seen other games that shouldn't be able to run on the switch be able to run quite well so this is disappointing. The other thing is the small Dex size. 240 Pokemon for a franchise that is right around 100 is too small to reasonably charge 60 bucks.,7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Seyta,29-01-2022,"Really disappointed about gamefreak, they make bad games since years and they doesn't care. They always do the bare minimum and never listen to players.
The universe has nothing natural, it's too robotic, the pokemons move erratically, they wander lifeless, no ecology, no wildlife or anything. The devs just created a map and put pokemons here and there.

Niftylen,29-01-2022,"Had to come here and rate this. I thought I would give the game a try given it’s a slight change in formula, and Pokémon games are criminally lazy, conservative, repetitive rip offs. No good, just no good. It makes my mind hurt seeing so many ‘critics’ (aka YouTubers who are afraid of losing their access to early copies / brainwashed super-fans / bribed corrupt gaming media outlets) rating this game so highly. It sucks! I’m not even going to focus on the graphics but if you think they are acceptable in any way, you have no standards in life. This is a console that runs The Witcher 3. BOTW comparisons really hold merit in this department.

The gameplay though, blimey… I just can’t fathom how fans are satisfied with this janky mess of gameplay. It’s like one giant wild area from SW/SH in terms of being empty and devoid of any interest except for the Pokémon themselves. The battles have a new gimmick that barely matters or is completely broken. It’s the same rock, paper, scissors fare with crap animations.

The story is absolute garbage. Surely there has to be a point where even the young kids that seemingly seem to be the audience that holds this series back, get sick of the narratives that they trot out. In 2022 we still have characters just stand there and wave their hands like characters from a 20+ year old Ps2 JRPG exposing about nonsense whilst everyone stands around awkwardly. No one has cared about a Pokémon story for decades, why is there soooo much talking in this game. I can tell you why, to pad it out and make it long. Boss battles are lame. Who thought throwing infinite magic food bags was an inspired choice? That plus half baked dark souls roll dodging, yuck.

If you’re a player who really, really likes switching your brain off and completing a Pokédex, I can see the appeal. But it’s just soooo bad… Awful graphics and frame rate, awful story, bland repetitive gameplay. If it didn’t have the Pokémon label it would be laughed into oblivion.

Why, just why, would you invest your time playing this game, and not amazing games like God of War or Disco Elysium, or heck if you’re a kid, BOTW or Mario Odyssey. If you’ve completed all the great games like these, maybe go out to the park instead, just anything but this junk…

Brilliant diamond got a lot of crap, but some of the quality of life updates made in that game made me have some of the most fun I’ve ever had in a Pokémon game. I really thought features like accessing PC from anywhere and infinite bag space was forecasting what we would have going forward in the series. Nope, they decided to make those things more restrictive than ever. Collecting items to craft what I need is tedious and intentionally time consuming. Clearing my bag because I can’t hold anything else is incredibly frustrating. Those are the biggest things making this game less enjoyable than it could be, but there’s so much more I could mention if I felt like spending hours typing it out. Not a bad game, but could be SO much better.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
YungSadYugi,29-01-2022,Honestly overall it's not a bad game. The graphics are that of a Nintendo 64 game and I can't count how many graphical errors I've ran into.

skjmz9066860,30-01-2022,"Pokemon has generally been going in the right direction; Let's Go and Sword/Shield brought in the 3D aspect that Game Freak denied avid players for years. The system in Pokemon Legends: Arceus in terms of battle and capture is unquestionably superior to every Pokemon game preceding it. The death of the battle screen is satisfying to say for the least. The in-world interaction is a great addition. My issue is, the better looking battles are few and far between. There are not many Pokemon trainers in this game nor are there gyms. If the storyline had induced the building of towns & settlements upon completion that led to more trainers and the first ever gyms the game would have been 1000% more effective. While this game certainly succeeded in putting old and tired mechanics to rest, it failed by foregoing the aspect of competition.My hope is that Arceus will remedy this by way of DLC, and hopefully much more expansive DLC than those we saw in sword/shield. All in all, this is certainly a better direction for the catching, battle, and exploration aspect of the franchise.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Kenmei,17-02-2022,"This is probably the most unique entry into the Pokemon series since its inception. Being able to run around the world, catching and running away from wild Pokemon is a real treat and really gave the series a fresh new spin. It can be a little weird at times due to the controls not being that fluid and can be very clunky if you're trying to switch to a specific item or Pokemon to fight at times but it works very well. The battle system is similar but has its own quirks that separate it from previous entries. The lack of abilities and held items now give type immunities, such as ground being immune to electric and so on, more importance as these wild Pokemon can have very high stats for their levels. Especially Alpha Pokemon who can overcome a massive level advantage to deal significant damage to alot of Pokemon. I had to unlearn alot of standard Pokemon battling tips that I was not prepared for. It's not bad per say, but you might find yourself in a tough spot very quickly if that 20+ level advantage you thought would make up the difference for a neutral Pokemon, who has a special move that your Pokemon is weak too.
I'd almost say this game would be a better experience for people not experienced with Pokemon, but I'd recommend it to basically anyone who might interested. The clunky controls and the usual poor framerate that comes with playing on the Switch aren't too much of a hassle at the end of the day. The game is just fun and I really hope they continue to do games like this in the future.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Too Much Story
I love pokemon legends, the idea of an open world pokemon game where you explore areas, hide in tall grass and catch pokemon or battle them real time is more than I could have ever hoped for in a pokemon game, but let me tell you, the story just gets in the way.. Ask me what happens, I couldn’t tell you… painstakingly boring and just in the way, essentially you fall from the sky, theres a giant rift that you have to close, some pokemon are going crazy, you gotta fix it and of course fill the pokedex… and now were talking, now were at the good part, catching them all, Pokemon legends takes a little over 24 hours to roll credits, however thre are still about 2 to 4 hours post credits of gathering all the legendaries for the true ending so don’t think youre done!essentially you go into an open area, there are pokemon to catch and gather info on by battling, this fills up your pokedex and of course makes your party stronger as you go through the story.. and ther is incentive to actually seeking new pokeomon out and ctaching them with your hand crafted pokeballs, that’s right theres a super simple crafting mechanic here, youl lgather materials as you explore and earn them after battles, you use these materials to craft potions and pokeballs, unlocking new recipes as you fill the pokedex, its so addicting building your roster up, only for the boring story to get in the way, I was skipping through everything I honestly couldn’t care less what was going on, didn’t care to do any side missions.. nothing made me care about anything other than going out and catching them all.. and I really wish this was more of the focus, just let me go explore at my own pace, have crazy hiding spot for rare pokemon, that’s what I want, not lame bioms and checking bak in at the villiage.. but its fine, I still had fun despite the game contstantly throwing speed bumps at me.. and that’s ultimately my biggest complaint, I felt like I was on a chain the whole time compared to the freedom I feel from a mainline pokemon game.. and also, battles… there are rarely any pokemon battles with others in this world, which is probably explained in the boring story I didn’t care about, but still a let down, Im building up a team for what? Just to catch pokemon? But at the end of each story chunk there is a boss battle as well and these are awful you just throw bags of sand at them and dodge their attacks… super repetitive, I would’ve rather just had a straight up pokebattle…
Pokemon legend has a lot going against it, the lame boss battles, the lack of trainer battles, and the god awful story dragging down the pacing of this game… but you better believed I loved the moments I was set free to hunt and catch, there are secrets to uncover, the battling system is fun, you even keep all of your moves your pokemon learn and can switch them out anytime youd like which I love.. allowing you to really play around with move sets or prepare for certain battles..
I would love to see this series take off.

Su banda sonora sigue a la altura y destaca muchísimo sobre el resto de apartados, sobre todo las remezclas de viejas melodías y temas de batalla.
Su sistema de combate es un acierto, sin perder la esencia de lo que siempre ha sido la saga pero con suficientes argumentos como para cimentar un cambio evidente.
Este es el camino a seguir para The Pokémon Company, han creado un proyecto en el qué las razones empresariales brillaban por su ausencia ya que la fórmula clásica seguía funcionando en cuanto a repercusión mediática y que sin embargo han tenido el valor de traspasar una barrera ue parecía infranqueable.

Sunshadow87,06-03-2022,"Probablemente el mejor Pokemon hasta la fecha desde Azul y Rojo en la gb, y siguiendo con esa comparación, con fallos semejantes al original.
Pokemon es seguramente una saga que ha evolucionado y se ha estancado al mismo tiempo, siendo el lavado de cara de Arceus un viento fresco que se agradece. Por fin tenemos cambios, un mundo abierto que se siente vivo y cambiante como mucha gente pedía, novedades en el sistema de batalla y captura, y lo que es más importante, una vuelta a los orígenes que se había perdido para todos aquellos que el competitivo (en el cual no tengo interés) nos la pela: el ""hazte con todos"". Esto último solo es posible en la actualidad con una pokedex limitada y centrando el juego en esta dinámica como aquí ocurre.
Pokemon Arceus es un juego que, al igual que ocurre con otros mundos abiertos como el de Breath of the Wild, te invita a perderte, a explorar y a descubrir, y que en general hará que la misión más simple de ir del punto A al punto B acabe siendo de varias horas al desviarte del camino cada vez que veas algo que te llame la atención y haciendote dar muchas vueltas, pasando al plano secundario.
En otros aspectos; la historia del juego esta bien hilada para ser un pokemon, siendo más madura de lo habitual; el apartado artístico (que no gráfico) es bello y han mejorado las animaciones de muchos pokemons; y el apartado sonoro cumple con buena nota para acompañar la dinámica general.
También merece la pena hacer mención de que ahora los pokemon no olvidan los ataques, si no que mantienen todos los ataques aprendidos permitiéndonos montar un set de 4 a equipar, lo que francamente hace más llevadero entrenar a pokemons para cubrir roles diferentes a dps al ser más fáciles de subir de nivel cambiándoles el moveset.
Pero el paralelismo que hacía con los juegos originales no es solo para los puntos positivos si no también para los negativos: los gráficos son extremadamente mejorables (aunque cumple manteniendo los fps estables que es lo más importante dada la jugabilidad) así como algunas animaciones (de los humanos principalmente), completar la pokedex al 100% (me refiero al 100% de cada Pokemon que es diferente de capturarlos a todos) se hace extremadamente tedioso debido a entradas realmente aburridas y repetitivas como usar X ataque 70 veces que no aportan nada (no es necesario para completar la historia al 100% ya que basta con capturar a todos los pokemon); y el leveleo de los pokemon, aunque es bueno en general, en los primeros niveles quizás suban demasiado rápido, siendo estos niveles donde aprenden la mayoría de ataques creo que le quita la gracia a formar y entrenar a tu grupo aunque ese no sea el objetivo del juego.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

zetzuken,03-03-2022,"In my opinion PLA (Pokemon Legends: Arceus) is probably the most innovative Pokemon game Gamefreak ever created. It's a breath of fresh air for the Pokemon franchise. An open world Pokemon adventure that just feels right. PLA is not perfect though people were disappointed with the outdated visuals but Pokemon is not really about awesome graphics like other franchises. They focus on collecting and doing the moto ""Gotta catch them all."" The gameplay was surprisingly outstanding and the highlight of the whole game. The exploration mechanic was superb and the Pokemon battles and catching mechanic was just a dream. Remember the time when Pokemon fans wanted to just throw the Pokeball in a random Pokemon in the wild? PLA gave that experience in a wonderful gaming package.

The Music of PLA is underrated the 1 person who was in charge of the OST and sound effects needs to get a raise for this. He did a superb job.

If you want to try a different Pokemon game and you're tired of the old turn base battles, formula. You really should give the PLA a try. It is a refreshing take and one of the best Pokemon experiences I had.

When i imagine it with a Pokemon Game, Legends Arceus is how it should be. They nailed the gameplay mechanics aspect, and the research system also adds up to this great game. The story wasn't as bad from other Pokemon titles but the dialogues are skippable. . The story in Pokemon games wasn't always a priority so there's nothing new to it.

Some might say that graphics weren't stunning, but for a Pokemon game, they are (as of 2022). I loved the unrestrictiveness of this game, I always explored each map fully before going for the noble fight. Finding a new pokemon or even a shiny one in wild was a thing I always looked forward to. Dodge rolls, sneaking behind the pokemons were fun things to do, but the fight were remade, and they worked really nice, especially that they didn't teleport you somewhere else for a battle. We just battle at the place we encountered each other, that's just amazing. Boss fights at the start were weird for me, but they grew on me so the finish of Arceus positively surprised me. I completed for research level 10 each of the pokemons (I think I have 3 perfected) and I will shiny hunt some pokemons later as well. Great game, with awesome visualizations and overworld pokemons.

In my opinion this is their best game of all time. Graphics could be better, and I'm still waiting for them to release a game with multiple difficulty levels, but there's nothing to make me think it deserves less than 10/10.

Simoss13,04-03-2022,"I have not played a Pokémon game since Red and Blue. Since watching the cartoons in 1998, I had an expectation of exploring vast lands, fast turned based combat and collecting quirky pocket monsters. After a long wait, I got to play the game I envisioned and wanted.
The gameplay heavily relies on exploration and research which compliments the main story progression. There are 5 large areas to explore and have much to return to when acquiring new mounts.
Although I prefer more track variety, the music is great and fitting to the game.
The main issues I have (likely said by many) is, the graphics. The pop-in does take away from the immersion as it's so constant. But the game overall looks... passable (not ugly but there is better looking games for sure).
The other issue is the control scheme, they seem to make the game clunky and the buttons don't make sense. For instance, press ""+"" (or start) to ride a mount and 'up' on the D-pad to use a menu, why?
The story has an interesting concept, but felt it was executed in a weak way. It was a whole bunch of fluff in dialogue which I struggled to get invested in after the second zone.

The gameplay loop is to gather resources, catch Pokémon, complete research tasks, and repeat. This gameplay loop, for the first 15 hours or so, is very fun and addicting, but by the end of the game, it does not feel as if there is enough variety within the core loop to keep you engaged. Likewise, the side quests in the game are pretty typical and unengaging, which is a huge bummer for those of us who like to complete a game's extra content. The boss battles in the game are super fun - while you still battle in these fights, you also have to, as a trainer, dodge enemy attacks in an almost bullet-hell like way. Although they aren't too difficult, they add a change of pace to the game's main loop and rewards players for thinking on their feet.

WallCrouton,18-02-2022,"As someone who's played Pokemon since gen 1 as a kid, I wanted to see how this new installment stood up to previous ones as well as my opinion as a lifelong Pokemon fan.

The short version is this: I enjoyed it, even with a few criticisms. I had fun, and I actually did Catch 'em All this time.

The long version is: It's a new and interesting direction for Pokemon to go, having done the usual 8 badges + beat evil team for 25 years. Although the catchphrase implied you had to indeed catch them all, it was never the main goal. If you did, you rarely got anything good unless you were shiny hunting, and it was really just for the sake of doing it. So to make that the goal of getting the true final ending of this game was innovative and unique. They took away the pressure of the main path to follow and instead put a lot of focus on discovering all the Pokemon in the region. It also did a good job of making the wild Pokemon feel more dangerous and not just pests.

Now for the downsides... I didn't encounter a lot, but the things I did see are the most commonly talked about. Mainly the graphics. I'm not a big whiner about it, but it was definitely a bit rough sometimes. Mostly when high up, as when you're on the ground catching or battling Pokemon it's harder to see. However, I didn't find that it ruined my experience of playing it. There were also some encounters that were frustrating, involving chasing really fast Pokemon that dashed away as soon as you were in their line of sight. As well, one battle in particular was a huge difficulty spike over any others and was really imbalanced in favor of the opponent. Kids are supposed to be able to play this, and it gave me a rough time, so I can't imagine how much one might struggle against it. Also, multibattles exist but you still only get to use one Pokemon, so you can easily find yourself getting wombo combo'd to death with nothing you can do but watch.

Basically, it's definitely a good game at its core, but could use some polish. If they go this route again in the future, I hope they listen to criticism of this one to better balance the next one.

If you weren't sure about getting this one, I'll say this: If you're a committed Pokemon fan, you won't want to miss it. If you're just looking to play the hot new game and really want pretty graphics, you may want to skip it if you just can't accept how it looks. It's not perfect, but it's good.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Pyronick96,01-03-2022,"Un 10, literalmente es lo que llevo esperando desde que tengo 5 años, la jugabilidad se acerca mucho más a la del ánime que los juegos de la saga principal, es lo que yo me imaginaba que sería un juego de Pokémon antes de tener uno, un videojuego donde puedas estar con tus Pokémon fuera de la pokeball (todos ellos), donde los combates fueran tan dinámicos como aquí y pudieras moverte mientras estos transcurren, poder atrapar Pokémon lanzándoles una pokeball mientras están haciendo cualquier otra cosa distraídos...
Hacía tiempo que un juego de Pokémon me enganchaba tanto y es un grandísimo paso para la saga que espero que siga por este camino y veo que así será gracias a la próxima generación que promete mucho.
Después de terminar este videojuego ya tengo unas ganas terribles de jugar ese nuevo Pokemon mundo abierto y basado en mi España que tanto promete, que ganas de Pokémon Escarlata y Pokémon Púrpura o como me gusta llamarles Pokemon Uva y Naranja o Vino y Naranjito jaja.

A decent story, interesting mechanics, a game loop that is fun and a bit addictive.
A lot of good stuff here that we hope becomes the new standard

BUT... there's also the bad stuff... this games need voice acting, more animations for the main story so the game doesn't looks so outdated... I think this games need some lessons from other games, like Xenoblade and Breath of the Wild
The graphics are decent... but they really need more details, and also a better way to optiimize the hardware of the Switch. (lots o pop in)
And finally... the turns and experience are changed... so this makes some battles, a bit unfair.
If the pokemon is a bit slower and gets oneshot... doesn't matter, the next one is going to have priority because is his turn... it doesn't resets every time a pokemon gets defeated. So the game doesn't favours a fast pokemon with lots of damage... IT NEEDS defence to endure attacks because you'll always get by the oponent... Also... no abilities, I guess it's fine, but they need to return for the sequel.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Lucas359,17-02-2022,"Siendo alguien que abandono la franquicia en la 5ta generación (una de las mejores de todas) decir que poder volver a disfrutar un pokemon no es poca cosa para mi.
Este es el camino que tal vez pokemon tuvo que haber seguido hace tiempo, un mundo abierto donde realmente podes sentirte en conexión con los pokemon e interactuar mas directamente con ellos mas allá de solo los combates, con una mecánicas muy simples pero bien implementadas que van de maravilla con lo que es la franquicia, aun siendo un spin off y no de la saga principal.
Tiene fallas obviamente, el motor grafico es un insulto para los estándares actuales y a lo que la (comprobado con juegos como Zelda BOTW o Luigi Mansion 3) consola puede ofrecer, lo que lo hubiera vuelto mucho mas envolvente en lo visual en la experiencia, pero que tampoco interrumpe la fluidez del juego. La historia es otro punto que flaquea ,mas que todo hacia el final terminando de manera un poco abrupta sin darle casi nada de relevancia al pokemon con el nombre en el juego enfocándose mas al postgame, aunque sin dejar de ser lo suficientemente interesante como para seguir queriendo avanzar.
Un titulo que falla bastante pero que tiene muchísimo para mejorar y ofrecer si se lo trabaja como se debe, el cual Company puede explotar sin que afecte a la saga principal siendo Arceus un spin off que puede derivar en muchas entregas mas de este tipo, volviéndolo una saga. Yo espero que lo sea.

Ludera,17-02-2022,"The game design is brilliant. It's probably the most fun I ever had playing through the game. The fast pace batlle and catch mechanics are the things the hold the idea together. If they were slow, it would be incredibly boring to complete the pokedex, but is quite enjoyable when you can't catch and battle in a matter of seconds, with no intro or unnecessary dialogue.

For me, the fact that the game is not truly open world is not a negative. It would be nice to fly over all the regions? Yes. But it did't seem necessary.

Completing the pokedex being the main goal of the game its great. I tried to play the game without looking for tips and managed to catch every regular mon -- minus Spiritomb and evolving some of them (more on this later). The thrill when I found Cleffa, Grotle and Munchlax -- 3 of the last 4 needed -- was one of the best in 30 years of playing videogames. I think 237 (or 242) is a decent number of pokemon to have in the game. The max they could have gone, I believe, is 300. More than that, would be a slog to get to Arceus.

The last one I need was Cherubi, which I imagined that would be in one of the trees where you can find Cherrim (which I found two while going through the first part), but I delayed because it's kind boring going back to the village over and over again.

The one negative thing I have to say about the pokedex/arceus mechanic is that is stupid to lock Arceus behind some mechanics that are almost impossible to find on your own. I killed the Overkqwil the game gives, so that's on me, but I would never find that you need to use the same mechanic 20x times. The same goes do Wyrdeer -- I'm not sure if you cand find it on the wild.

But Ursaluna is the worst one. I tried every item, so by discarding the ones you use on other pokemon, I imagined you needed the peat block. But, for me, is insane you need to evolve during a full moon, which is quite rare. It's insane because 99% of players will need to check guides for it, which is bad. It's also impossible to find Manaphy if you don't have Diamond and Pearl, which I don't, but as it is not necessary to get to Arceus, it's ok.

The Spiritomb mechanic, for me, it's ok. There is not a particular impossible wisp to find and, while doing the other stuff, I managed to find 93 out of 108. As I had done everything else and was clocking 70 hours, I decided to check a guide to get to Arceus. But, if you dedicate time to seach for them while doing other stuff, as I said, it's not bad.

The research mechanic is good. While it gets boring by the end, the game makes you cycle your team and train almost every pokemon, which is a first for me in the franchise (usually plan my team ahead and use 6 to 9 max). And you can get to a 10 research level really fast with almost all of them. The few you don't, it's actually a nice challenge, because they are rarer pokemon and you need to make the most of every encounter you have.

I'm not going through the mass outbreaks and distortions, but they are a nice change of pace and are very helpful to completing your dex.

The bosses are major win. Simply battling a high level pokemon it's ok -- the Alpha mechanic makes some battles really tough --, but introducing a different approach made the game really fresh for me, and the battles were really tough and satisfying after I managed to get through. Palkia was a great boss battle and the one traditional trainer vs trainer you get in the end game was really nice. I understand that some people may wanted more trainer battles, but It didn't seem necessary for me.

But, the best new thing is, easily, the riding mechanic. Switching Wyrdeer, basculegion and braviary is great. It's a very smooth experience and may very well be the best movement mechanic in video game history, not exaggerating. Being that good, the game never feels empty (I played almost all the praised triple A open world games and, even though there is much more on the screen, they usually have more boring parts). You never need to spend more than 10 seconds to get from pokemon A to B, which is great.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Epiclegend73,24-02-2022,"The most fun Pokémon game I played in years!! The new gameplay of mix of stealth and combat is very polished. Progression in game is lock behind what your star rank is so it's given you motivation to catch and do Pokedex research in the game. Pokedex research is simple and easy to do come done to how many Pokémon you catch to how many you have beaten in battle or what type of moves you us to beat a Pokémon. The biggest complaint I have is the Game Engine they used (think it the same one Game Freak used for Sword and Sheild) with textures pop in slow and the pop in before Pokémon do which can get annoying. Texture with glitch out in battles and wild Pokémon will randomly clip thought rock and tress making them uncatchable, and graphic aren't good at all but its Game Freak they never work on that.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

MrGabumon,21-02-2022,"as of writing this i have put over 50 hours into this game, finishing the main story, catching tons of pokemon and doing as many side quests i can and i must say i've nit been addicted to a game like this since i first played spider-man for the ps4. Legends arcues is in fact the definitive pokemon experience. As of recent the pokemon franchise has become very stale in it's games with so many half baked games, removal of fan favourite mechanics and some barely decent graphics. Arcues, while not the craziest game graphically legends is gonna save pokemon from further mediocrity. story is fun and quite interesting, while not mind blowing it will have genuine moments of surprise, excitement, sadness and fun. while some characters are quite stale the ones of any importance feel very genuine. game play is spectacular. this is the game (gamepley wise) is what we've wanted pokemon to become since we all played our first games. catching pokemon in the wild is extremely rewarding. Battles are fun with agile style and string style being a fun integration and something i wish would become apart of the mainline series as i found it to genuinely change up the fights, with getting more chances to attack after another exhilarating and your opponent attacking multiple times is while enraging you know most time it's something you could have avoided with the right tactics. The graphics are pretty good. All round the world is fun and nice however a clash of artistic stylisation and over all world building causes things to become flat and lesser than intended. the glitches too, while i've only experienced one i fell that mentioning of glitches is needed in this review as some have reported man glitches being a common occurrence for them and so all who read this should be cautious of such. Legends arceus is the direction pokemon is heading. While it isn't the main series of games, im hopeful that aspects of this game go into the main games and i'm excited to see more regions in the past, my most anticipated being a legends game set in Kalos, Galar and Unova would be the most incredible ones to play in my opinion. if you want this game, get it. if you ever want to get into pokemon or come back to it.

royalguy07,03-03-2022,"I played exclusively in handheld modeand this was my first pokemon game in over a decade.

Lets get the crap out of the way that doesn't distract that much from the overall feel and fun of playing the game. It looks like complete **** top to bottom, poor textures/everything, it is unfortunate because it is 2022 now and there have been good looking games on the Switch. The lack of dialogue is tough, characters are pretty hollow, dynamics between the NPCs are muted, some more work could of been done here. Now to the good, the games fluid open world mechanics, battling, gathering, collecting, and mounting all seamlessly flow within each other. It is a lot of fun once you get the hang of the controls, you can basically play like a maniac throwing pokeballs to collect, switching to throwing pokemon to collect, all while switching between your various mounts instantly. The game does gate you a little as you progress, requiring you to level up to progress through the story and soft gate you by making you level up or acquire a new team of Pokémon for a challenging story battle you can't beat. The ""boss"" battles become repetitive as they are similar in their mechanics and how you beat them, just dodge and throw the food at them, they are very hard to lose. It is a little annoying that it is not a ""true"" open world game but instead has separate large zones that you move in and out of through loading screens.

Initially, I'd give it 7/10, but the more I played it the more I liked this - there's plenty of content in this one, and they're adding new quests in updates.

Ghost_1,08-03-2022,"Pokemon Legends: Arceus is one of the best video games ever made and the best video game of 2022. Pokemon Legends: Arceus is best Pokemon game ever made until now. The game has open world gameplay, interaction with Pokemon in the overworld, new gameplay mechanics like stealth catching Pokemon and everything else new and innovative that it added to the Pokemon game series. Everything in the game is excellent including the story, the gameplay, the setting, the music and everything else in the game. The graphics in the game are acceptable because the game is exclusively on the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch has technical limitations and graphics limitations. The Nintendo Switch is not a high-end gaming PC with high-end graphics card, so obviously the graphics would not be the absolute best that they can be in 2022. Overall, Pokemon Legends: Arceus is the best Pokemon game ever made and really is one of the best games ever made because Pokemon games are some of the most best selling and most played video games of all time and Pokemon games have impact on the entire video game industry. Pokemon games are the core of the entire video game industry because of the Pokemon game series' popularity, sales and recognition in the video game industry. Pokemon Legends: Arceus is the best Pokemon game ever made as of now, and it has upgraded itself better than ever as the upgraded core of the entire video game industry.

Then Arceus came out and I decided to give it a try. I am usually not a big fan of open world game, I don't enjoy Breath of Wild because I often don't know what to do in the game, but Arceus is a different game. The half open world game style gives you a main story and also lots of quests to complete. I don't feel lost in the game.

Madbert,09-07-2022,"Jan 28, 2022

Evidentemente estamos ante el mejor juego de Pokemon que se haya desarrollado nunca, es súper entretenido y a nivel gráfico hay partes que se prestan a foto. Comprendo que haya gente que esperase más del apartado técnico sabiendo que la consola puede y este Pokemon está lejos de alcanzar el potencial que podían hacer. Dicho esto no voy a valorar los gráficos, Sencillamente es el pokemon con mejores gráficos. Loq ue si voy a valorar es el repetitivismo de la saga, no puede ser a estas alturas que todos y cada uno de los Pokemon hagan exactamente lo mismo sin apenas ninguna variación. Sabemos que se trata de cazar Pokemon pero coño que el 95% del juego se hacer eso una y otra vez y que para colmo al llegar al final del juego, el boss o bosses finales te obliguen a subir otros 20 niveles de golpe para poder vencer al juego es totalmente ridículo (y frustrante por cierto) Le doy un 8 porque no estoy valorando los gráficos, la próxima entrega si lo haré porque ya ha habido un precedente.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
DolphinReviews,19-07-2022,"I have been waiting for this game since Pokémon: The First Movie. Pokémon Legends: Arceus breaks the stagnant mold Pokémon games have been following since Red and Blue. The new catching mechanic and open word is something I have been craving forever. The new Pokémon are mostly great additions. However, the graphics leave a lot to be desired. There is also a lot of stiff character animations and the story is bare bones. The core gameplay is exactly the direction I hope Pokémon continues. The new boss battles are also a welcome addition, as well as, the large amount of side quests the game has to offer. Shining hunting is also easily the most fun it has ever been. If you are a Pokémon fan this is definitely a must buy.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC
levipon,05-08-2022,It's something different than usual. As a long-term pokémon can I really liked the new open-world setting and the idea of going back to the roots of catching and research. Being a complete opposite of the others game in the franchise has its ups and downs. I certainly missed the gym battles even tho I also kinda hated them in previous titles. Nonetheless they gave some feelings of success. The idea with the rank system is a decent replacement. I'd love a pokémon game with the traditional setting that's open like this game. For me that'd be a perfect combination.,8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

AngryNoivern,11-10-2022,"the only problems I have are the graphics can be a bit spotty here and there and at distance pop in and frame rate issues on wild Pokémon and the lack of voice acting which at this point in the whole franchise is long overdue.

exploring and catching are incredible, the battles feel a lot nicer than they have in the past (although it would be nice to use more than one in multi battles), and the fact that wild Pokémon can and do go after you while exploring adds just that bit more excitement to this cake.

and great news to shiny hunters its definitely more fun and easy to catch a shiny Pokémon with how the pokedex works in this game. once you catch a new Pokémon you need to fill out the whole entry to unlock all it info and if you get to level 10 research it bosts the shiny odds of that Pokémon.

BloodShadow,27-10-2022,"Its very refreshing to see a new direction to the franchise, i love the open zone and the catching mechanic. The concept of every character being an ancestor to characters from other games was a cool touch and allowed for cool easter eggs. Love the side missions, some of them being very interesting, and the fact that you can leave pokemon on the base that are then standing there makes it fell like your base is very unique to your pokemon likings.
The fighting mechanic was also a great change, which made it very fun and suprisingly challenging sometimes, the levels of the pokemon dont matter as much as previous games, where pokemon 30 level below you can easily one-shot you.
My biggest gripe whit the game is the fact that both shaymin and darkray are locked behind buying sword or shield and diamond or pearl remake respectivly, which makes it so you cant actually get arceus (the pokemon whos name is on the title )unless you buy both those games or play pokemon go until they show up.
Finally the Volo fight was one of the most awesome boss fights i ever played, from the new version of Cinthyas theme, to the Cinthyas pokemon team, the giratina fight and origin form, and 6v8 concept, all of it was amazing.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Tubey,14-02-2022,"I'm really conflicted on this game. It has a lot of negatives to it - missing Pokémon held back for DLC, meaningless characters, dull story, absolutely abysmal graphics when docked and played on a TV. These are all issues that'd kill on the spot 99% of games, and yet... I absolutely love Pokémon Legends: Arceus. I'm just unsure as to whether it's for objective reasons, or extremely subjective ones.

So yes, while all the above negatives are true, the gameplay loop of real time catching of Pokémon a la the 'Let's Go' series, combined with battling and a moderately increased difficulty level, improving on elements introduced in Sword and Shield, makes the actual moment to moment experience extremely satisfying. As a Pokémon fan, this is what I've been waiting for since I first played Blue in the 90s. But that's where the subjectivity comes in, because I think I'd be much more critical if I'd never heard of Pokémon and went into this game 'fresh'.

Game Freak deserve praise for taking chances and moving the franchise in an exciting new direction, but it really needs to be stressed just how bad this game actually looks. I'm all for gameplay over visuals, but there's a line in the sand where it just comes across as downright lazy from the developers. There's no excuse for the terrible textures that would make a Gamecube title blush - one particular scene at a volcano is almost vomit inducing in how choppy the textures are. This isn't an indie studio; this is a multi-million dollar franchise that can and should be doing better, even with the Switch's hardware taken into consideration.

Other aspects of the game, such as the invincibility frame 'dodge and roll', Dark Souls Lite boss battles and the tacked on crafting system, there simply to give more purpose to the 'open world' (inverted commas much needed here, as it's not really an open world as such) are so-so - not offensively bad or fantastically brilliant - and represent an opportunity to move the series forward more in the future. I missed the gym battle system as well to be honest, and hope that makes a return in future games.

Flaws aside, this is the best/freshest Pokémon title since probably Platinum, 14 years ago. It can be markedly improved (honestly, I don't remember the name of a single character and I finished playing half an hour ago; truly awful) but the strength of its' gameplay loop is enough to give it a hearty recommendation and definitely enough to get me excited about future games in the franchise.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

And I'm so happy to say, it really delivered. Having sunk 50 hours into the game so far, I am still enjoying it and for the first time since Pokémon Red I actually want to 'Catch em all'.

iMustang,16-02-2022,"Pokemon Legends Arceus is without a doubt the boldest and most ambitious entry in the history of the franchise. Setting out in the beautiful region of Hisui, this game caputres the same ""open air"" feeling Nintendo was able to achieve with Breath of the Wild. With an emphasis on capturing as opposed to battling, this game takes all of the best concepts of Let's Go and combined them with their core franchise to create a truly unique experience all it's own. The best element of this bold new venture is it's absolutely fantastic story. While a bit text heavy at times, this is the first Pokemon game Gamefreak has made since Black/White with a strong focus on story and they without a doubt knocked it out of the park with strong characters and emotional moments that moved me unlike any Pokemon game ever had before. In addition to a great story with fantastic characters, the game is absolutely beautiful and stunning to explore. Sure the Switch can only push graphics so far and some of the renders are far from perfect, but in the early hours of playing I found myself amazed and constantly thinking ""I can't believe this is a Pokemon game."" The gameplay loop is insanely addictive too; explore, capture, explore more, capture again, and before you know it you've lost hours of your life having a blast. With charming environments, soothing music, addictive gameplay, and the exciting feeling of encountering a new Pokemon it's very difficult not to find yourself smiling every time you play.

I could go on about the specific joys of this game like the thrilling boss battles, cutscenes, increased shiny encounters, crafting, the thrill of the hunt, wonderful new Hisuian forms and so much more, but I'll keep it as brief as possible. This game feels like both the true return to Diamond/Pearl as well as the next big Pokemon game we've all been waiting for. I have no doubt this will serve as the foundation for a whole Legends sub-series and when I think about this only being the beginning, I tremble with excitement to think of what can come next. Voice acting? 4K? I dare to dream, but for now I go back to the wonderful addiction that is Pokemon Legends Arecus. It's not perfect, but it's a beautiful start.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

They were a rushed product devoid of any meaningful content to the point were it felt downright cynical. It continued to be a massive commercial success. To me, it was the point were I gave up any hope of ever having another good pokemon experience. What I didn't expect was that Game Freak would then do a complete 180 and deliver... this! A game, definitely flawed, but that you can tell they were really passionate about! Do the graphics suck? Big time. But what this game does provide is a highly addicting feedback loop, immersive ways to catch and interact with pokemon, an interactable overworld, crafting, epic optional boss battles, ability based progression, a well contextualized side quest system, a worthwhile story etc. If this is the future of the franchise, then my gosh, my prayers have been heard, pokemon is saved, and I couldn't be happier!

ElSmasher,26-11-2022,"Pokemon Legends Arceus wants to focus the license on the open world. Bold for a franchise that has remained on its feet for decades. If the game has gameplay that is fun and inventive for the ""open world"" (in quotes). LPA suffers here from a catastrophic technique with poor graphics and textures of PS2. The level design is also weak, due to the low number of trainers and empty environments most of the time.

Ofrece una experiencia Pokémon diferente al resto.
Por primera vez completar la Pokédex es divertido, aunque requiere muchas horas de cumplir tareas innecesarias estúpidas con cada uno de los Pokémons.
Poder completar el juego sin necesidad de depender de intercambios con otra persona: puramente singleplayer.
A veces supone un reto a nivel de dificultad que pocas veces se suele ver en la franquicia.

La historia es absolutamente banal y aburrida.
Las batallas con los jefes no son satisfactorias y suponen baches en la experiencia.
Secundarias de recadero sin ningún tipo de interés.
Conversaciones y personajes clásicos de la saga: te tratan como si tuvieras 5 años y fueras imbécil.
Técnicamente es un despropósito, una vergüenza para las capacadidades de Switch. Debe ser el AAA más feo de la historia. Gráficos que dan asco, con un popping a apenas unos metros del personaje, expresiones faciales inamovibles, sin doblaje... Es un juego de hace 15 años.

Black_Mullet,03-01-2023,"Negatives:
1. Generally bad graphics for a 2022 game, especially the water texture.
2. Only 1 city and load screens and talking to ppl to get in and out of areas instead of open world
3. No online battling
4. No breeding, no abilities, no held items
5. Trainer battles were rare, somewhere around 20-30 I think.
6. Non existent post game.
7. Battling at training grounds is underwhelming and why am I fighting 1 vs 3?
8. New combat system is 1 step forward 2 steps backwards, and we don't even know exactly how it works. I was able to attack at least 9 TIMES in a row with Staraptor and Quick Attack against a slower opponent at my own level.
9. Not many Pokemon, no national dex.
10. Your Pokemon don't follow you, that's a big disappointment.
11. You can feed any other Pokemon except your own lol.
12. The Effort Levels mechanics, plain and unintuitive.
13. A bit too many cutscenes, although no voice acting. At least cutscenes don't look disgusting. (cough cough SW/SH)
14. No minimap.
15. Button layout is straight up bad, 100+ hours on and every time I need to get used to them.
16. In Noble fights game turned into Dark Souls for no reason.
Positives:
The most innovative game in the series so far, is also the best Pokemon game ever in terms of mechanics and sheer gameplay. It's an action RPG Pokemon game, you can throw stuff, get hit, ROLL!!, straight up catch anything you want by throwing pokeballs. Way better gameplay than S/V, the fluidity is just incomparable. Pokemon look amazing when you take them out of their balls, I'd like them to follow you around , interact with items you throw or automatically get into fights etc, but still, they really look awesome just standing there when you take them out (and you can actually take great pics unlike SV where they are constantly moving). UI looks clean moreso than SV, the story is great, the side quests are cool, new forms are dope too, alphas as well, they nailed them. Shiny hunting is the best and easiest it's ever been. Overall a very intuitive approach to Pokemon games

This game could be 9/10 if it was fully open world and had a tad better graphics, and a 10/10 had they included the things I mentioned, which I don't think it's too difficult to do for the next Legends title. I want Legends to be the new mainline and get all the mechanics it's missing. Buy this game people, it really is different in an awesome way.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

ND-Bringer,16-02-2022,"This game takes players on an extraordinary adventure in an ancient, Japanese themed world of Pokemon! Where you get the chance to befriend the legendary Pokemon Arceus! Let's hope everyone forgot about Pokemon Conquest so we can make that sound more original. OK, to be fair...I don't hate this game. I think this a great reimagining of Sinnoh. Its not the remake I wanted, but I still had a pretty good time. I was hesitate at first, discovering that the final Sinnoh remake was going to be a spin-off game really disappointed. I mean in Let's Go, the catching mechanics are vastly different compared to other games but they were easy to learn and its a lot like the original Pokemon games where everyone could learn ""Reflect"". But this a whole new Pokemon world...brand new catching mechanics and an altered battle system. It's all diverse. And while the battle system is OK at best, I'm really impressed with the new catching mechanics. Stalking careless Pokemon in the tall grass like a true hunter and then smashing them in the back for the capture...its really satisfying! It's definitely the game's biggest strength. This game definitely isn't for battle fans, but it was rather designed for those who love to complete the Pokedex. It's a world with no version exclusives and trade items are equivalent evolution stones. Nothing's holding you back this time to catch all of those pocket monsters. Personally my favorite part of this experience was probably the Alpha Pokemon. They remind me of some old PokePark memories. Only these Pokemon aren't pissed off, they want to tear you to shreds! It's so exhilarating trying to catch these guys. They roar so loud that its sends your character flying. The added size and the glowing red eyes really adds to intimidation. It looks a lot like the classic Mystery Dungeon box art. It's just gives me another reason to love them. They are over-leveled and are as strong as most legendaries, which makes it all the more satisfying to build a team out of them. Do you know how awesome it is to build a team made of Alpha Sinnoh starters, it's like a dream come true. And I'll also shout out, the reason I call this is a ""reimagined Sinnoh"" is because if you listen carefully...you can hear remixed level themes from Diamond and Pearl all across the game. Eterna Forest, Mt. Coronet, the works! The Celestica Flutes sound just like the old title screens. And there's plenty of Sinnoh Pokemon to set a nice, familiar tone to the game. I like the new Pokemon forms fine, but it puts a greater smile on my face to see hundreds of Sinnoh Pokemon spread across the land, INCLUDING the Platinum entries. Yes, move over half-asked Diamond and Pearl remakes...THIS is how its done! Well...for the most part the game is great. Even with my half broken controller and a few sprite glitches I was still having a fun ride, but the charm of the characters started to wear off after I defeated Avalugg. I bet a lot of people question this part when they back at the game. Why the hell does Commander Kamado kick you out of the village? For some reason, he suddenly accuses you, the child suffering from amnesia, who has been doing nothing but help Team Galaxy, and save the Nobles...for causing the distortion threatening the region of Hisui. At this point of the game a lot a scene in the story feel forced. The Commander suddenly turns into an antagonist and there's some extra backstory for the Charm Sisters. And I just don't care. Some of the boss fights in this game were annoying and I'm not a fan of all the side quests...but those are just nitpicks. An RPG game doesn't need a breathtaking story to be good, but Kamado's motivation is childish. It feels like the writers just made his character an antagonist because the first climax wasn't exciting enough. This is just as weak as Sword and Shield's antagonist. And as for Volo as the true villain, I have to ask...did anyone care? The final fight takes place after the main story credits, so most players are likely to miss out on it. Its not really built up well and sadly, like the new Cynthia in the remakes, the developers make this fight unnecessarily difficult in order to entertain older fans. I like difficult Pokemon challenges, but do you really think the battle system was a highlight in this game? The game starts to feel smaller when I started to climb Mount Coronet. Not putting the effort to remake the Distortion World, or summit level longer was a huge missed opportunity. I can't listen to the sweet remix if the level one takes a minute to climb! The main gimmicks are a lot more entertaining than the conclusions. The characters are vibrant an dit feels good to build a team of my favorite Pokemon. But this game really needs something more if it wants to be remembered. Hopefully, the DLC this time around will be worth purchasing. Because this is the most fun I've had with a modern Pokemon game in years. I hope that Gamefreak will return to greatness someday. One step at a time.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Santi2277,22-11-2022,"The renewal of Pokémon has been made as it needed, in a 3D movement world. It has expected things and some new unique mechanics such as launching the ball, mobility in the combat as a trainer, and many more. It also combines perfectly the action game with the turns games. The graphics are nice for nintendo switch and fit the game. The main history could have been longer (one or two ""señorial"" more). It copies lots of things of Dragon Quest Monters Joker 3 which was only released in Japan and advanced Pokémon (still one DQ monsters in development though).

FlexosuarousRex,03-03-2022,"I was very skeptical about legends arceus leading up to its launch. I was nervous that the new formula would be innovative and unique but would ultimately leave a lot to be desired. I was actually pleasantly surprised with what gamefreak delivered. This is the first pokemon game created in a style that is vastly different from previous titles and maintained the pokemon ""feel"" while making sweeping changes to the overall gameplay loop.

Pros: Very fresh take on the formula, more action based gameplay, sacrifices very little in terms of staple game mechanics, good pokedex selection, a catching mechanic that stokes envy from the lets go games, varying and noticeable size differences in the pokemon that makes each catch that much more unique, a serviceable plot, much more streamlined ""Competitive"" building of pokemon that only requires a pokemon to be fed certain items, decent post game content, being able to summon all your pokemon at once in order to chill/ interact with them, interesting options for traversal, new pokemon forms to play with, decent in-game economy encourages catching pokemon and collecting items, and enraged pokemon are huge and fun to capture.

Cons: Not having multiplayer is a shame given how fun the single player content is, the levels are large but there's not a whole lot to see in them, the appeal of the ""open world"" wears off towards the end of the game when all traversal mechanics are unlocked, the graphics aren't that great, not enough trainer battles, in my opinion the new pokemon forms are pretty ugly design-wise (decidueye) except for a few (arcanine, typhlosion), and, again in my opinion, the boss pokemon minigame could have been much more fleshed out - it just wasn't that interesting and felt a bit tacked on to me but I feel it is a step in the right direction.

I had loads of fun playing arceus and was genuinely thankful that gamefreak not only shook up the formula immensely but managed to get so many things right on the first try. None of the cons I listed above stopped me from enjoying the game from start to finish. Its far from a perfect experience, but it is an experience that gets me very excited for future ""legends"" titles.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The battle system has had a noticeable change with how you can move the camera around and actually move around yourself which is a nice refresh on how battles work.

The story is alright enough but don't expect anything groundbreaking to keep you on your toes.

Gameplay is really where it's at here as you spend a lot of your time roaming around catching Pokémon and filling out your Pokédex. The catching in this game is so good as your able to throw pokeballs at Pokémon without going into battle.

Music is great as always with Pokémon games.

wnedgar,15-09-2022,"2022 is going insane, I can't believe I'm actually saying good things about a GameFreak game.
This game is highly recommended to everyone who loves Pokémon - from die-hard fans of the franchise/games, to casual gamers/Pokémon fans. It covers really well both sides of the spectrum.

This is the best Pokémon game I've played since Black/White, and it's on my top 3 ever from this franchise. On the positive side (which I have a lot to say, but I'll keep it short), I'd like to mention the super fast load times of each area, the attention to detail when it comes to Pokémon animation on the world-map, and also the animation on battles. The quick battles and QOL improvements it has over the main games is freaking awesome - i can't see myself going back to a traditional Pokémon game ever again. The battle system is also awesome!

Now, let's talk about the bad things - not to say the game is bad, but we desperately need improvements: WE NEED VOICES! I was so frustrated at some point about the story that I would just smash my A button non-stop to stop the super-duper-boring-long dialogues that would never end, without any voice acting or sounds on the background. It's just so lacking and annoying at some point, you start to HATE every interruption to tell you the story of the game. I just wanted to play for the game-play, because this part of the game was so boring after 20h of playtime. That said, I'd expect a better storyline on the upcoming games, being based on this same game-play system. It has just so much potential, we shouldn't just expect the foolish ""I'm a kid alone and will find the legendary/confront Rocket teams out there for no reason"" plot.

klambert,12-06-2022,"This game had the potential to be so great. Alpha pokemon, the catching system for land-based pokemon, cyndaquil do be quillin'.

Unfortunately, that's about where the good stops.

The game looks absolutely terrible for an open world game.

Damage is whack.
Wild pokemon 40 levels below your alpha pokemon will wipe it in 2 1x effective hits.
A wild alpha will wipe your entire party, 20 levels above it, with one move.

The maps load/render distance is terrible. They know the hardware of the system they made, do they not?

Catching pokemon in water is hot garbage.

Forced exp share is an ass idea that gives waaaaay too much xp, and yet, somehow, you're still *constantly* leveling random pokemon that nobody wants to use for no apparent reason to fill the pokedex information of pokemon you've already caught.

The story is kind of meh, even for pokemon games.

The ""boss fights"" are bad in every aspect, either being absurdly easy or zoning you in a corner for 2 straight minutes for literally no reason.
All of this, and the game is still about a 7.9.

So let's talk about the **** satchel.

For absolutely no reason whatsoever, GameFreak limits your base inventory capacity to about 1/4 of the amount of berries in the game. The only way to get more is from satchel merchant, the single stupidest idea in the history of gaming. By the time you're spending 40k$ on a single inventory space expansion, you still can't hold every berry in the game. This continues, slowly increasing every purchase, up to a million. Why a million? Who knows. Will you ever have a million? No, likely not. Will satchel merchant ever have a million? Oh yes, he'll take it from you so you can hold more berries. Then, you lose items on fainting, and you can faint to a stream out of combat, for no reason other than shoehorning NSO where it doesn't belong.

Now we're at a 2.5

They also limit your starting pokemon storage space, despite insisting you catch every pokemon 17 times, though this does eventually start to expand on its own.

Derpcat,24-09-2022,"When this Pokémon presents happened, everyone thought the remakes would be the thing to talk about. And this happened.

Open world Pokémon. How about that? If you don’t know what that means, then it means the world is much more open and explorable. It feels much more immersive and personalized. This is much better than the old Pokémon formula. Not to say that the old formula is bad, but it’s leagues behind the new one. The game also looks gorgeous in a hand-drawn sort of way. The music is quite good, and reminds me of Diamond & Pearl.

The story is that you are teleported by some diety to when Sinnoh, or Hisui as it was called, and stop the powered-up Pokémon terrorizing the region, whilst filling up that Pokédex. I won’t go into further detail, but the story is quite intricate.

There is more content then Mario Odyssey. There are tons of side quests and a post game. This is hours and if you want the true ending, you need all the Pokémon.

This game is what the new Pokémon formula is. I’m excited for Scarlet and Violet already.",10,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Super_Oshawott,17-11-2022,"Recent Pokémon games have NOT been the best as of late. Since X and Y's release, the series has started to be very decisive between gamers. While i think that Pokémon Legends: Arceus is not perfect with its visual style, it is very much my new favorite Pokémon game.

I suck at RPG's, with one of the only Pokémon games I have ever beaten was base Sword and Shield (And we know how everyone feels about that game). However, Legends' gameplay loop was very simple to pick up and play and the story, as basic as it was, kept me engaged the entire way through. Top it off with some of the series best starters returning to be your starting pokemon in this game (Who were also my three favorite starters of all time, so I'm a bit biased here), and the game is fun enough to get a recommendation for anyone that has a switch.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Pros:
-Fun Departure from the repeated gameplay of the other games in the series
-Overworld Catching is fast and fun
-All the ride Pokemon are fast and fun to use
-The new Pokemon are mostly pretty cool
-The battle/idle/overworld animations are a clear improvements
-The Ability to fill up the Pokedex alone without needing to trade with friends

Cons:
-Graphics Look Underwhelming(Not Really Bad Just Kinda Disappointing)
-I wish there were more new Pokemon
-The Story is Boring and The Long Dialogue Segments Don't Help It
-Catching Anything that Swims Or Teleports Is a Pain

Other Notes:
Alot of these things should've been added around BDSP or SWSH
I still am waiting for real time battles where we can control and fight as the Pokemon

I love the concept of Pokemon. But the games always felt a bit too restrictive with how you could move & how you would get pokemon! The whole sneaking up on Pokémon is interesting! And then being wary/aggressive to humans - makes sense to me! I love being able to explore this much!
The graphics could have been a bit better, but honestly? They didn't bother me.
I'm currently almost finished with my Pokédex and research - but, even though I've already had so much fun with the game - i'm not worried about losing interest. Because the reward for completing the Pokédex & research - the shiny charm will only make me more eager to play & hunt down some shines (even though the game has already been quite generous with them even without it!).

Are they fun? Yes
Does it include platinum content? No
Are the graphics bad? No
Would you replay them again? In a heartbeat

BDSP is, without a shadow of a doubt, a trip down nostalgia lane, a re-imagining of the original journeys throughout the Sinnoh Region from their initial outings in Diamond & Pearl. Story If the goal was to achieve faithful remakes of those games, then ILCA have fully succeeded in their mission. It’s just as leisurely paced as the original Diamond & Pearl, encouraging the player to take their time and take in their surroundings. The story of DP is quite grand but it wasn’t fully realised and developed until Platinum. Lots to do & explore whilst not feeling too linear with a maze-like map. In this instance however, after playing through the game, I personally feel as though the fleshed out story beats from Platinum are missing here.

Graphics
They’re clean, charming & capture the essence of what classic top-down Pokémon used to be. Cutesy & child-like. Sword & Shiled in comparison can look a little muddy around the edges. There were a few janky animations from time-to-time but nothing that didn’t just make me smile and giggle. They clearly take inspiration from the Links Awakening remake, and on reflection, it was probably the better route to go down than trying to re-create these games in Sw/Sh graphics. Don’t be fooled by the initial reveal trailer, the improvements in lighting, shading & character models has come on leaps & bounds since we first saw it at the beginning of the year. Everything Else
-The roster of Pokémon is as it was in Gen 4, it actually makes for a decent challenge trying to shape a team with the Pokémon you have at your disposal. We won’t get all the Pokémon in Legebds Arceus, we didn’t get them all in Sw/Sh, why should this be any different?
-The grand underground is a place where you could spend hours hunting through the walls or capturing Pokémon, otherwise unobtainable in the overworld for your adventure. ILCA, you did a cracking job of the underground and making it useful & accessible for everyone. -Contests have been re-defined & streamlined but IMO I would say this was for the worst. Contests in the original had substance & felt like a journey in of themselves. The new version of contests are a rhythm game - great if you’re short of time, but I didn’t feel as though I had something to work towards. Poffin making can be tedious at times! - The EXP share was a necessary edition although it should have been a toggleable option. I had it on for my whole journey and blacked out a couple of times! It negates the grind, but ideally should’ve been optional. I very much enjoyed my time with BDSP, ILCA have managed to rekindle that inner child and bring back memories of playing my original copy of Diamond back in 2007. Newcomers of the series will have a shock as BDSP is the genuine article when it comes to what Classic Pokémon is all about. A little bit tough, a grand adventure & a lot of fun. Highly recommend first time Pokémon players pick up this one rather than any of the more recent entries. ILCA catered this game to the fans of Diamond & Pearl, a love letter to what Pokémon used to be, trying not to get hung up on the more recent additions & changes in the newer games. I hope TPC continue to outsource some of their projects.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

PrincessSaf,21-11-2021,"While I would have preferred a remake in the style of Sword and Shield, I am not entirely against the style they chose to be closer to the originals as they were on DS. However it just feel like they did the minimum to remake the originals and to me it does not compare with the third gen remakes.

In a way I don't think they are best for those who did not play the originals because those remakes feel worse than Sword and Shield and I don't think they are much better than playing the originals either, so I am mixed for the recommendation overall. Maybe if they were a third less expensive than main releases it would have been better.

I still can't give it a bad score, I can't 100% recommend it, but I like it, it looks good enough, and it's based on good games, so I would recommend people to look a little into it before buying but it should be fine.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

katieelizabeth,20-11-2021,"Pokemon BDSP are not bad games, but overall I'd say this is a pretty unambitious and mediocre remake of an average game for its time that is frankly too faithful for its own good.

In terms of graphics, the game looks completely outdated. The chibi art style is not endearing, nor does it look very good. Fortunately, the character models and pokemon look much better in battle, but all this does is make me wish they were used throughout the entire game. The in-battle models frankly look so much better than the chibi stuff.

The environments look bland and look worse than the original pixel graphics from 2006. I wish they didn't maintain the 2D tile aesthetic - it just looks fake/outdated to me. How do several indie games manage to look better than a game produced by a 105 billion dollar company?

While the soundtrack is an improvement over the original version on the DS, it still falls way short of the live orchestrated soundtrack from Sword and Shield. Unfortunately, it sounds like this soundtrack is entirely midi-based, lacking any real recorded instruments of any kind.

The story isn't all that interesting either. The original script came out around the same time as Mass Effect. The script wasn't good for its time, let alone holding up in 2021. It is a missed opportunity that the developers didn't modernize/reimagine the script to become more engaging and in line with modern RPGs or the very best of its anime. I wish the gym leaders were more fleshed out and part of the story. I wish team Galactic was given a lot more depth.

The pacing of BDSP is incredibly slow, and the game finds ways to waste your time repeatedly. Random battles are extremely outdated and are annoying, especially in caves. I am so disappointed the game did not choose to have pokemon in the overworld like the modern games.

Eggs take forever to hatch in BDSP and do not benefit from the increased hatching time found in Sword and Shield. I spent over 9000 steps to hatch the egg given to me in Hearthome City and it just wouldn't hatch for me. I got better things to do than rotate my L-stick riding a bike until it hatches. This is such an outdated game mechanic that did not need to be implemented ""faithfully"" in BDSP.

Battles are also super slow to the point of them becoming grating. Essentially, Pokemon battles aren't ""show don't tell"" - BDSP verbosely tells yous everything in nauseating detail. When I faint a pokemon, it should fall immediately when I hit it - it should be obvious to anyone what has happened to that Pokemon by just looking at the animation and the health bar going to 0. Instead, the game's faint animation happens many seconds after the hit, and BDSP still insists on telling you the pokemon fainted with an additional textbox too. Even FF7 did this properly on the Playstation 1! Why is everything so verbose with text dialog boxes for?

Before each combat round, BDSP also shows a textbox saying, ""Your pokemon is awaiting directions."" No kidding! Does anyone seriously need this textbox??? Stuff like ""It's Raining"" is also equally redundant - we can see it raining on the screen! And when using a move, there's no reason its name can't be displayed at the same time as the animation too. The amount of verbose and completely unnecessary text in this game is beyond ridiculous.

And when a battle starts, can we finally have an option to remove the Pokeball fanfare and just have all pokemon come out immediately to save time? Why does starting every random battle have to be padded with 10 seconds of animations? Can the Switch not load these battles faster?

Then there are weird control issues in BDSP, such as the L and R buttons not working in the menus like every other modern game, which tripped me up quite a bit. The d-pad is also unfortunately assigned to walking when it should have been assigned to your 4 registered items. Why did none of the QA staff say anything?

Ultimately, BDSP needed to completely reimagine modern Sinnoh in full 3D (similar to Sword and Shield), modernize and polish the script, and increase the quality of life and production values across the board to justify its AAA price tag. Barring that, BDSP needed to be sold for $29.99 given what we got. Essentially, BDSP is a low-budget cash grab and it should not be praised or endorsed in any way. Pokemon fans need to be vocal and reject these cash grabs. Pokemon fans need to demand better for their hard-earned money because BDSP is an embarrassment for a full AAA-priced game, and is simply not competitive with other AAA games on the market.

If you want to go back to the past - for all its problems - then you might enjoy BDSP. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy this game. BDSP's archaic and overly-verbose design just doesn't interest me anymore. I would have much rather had a modern reimagining of modern Sinnoh with immersive 3D environments, a modern engaging story, and high production values. Modern Sinnoh deserved better.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Zaregoto,20-11-2021,"I loved the original games when they first came out on the DS, and this doesn't do them justice at all.
Pitiful overworld art style, screwed up balance because of gen7 movesets and forced exp share, while at the same time providing almost no new content or any platinum content for that matter. They consciously decided against it too. Not just that, Gamefreak looked at gen 4 and was like ""this isn't worth our time"" and made some random mobile game company create the game for them. It looks like a joke in comparison to Alpha Saphire which released 7 years ago. Please do not support this. Show Gamefreak that you don't just gobble up anything they shove down your throat.

TheHonestMan,24-11-2021,"Mediocre experience. Retains the originals flaws and has an ugly art style for the sake of ""faithfulness"". Sinnoh itself is still well designed and the improved pacing is welcome but there's just nothing compelling about it for those looking for a better or fresh take on the originals. Forced exp share and affection bonuses also tamper with the experience as most of the game it not rebalanced to accomodate them. You'll get some causal nostalgic fun going through the story but the buyer's remorse will kick in at the postgame where there is little to do except the same old low-effort legend fetch quest we've had since ORAS. Save your money for Legends",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC
PewPewMcP,01-12-2021,"Remakes are supposed to take the best gameplay elements of the old games while brushing up on gameplay mechanics that didn't age well to deliver a fulfilling, up-to-date experience. However, Gamefreak once again demonstrates their utter inability to design decent videogames by selecting the least liked mechanics from old and new Pokemon games, stitching them together in to a misshaped chimeric mess and bold-facedly masquerading it as a ""faithful remake"". Concepts such as 8 directional run are carelessly implemented to create a glitchy, softlock prone game that really makes you feel like you're playing Gen 1 again, while the chibi style is horribly leveraged to create some of the ugliest cutscenes in the series. TMs somehow are one-use again, while the unpopular mandatory EXP share makes a comeback, illustrating Gamefreak's tone deafness and general inability to sift good mechanics from bad ones. The long-requested feature of Pokemon following you makes a return, but the Pokemon scale awkwardly, follow you clumsily (often ending up just warping to your position due to their slow follow speed) and mesh poorly with the aforementioned ugly chibi character sprites. Affection and friendliness are now collapsed into one mechanic in a classic hallmark of Gamefreak laziness, and much like the EXP share, reduce your options to control how you play the game. The Poketch has been forced in without any consideration for how well it works in docked mode. And of course, your national dex is still stuck in a reduced capacity while battle animations remain as lazy and uninspiring as ever.

If you are a child or parent of a child, this of course doesn't matter to you, you're still playing Pokemon because it's designed for kids. But if you consider yourself someone who enjoys well-implemented game mechanics, I advise you to turn away from this title. Gamefreak demonstrates yet again it has no idea what good game mechanics are and are instead throwing everything at the wall, not even caring whether anything sticks because they are in charge of the biggest videogame franchise in the world and they know it'll sell well no matter how little effort they actually put into it. As someone who has played every generation since Gen 1, I cannot in good faith recommend this Pokemon game.",4,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Exocation,01-12-2021,"The new style looks very ugly, but everyone can decide that for himself. The optics on the other hand are just bad, plain bad, just go to YouTube and look at a comparison between this game an Pokemon let's go, which was released 3 years ago! The are worlds between, this game just looks ugly. Plus, why on earth would you not include all the improvements the Platin edition already did?? PLUS they actively made the game worse, for example by adding a global exp share that you CANT disable. All in all, the game is very ugly and you can feel how lazy the devs/Nintendo was to release this poorly made cash grab. This game and the Pokemon series deserve so much better.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC
SavageReviews1,25-11-2021,My biggest gripe with this game and this series in general is I basically one shot ever trainer/ Gym Leader with my starter Pokémon. It makes battles boring which makes up a majority of the gameplay. I wish they would add some difficulty options. How about making it so you can only use certain types of Pokémon in a gym battle or make it so you can only carry three Pokémon at a time. Or how about have the trainers and gym battles match whatever level you are like the grand underground does? It shouldn’t be on the player to have to create artificial limits to make the game more challenging. My wife is even bored with the game after the third gym battle because she has all these Pokémon but she never has a reason to use them because her starter handles everything.,5,POKEMON,METACRITIC
ZoroGust,07-12-2021,"It's so lazy it looks like a remaster! Justified the dexit to enhance the ""graphics improvement"", but tell me what this remake has graphically to bring only the pokemon of the original game?",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC
ND-Bringer,02-12-2021,"Fans have been pleading for Diamond and Pearl remakes ever since generation 7. But what we got was something quite abysmal. Calling this the definitive way to experience the Sinnoh region is like giving a kid too much sugar before bed. I wasn't expecting this game to be ground breaking like Heart Gold and Soul Silver, but this game just made my nightmares come true. I have been a die-hard fan of Pokemon for as long as I can remember. I understand that Pokemon games may not be as amazing as the used to be, but at least there was some form of effort made to inspire the next generation of players. But this game has let me down HARD. This game has unbalanced difficulty spikes, brings back old problems, creates new problems, and has a handful of glitches. The main game had left me so mentally exhausted that I felt broken after the credits rolled. Many people praise how great the new challenges are, but they're all pointless if you ask me. For one thing, Unova, Kalos, Alola, and Galar are unavailable to obtain. It's nice that you to stick to a classic Pokemon selection theme, but you're not taking full advantage of it since only Pokemon from the original Sinnoh Pokedex are available. And the only way to obtain Pokemon from regions is by getting lucky with rare spawns or getting the National Dex in the post game allowing more Pokemon to appear in the Grand Underground. It feels unfair that I have build a team with these limited options. It's like how the monster Houndour is only available in the Kanto post game in the Johto region titles despite being a Johto Pokemon. One detail that makes Pokemon Platinum so great is that it's the first title to have Houndour available in the main game. Not only did the developers fixed the lack of fire type Pokemon in Sinnoh, but it made a lot of players smile. But nope! Someone thought it was a good idea to leave all the good stuff from Platinum out. So I can't build a decent team to fight the super version of Sinnoh's Elite Four. While they're a lot stronger thanks to their boosted EV stats, this is the only real challenge in the main game. Since everyone was a pushover I've been dead bored throughout most of the game. My rival somehow used a level 26 Starly, to win 4 gym badges!? I don't get it. I didn't have one drop of joy while facing the Pokemon League. I like a good challenge but this is a really high difficulty spike compared to the rest of the trainers I've fought. Their final teams in the post game are level 85, are equipped with good items, and have crazy high stats. Challenges like these are what Pokemon fans have been waiting for! But then why do they feel so empty? Look, we've fought Cynthia before in Sun and Moon. The difference there is that she uses Mega Evolution a new mechanic introduced in X and Y. X and Y was a generic game but the Mega Evolution mechanic it introduced has been fleshed over the years. Cynthia's final team is powerful, but since none of the new battle mechanics are available in this game, it has locked potential. The teams in this game are powerful, but it's nothing I haven't seen before. This whole game feels like a Pokemon mod, meaning anyone could have designed this game. Only tweaked mini games are introduced everything else just feels unoriginal. You have to go through hours of training, planning, and patience to be able to stand a chance against the difficulty spikes. And because the main game is so long and tedious your Pokemon skills will get worse before they get better. Even the main story feels lackluster, hell the original games did it better! The originals designs don't show the over world characters mouths, so you can imagine how they feel with the given dialogue and theme of the area. It's like how people us more imagination while reading. But thanks to the modern art style Pokemon characters can be more expressive. But even if I don't mind the Chibi art style it just looks wrong. Characters will rarely mouth animations making emotional scenes feel empty. And what's this? Ever since I got my coin toss app, my game will start to glitch out every time I turn on my Poketch! That's just PEACHY! There's not much enjoyment to be found because you have to wait to find it. Even the little things bother me immensely. The colors are slightly washed out, making the game even look unappealing. This game is a filthy reflection of the originals. Even if new content is added in to make the game better, the damage has been done. At least Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire introduced new abilities. At least Let's Go recreated the Kanto experience with elements of freedom. Hell, Pokemon X and Y at least didn't screw my progress with glitches and errors. If you want to experience the beauty of Sinnoh go play Pokemon Platinum. Generic Pokemon games usually just make my eyes roll, but I just hate this game. Now I know how Cyrus feels. This game was a waste of my time. I hope that Legends Arceus can save this franchise. All I feel now is rage.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC

judgementblade,16-02-2022,"I'll try to keep this short and on point. For starters, Gen 4, namely Platinum is my favorite Gen (Gen 6 being 2 and Gen 3 ironically 3). It is also one of the tougher games in the franchise, which still holds up compared to most other Pokemon main games. As such, I was rather looking forward to it. Unfortunately these remakes were not that good. I chose Shining Pearl since originally I played Diamond on DS.
Like for many, the Chibi-Style didn't resonate with me at first. After a couple of hours it didn't bother me anymore. Still, I really LOOOOOOOOVED the contest in Platinum and can't believe HOW MUCH they screwed them up in this re-make.I had hardly any fun with them anymore. It would have been fine if it just had been one round. Sadly, that **** they came up with here, is all that was left of the original really great Contests. New player though won't know what they botched here.
The new Underground wasn't that great either. I assumed stupidly that I would be able to catch new Pokes before the national Dex but no, so a rather pointless addition and also terrible to not be able to decorate my secret base with carpets, poster and other furniture like originally, only with rather useless statues until post-game. However, I love the new trainer animations when they lose, they are charming. This doesn't help how annoying the menu delay is though. Don't be surprised if your too fast for the game and use an item in a way you didn't intent due the delay screwing you over.
I never cared for competitive play and not even catching them all since Gen 5 so I won't go more in-depth than this. It was fine to play through it again but I rather play the originals, you even got a holiday estate in Platinum in post-game but not even that anymore. So, don't buy it for more than 20-30 bucks if at all, unless you just want a modern look on Gen 4 that you missed for one reason or another.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
ProfessorPlumb,30-11-2021,"In many ways I found myself disappointed playing Pokémon Shining Pearl. I don’t have a ton of nostalgia for this game as I grew up more heavily with Pokémon Gen 3 and Gen 5. At its core, Shining Pearl still has the addicting gameplay loop of catching Mons, challenging Gym Leaders, and foiling nefarious criminal plots on the side. There are some really cool Pokémon in Sinnoh that are fun to find and use. I like the honey tree mechanic, which I feel gives you a solid reason to go back and re-explore areas all over the map. The last few gyms felt much better-developed and even as an adult I had fun solving the puzzles to get to the Gym Leaders. The music has a fresh coat of orchestrated paint and several of the tracks stand out with the jazz and charm that makes Pokémon’s music so iconic and memorable. Sinnoh’s map isn’t my favorite, but some areas like Mount Coronet were fun to explore.

The HM mechanic is improved due to not having to spend valuable move slots on your party, but it feels awkward because if you use fly or surf, it’s a random starraptor or bibarel that perform the HM, it doesn’t make sense and breaks immersion. I think a sensible solution would be to use the HM’s only if a Pokémon on your current team is capable of using it. That way it feels special to have useful Pokémon on your team but you don’t have to bog your team down with an “HM Slave” or two. The TM mechanic feels like they struck the right balance, where they do break so you have to conserve TM, but the common ones can be found or purchased, and the gym leader TMs give you multiple copies so it’s not wasted entirely if you end up using it on a Pokémon and decide later not to use them. It’s unfortunate that the game is so ridiculously easy throughout, you can play through the entire game without losing a single battle. I had this complaint about Sword/Shield as well, so the best I can say is Pokémon is a relaxing gaming experience, and if you want true challenge, try playing competitive Pokémon or a different video game. The main story is just too easy. There feels like an infinite amount of trainers to battle on the various routes but none of them are particularly challenging or memorable, just more fresh meat to level up your Pokémon. It gets stale in the mid-late game.

The characters feel excessively clumsy and clunky, I found myself getting stuck often and the general movement felt terrible. The chibi animations are somewhat cute but the character wobble like fisher price toys, it is very unnatural. It is incredibly jarring to see team Galactic boss as a chibi model and then you battle him to see him as a rugged adult man that could kill you with his eyes, it makes no sense and I really disliked the juxtaposition of both models. The game feels SLOW. Battling is tedious, and since that is 60% of the gameplay, it gets old really quick. I found myself playing half-heartedly with one hand on the controller and watching YouTube or listening to music in between battles. I really wish they would make a Pokémon game that combines all of the magic of the core gameplay but make it more pretty polished, actually make the battles difficult (I thought the AI for the 8th gym leader was a step in the right direction, he felt noticeably more challenging than the other gyms), and make the battling 10x faster and more intelligent. They could keep the game as is for the main demographic of children but it would be as easy as creating a difficulty slider or “this is not my first rodeo” mode so that more experienced and older players can enjoy the nostalgia of Pokémon without being made to feel like they’re actually still 10 years old. Overall I had some fun, so I will still say it is playable, but definitely a slip in quality in my opinion from the ds/3ds Pokémon era.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
HeraticParadox,13-03-2022,"This remake tries to be a faithful adaptation of the original, but they somehow managed to make it worse with the few quality of life additions they chose to include. The worst offender is the always on XP share. It took what was one of of the closest Pokémon games to being a traditional RPG experience and turned it into a mindless slog through the antiquated design of the games unchanged original map. The change to the HM system was nice. I no longer needed to keep a Bidoof with me at all times in the overworld, but, for some reason, they decided to revert back to TMs breaking. The graphics, while trying to be a chibi reproduction of the original, somehow managed to be worse. The pixel art of the original, while probably a bit behind the times for the DS, was still elegant. I really thought the graphics of the Let’s Go games was going to be Nintendo’s low point for the series, but they proved me wrong. Even the movement feels bad. How they took a grid based top down game and made the movement feel bad is mind blowing to me. The controls feel imprecise and I was constantly colliding with environmental objects. The whole game just feels cheap, and yet it costs more than the original did. It just feels like they cut every corner possible to get the game out quickly. A good old fashioned cash grab. Thankfully the game was at least mostly bug free, but that’s really the only praise I can give it. I regret buying this game, but not nearly as much as I regret the 24hrs I spent beating it.",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

FriendlyDM2,22-11-2021,"I’ve enjoyed this game a lot!

Seeing Pokémon Diamond and Pearl in 3D like this was a lot of fun. At first, I didn’t enjoy the overworld style in the trailers all that much, but that feeling quickly faded away as I played the game. Small adjustments which have been made to the game to make some quality of life changes have been very welcome! The battle system is snappy and doesn’t waste any of your time!

The Grand Underground is a lot of fun, has been made a bit more simple in comparison to the originals on the Nintendo DS and have been expanded at the same time, now including wild Pokémon to catch and train against!

The inclusion of the Experience Share for every one of your party members shaves off a lot of time previously spent sending out your weakest Pokémon, switching to a stronger one and then finishing the battle, or being able to only train one Pokémon at a time with a single Experience Share Hold Item, which makes it a LOT easier to help evolve Pokémon for completing your Pokédex!

All in all, I’ve been having a lot of fun with this game, though I personally see this as more of a €40,00 title, rather than a full-price one. I would have wanted to see even MORE from this remake than what we got. I can recommend this game for sure though!",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

notnoxi,01-12-2021,"tl:dr Pokemon SP failed to give you a reason to play their remake instead of going back to your Nintendo DS. Every remake achieved this, but this time they failed to validate it. You aren't missing much.

Excited at it's first reveal, I was optimistic about the team behind it and how they were taking it. However as the months went by, reality comes knocking my door. Outside Legends of Arceus, this will be the only time you will get to explore sinnoh again for a long time. Besides the questionable gameplay changes and other issues, the remake does the acceptable job of releasing Sinnoh to the Switch. But it's underwhelming for one of the longest and anticipated remakes, in comparison to how Pokemon Company handled their previous remakes. Traditionally, a pokemon remake is done with current technology in mind of it's recreation to show how hardware progressed and what it would've looked like if it were made at that time instead. You saw this with HeartGold / SoulSilver and FireRed/LeafGreen. BDSP misses that mark by not taking advantage of it's hardware and did not add much new additions to this remake. The soundtrack wasn't done much justice, did not take full advantage of Platinum improvements, and the legendary park is cool to a degree till you realize you could already do this in many of their previous games. Platinum DLC is off the table too as you can unlock the alt form in the game, it's also hard to call this a faithful remake when there's things they've forgotten, failed to capture the same atmosphere or color palette, or just changed something for no good reason.

Desde la sexta generación eran simplemente malos, antes aún, tenían algunos problemas (rejugando blanco y negro, son peores de lo que recordaba). Pero desde que pokemon llegó a switch esto es un desproposito, se ríen el cara de la gente y se cagan en una obra que nació como un proyecto verdaderamente apasionado. Pokemon está muerto, y Gamefreak no lo va a resucitar. Hay dos opciones: O Gamefreak, por dignidad, asume su incomptencia y deja la franquicia en manos de buenos diseñadores, o simplemente asuman los seguidores de estos juegos que Sol y Luna fueron los últimos juegos de Pokémon en los que, aunque fuesen mediocres, aún había una pizca de ambición (atrozmente llevada a cabo). Lo que quiero decir es que, aunque Sol y Luna, X e Y u ORAS no merezcan el tiempo de los jugadores y jugadoras, al menos había aún un mínimo esfuerzo por crear algo nuevo con esos juegos, que repetía la fórmula, sí, pero con matices. Ahora ya no quedan matices, la peña se come el mismo juego desde X e Y una y otra vez, pero cada una de las veces más mediocre que la anterior, con menos razón de ser.

They don’t allow Exp share to be toggled off so the game is incredibly easy. You don’t even have to try to win any battles, you can just mash A. The expressionless chibi models are laughable and so are the cutscenes. There are bugs and glitches. The game just feels so bland and lazy. The 2006 games made 15 years ago are more enjoyable.

-Little to no Platinum features (no Charon, Looker, or Villa for example)
-Costs about 9-6 more dollars (assuming you bought DP/Pt when they released for $40) than the originals when accounting for inflation and not including a NSO subscription
-Forced EXP Share, regardless of if you hated grinding or not
-OP Amie buffs upon reaching 100% friendship
-Scuffed following Pokémon mechanic with the same exact issue SwSh had with some Pokemon being incredibly slow even though they literally got it correct in LGPE
-Overworld Pokémon scaling so bad it’s hilarious
-Only the original 493, not even any regional forms which even LGPE had (the same game that also cut cross-gen evos)
-Still has many issues that plague the Pokémon series (Clunky and slow battle system with text boxes for everything, bad in-battle scaling, static/boring idle and attacking animations, lack of difficulty options)
-Instead of Secret Bases you have rooms that you place uninteresting statues inside of and nothing else
-So faithful that it contains many of the problems that DP had that Pt actually fixed/improved, the only problem that was technically improved in BDSP is Pokemon distribution

(to elaborate, playing as the female avatar removes floor reflections during battles as a cheap means of censorship instead of utilizing the most basic level of proper skirt censors) This along with the game having basically no added content, even retaining many of the original games' issues, make the game a pathetic excuse for something licensed by the single largest media franchise in the known universe.

Kidwild,15-01-2022,"For a so called ""remake"". It feels like a RE-BREAK to me! One-step forward. Only to go two steps backwards...pathetic. More like Broken Diamond, and Shattered Pearl.

This Game had potential. But it was squandered, like the last game. Sword, and shield. The game is TOO EASY. (I get it. The newcomers need handholding. But the other folks, would like a challenge DANG IT!)

Being faithful to the OG game. Is not the best of ideas. Especially, if it is going to be a Complete copycat of the DP game. Like c mon... If you are going to perform a remake. Then it needs to be a REMAKE! With new stuff to boot. Not little bit of new stuff. But a TON! Final Fantasy 7 remake managed to remake a lot of their old game. into something much, more bad ass!

THIS!? LOL it's the same game, with a new coat of paint. If you're going for a remaster. Then at the least. make it, With a more quality improvement. to be an overall. Quite a lot better, than the OG game. Or just simply better.

Now this game isn't all bad. There are some new stuff. underground. That is one of the few SAVING GRACES for this sorry excuse of a game. other saving graces as well. At least this game...BEATS Sword and shield. That is for sure.

Not worth the 60$. Not even worth 40$! Only buy this game, If you lack the OG copy of DP. And try to get it for 20$ or less...Else avoid it. (At least this game, managed to be better than the GTA definite edition trilogy. And the Battlefield 2042. AKA COD copy. with worse everything.)

Game-Freak and the other company. and T.P.C needs to Care less on profits. and care more on quality...More staffing members, More time. (not infinite time.

And the Reputation staying in the good/golden side. The reputation is right now...being gravely Tarnished.)

AngryShark92,08-02-2022,"***Apparently there has just been a massive invasion of bots on Metacritic that are out trying to protect the review scores of certain titles, and thus these ratings and this site in general are now completely compromised. The only reviews that get removed are the negative ones, but the 10/10 bots stay up. Sort it out Metacritic. Look at the profiles of the 10/10s if you don't believe me.

No other way to say it, this was a lazy attempt at a remake, not as good as Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, and nowhere near as good as Heart Gold/Soul Silver. There really isn't much here for those that played or own the originals.

I have 3 huge issues with these games. First, this mandatory EXP share is making the game way too easy, it was a big flaw in Let's Go, as well as Sword & Shield, and to include it in a game that did not have it in its original version is a terrible decision. Second, God. Where is Arceus? As of right now, there is no way to get him in these versions, only a transfer from Poke Home if you had him in a previous game. Third, this weird blur effect that exists, which I have seen mostly in Tunnels and Forests, looks awful and seems really unnecessary because it only exists in certain spots and the rest of the area looks crisp and focused so I am not quite sure what purpose this effect has, unless its a bug.

On top of those 3, I have found the game to be slower and more unresponsive in some areas, particularly in battles and conversations, and there are some backgrounds within battles that look ""questionable"", to say the least. Also, where is all of the content from Platinum? Just remake the 3rd iteration of each game if you are going to be this lazy, I miss the distortion world.

Other than those issues, I think most of the aesthetics are great, the music is still great, the animations and models within battles (not a fan of the chibis outside of battle) are well done, and the nostalgia factor still exists, barely. Its a definite lazy effort, and I would only recommend it to newer players who never played the original Gen IV games.

+ Player models & animations are solid
+ Pokemon models are good
+ Aesthetics of cities/towns & surrounding environment
+ Soundtrack has not been ruined
+ Underground content has been expanded for the better

- EXP share is a fatal flaw that makes these newer games way too easy, GET RID OF IT
- Unnecessary blur effect
- Arceus is nowhere to be found
- Some texture issues
- Responsiveness and hangup issues
- Platinum content missing
- A lot of unobtainable Pokemon
- Forgot to add positive modern changes (TM use), but managed to include negatives (EXP share)
- Endgame content is lacklustre to say the least
- Subtle changes from the originals like blocking Wayward cave with strength, and making Eterna's gym different
- Incorrect Poké showing up when using HM move
- Dowsing machine is terribly implemented for a non touch screen console

Overall, it just feels like they got ""just enough"" done and thus I feel like a 5/10 is a justified rating. Gamefreak is obviously turning its attention to games that provide more revenue, and like many other franchises recently, it feels like its all becoming stale because of the lack of quality and effort being put into them. Unfortunate.",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Detorded,22-11-2021,"These are undoubtedly the best Pokemon games on the Switch, but unfortunately this is not saying much. Let's Go and Sword/Shield were weak entries; the only reason Brilliant Diamond/Shining Pearl are enjoyable games is because the originals were good - since all this game does it modernize the old DS games, it is pretty hard to mess them up. However, this is a very unambitious remake and it leaves me disappointed as Pokemon once again misses its potential.

These games are full price (up to $90 in Canada) and they arguably do less than Pokemon Platinum (which released 13 years ago at half the price). The main problems with these games are that they are so caught up in being ""faithful"" remakes that they miss the point of a remake - we don't want to buy the same games again at a higher price and modernized graphics, people were expecting a bit more - Platinum made Diamond and Pearl redundant, and to faithfully recreate Diamond and Pearl is to take a step backwards, not forwards. The bar for remakes had already been set with Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire - which was ambitious, not only nostalgically recreating Hoenn, but adding new and improved features (including an entire new postgame story with Rayquaza). These games are a step back from ORAS.

Again, the games are great fun since DP were good games to begin with - I am having fun playing this game and I am about 8 hours in. Yet, I can't stop reminding myself that these games could have been so much more.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
LCBane,22-11-2021,"A safe recreation of the base games without addressing the real issues of the originals and the implementations Platinum put in order to combat them and create something special. BDSP struggles to find a foothold in the shadow of the incoming release of Legends: Arceus and is a disappointment compared to previous remakes.

Gameplay:
The game replicates all the nostalgia of the originals without including many of the quality of life changes that have been implemented in recent generations. Whether that be unlimited-use TM's
mega evolutions, limited pokedex etc. The game also takes much the difficulty away as less and less trainers have the reinvigorated rosters they included in Platinum. Spare Cynthia and the EF who actually have properly spec'd teams EVs maxed and all. With a mandatory exp share your levels soon far exceed those you face as the Pokémon in your party passively gain more exp than ever before and this cannot be turned off. Without going into too much detail there are still many many glaring issues in the games code letting you surf across trainers and dry land, soft lock in unprecedented areas such as gym puzzles and even completing the game and becoming champion with 6 or 7 gym badges only. Many more issues come from not being able to pick up items, losing items or even the strange clerical issues like frame rate changes when you turn off all sounds the game just runs better.

The return of older mechanics that were not properly updated sees many disappointed in this title as well. Honey trees having a small chance of any pokemon at all when activated and the rates on those pokemon are low already. The changes to the great marsh are also present with atrocious rates as well. All of the date and time mechanics are blocked behind a 24 hour cd if the system changes time when the game is started. Meaning if you got the game on friday and were looking to get your drifloon you would have to wait an entire week after you defeated team galactic. You could change the date and time to carry over to next week but still have a 24 hour cooldown in order to get your pokemon encounter.

Story:
The pacing of the story is still at a standstill removing even more of the difficulty from the originals with bugged/broken friendship and affection systems that multiplicatively stack granting your pokemon higher crit rates, first move regardless of being outsped, living on 1 hp over and over, even getting rid of status effects on a whim. Pair this with the omission of the changes platinum took to keep you moving and involved in the story it slugs on with its main story at a snails pace with zero post game offered.

Graphics:
Returning to something reminiscent of the original games was a good approach however the chibi art style does not mesh with the blocky tile system of old well. However the graphics in battles are some of the best we have seen of any switch title. Despite the lack of improvements in battle animations and move animations the overall feel and look of the pokemon, characters, and backgrounds is great in battle. A sharp contrast to the plastic, dead world outside of combat. Sadly however the rest of the game looks like a reskinned DS and the technologies age shows in the tile systems movement and feel around the world.

Music:
The music is a fresh take on the originals and brings life to where the graphics aren't to scratch. The new renditions are great reimagining's of their inspirations and provide a great feel when playing. The overall level of quality to the sound design and music is great but lacks some of the spark a full orchestra had with the music of sword and shield and other recent titles.

Overall:
Much more can be said about what I enjoyed or disliked about this game however the main points are clear. These games are simply a time sink for fans and the pokemon company and nintendo wanted a free money grab with zero effort and left it to a subsidiary licensed company. little to no imagination was brought to reinvigorate and improve these games from the original. including the bare minimum to keep the masses buying, Sitting in the shadow of what's to come with half baked Legends: Arceus, BDSP fails to create a rendition of the originals that stands up to previous remakes such as HGSS and ORAS let alone what Platinum accomplished to improve the generation.",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC

YourLocalChonke,21-11-2021,"Very slow, not smooth, and unpolished experience. Locked to 8 directions, which would be fine if it didn't snap you to the grid when you moved left, it made the games' movement feel unnatural. Can only run at 30fps, which makes the game feel even slower. When running into a wild encounter, you get a text box, do a move, text box, field effect, text box. Anything that happens will be said to you with a text box which lasts for over 1 second, which doesn't seem so bad, but when you are running into wild battles so often, it gets tedious. Use a move, it says the move with a text box, makes the hp go down, says if it was super effective with a text box, allows the enemy to do the same, so on and so forth. Very, very unintuitive.

jaceace,21-11-2021,"There's no reason to play these games over the original games. There's nothing new, like, at all, they just feel like cheap and easy cash grabs to suck in Pokemon fans.

First - The graphics are horrible for such a huge franchise as Pokemon, theres no excuse for it to look like a cheap mobile game - which even then, some mobile games to a hella better job at it. The chibi look and overworld and ""being faithful"" is nothing but a sorry excuse to do as less as possible, to literally copy and paste from the originals.

Second - Who is this game targeted at, cause not even my 8 year old kid thinks they look good, he called them ""baby"" looking, I really think the pokemon company is completely out of touch with the fanbase and dont even know who it is theyre actually targetting anymore, theres no consistancy in terms of graphics and art style, the last 3 generations have all had a completely different artstyle and direction that its a huge turn off cause it feels like the franchise is going backwards instead of forward, theres just no love or effort being put into it anymore, these games are definitely going back 10 steps.

Thrid - Like I said in my opening, theres nothing new, unlike the other remakes (FireRed, LeafGreen, HeatGold, SoulSilver, OmegaRuby, AlphaSapphire and the Lets Go games) they all introduced new things, more content, expanded storylines, expanded dex, included their 3rd version upgrades, updated character designs, updated towns and cities and environments, heck, some of them gave us new pokemon and new forms, these games gave us....nothing, not a single new thing! Every single thing is either completely the same as the 16 year old original games, right down to the design of a fricken tree! Some things have even been extremely dumbed down - The contests, theres absolutely nothing to them anymore other than pushing a button now and then to a stupid rhythm game, theres literally nothing more to contests, the only other side content to the games!

Fith - The Underground - Its slow, its boring and extremely repetitive, ok cool, we can catch some pokemon that arent found in the dex till post game, but when its old pokemon that have been around for 20 years and weve played with a million times before, its extremely boring! Cutting pokemon from all gens past gen 4 was such a stupid idea, the underground also removed secret bases and decorating to instead add in statues and hardly do anything, the underground is somewhat pointless other than to get some extra pokemon and even then, theres nothing new in that.

All in all, I dont recommned these games to anyone, if you want to Sinnoh experience, go play Pokemon Platinum - it has a lot more features and Pokemon and its a game that came out 16 years ago - The fact people are saying that the originals has more, should tell you how much of a low effort, cheap cash grab these ""remakes"" (More like dumbed down remasters) are.

I don't deny they did some good like HM's not being forced, customization and the underground mons letting you get pokémon not on the dex but those sounds more like putting up a flatboard over a huge hole and calling it a bridge.

Or revert to Pokemon X and Y by allowing us to turn it off. I hate feeling trapped by how I should play the game, give us a choice.

Im not going to write a novel of a review since i thought the contests and underground explorer changes add tons of gameplay time.

Now i understand this is for ""children"" in some peoples eyes, but a large percentage of the player base are adults who grew up with the series and have played and bought every game released. Ive been reading didnt blog posts and cannot understand how nintendo/gamefreak cant see the large exodus that will happen if they dont tweak the difficulty (or allow the users to turn the handicaps off). Greatly disappointed by this remake, not in relation to the presentation, but due to the handicaps placed on an already easy game.

That is another point id like to make. Those of us who played Red and Blue as children, we know how difficult that game was. Guess what, we beat it over and over again while learning and sharpening our skills. Stop babying and spoon feeding the current gen of kids. Its unnecessary.",5,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Melonpanic,29-11-2021,"As someone who loves the franchise, but who skipped generation 4, I am finding this game to be almost the perfect Pokémon experience. The faithfulness to the original means you have the look and feel of the earlier games, which some may prefer, but with a few modern quality of life improvements thrown in, above all, the ability to sit on my couch and play on a TV! I would gladly give this a 9 or more if this had some extra content thrown in on top of the originals and the few bugs (which I have not encountered myself) had been addressed prior to release.

I don't really understand the criticism of the 'chibi' style overworld graphics, I think they are charming and chibi Dawn is really cute! The in battle graphics are really nice, with clean but detailed backgrounds and a really beautiful colour palette overall.

The only negative point is that for some reason someone thought it was a good idea to make TMs single use again... why? :'(
I'm not a fan of how the pokech was implemented, as it is a bit annoying to use, but that's because it needed the second screen the DS had to be use easily, and the switch doesn't have that. This isn't really ILCA's fault, but it would have been interesting if they managed to use the online phone app as the second screen.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC

LiirThropp,30-11-2021,"Even when it's obvious they were heavily limited by Game Freak, ILCA handled these remakes very well. Let's not forget that the instruction was a 1:1 remake from the originals, so they didn't have a lot of space to innovate, but graphically it is WAY better than Sword and Shield.
It also puts the level of complexity and exploration that we had 10+ years ago side to side with the barren and boring gameplay of Sword and Shield.
That said, it is a buggy mess. I happen to find this very entertaining, but it certainly won't sit well with a lot of people, especially since more than a week has gone by and no patch for the most game-breaking glitches is in sight.
The only thing I have an issue with is the price. It is definitely not worth $60, if it was $40, it'd be perfect.

MGamer490,29-11-2021,"I still remember close to 15 years ago when I got my hands on a copy of Pearl, was only a teenager at the time and didn't have a DS so I borrowed my Cousin's DS to play it. On the first night I was up until 5-6am playing it in bed rather than going to sleep, I had an absolute blast. When I heard of the remakes, I was excited to return to Gen 4, but as with any Pokemon game that releases, I will definitely play it, because even the rough ones, they are still great games.

Graphics - Well they have definitely been changed up a bit! At first I was against the new design, but over time it grew on me and I found it to be very cute, as did my partner who was playing Brilliant Diamond alongside me. It felt very much like the original, no major changes in terms of the layout of the game, but the graphical improvements made it feel somewhat new and refreshing which I enjoyed. The Pokemon battles themselves reflected the newer games being in a 3D environment which is what I would have expected, I will always cherish the sprite based battles but these 3D battles is the way it should be and remain from now on.

Changes - There isn't a whole lot of changes besides a few things such as an exp share that cannot be turned off so your Pokemon will level up despite not being in battle and this can make the game pretty easy, early on I was training up to 25 different Pokemon (no lie) to keep their levels lower and have a bit more of a challenge, you can also access your PC box from anywhere after a certain point in the early game much like the newer games, so that will feel similar to the younger crowd or newcomers who are familiar with these recent Pokemon games, it doesn't bother me necessarily, it is more convenient, I just wonder if its better to have an option to turn EXP share off. You have the Poketch app as well, playing docked makes the app a little difficult to manage as it was used a 3DS tool with the touch screen in the original, so that can be a bit annoying but if you are playing handheld, no major issues besides having to load it up on screen to use it. Not many other changes really come to mind, it feels very much like the originals for the most part.

Bugs and glitches - There were some minor issues, occasions where the screen would take a while to load, and even a situation where my partner was in a battle and she clicked on a move to use but the screen just stayed still and she could not doing anything other than close the game and re-open, having to start where she last saved, I didn't experience this issue myself but it did feel like the quality we'd expect from this series was lacking just a tad but not enough to ruin the experience.

Common complaints - Lets just put this on the table because I am seeing negative scores purely based on these reasons - There are no major changes in this remake, there is no national desk, they didn't base it on the Platinum version etc etc. This seems to be a review bomb of negativity that will forever plague the Pokemon series because people are unhappy they are not being given exactly what they want despite clear signs of what the game is from trailers and such. I personally am most fond of my time with Pearl, but also Pearl was made with the new pokemon in mind, and the Platinum version expanded on the pokemon a bit more including ones from previous games, but I don't need them to include the whole pokedex, Pearl and Diamond was there as an introduction to a new world, a new generation of pokemon and this is the first experience people had with generation 4 so giving that experience to newcomers of Pokemon is not a bad thing. There is also the complaint that there is no major changes in the remake but I can guarantee if there were major changes, then people would complain about them changing too much. Its my personal belief that people are expecting way too much from these games at times when this is nothing more than a remake of a classic, just because it isn't based on your favourite one (Platinum) then I don't think its fair to give it a 0, you knew what to expect when you saw the names of the games advertised. So if you are like me and just want to return to Pearl and Diamond, or you are new to the series, then definitely pick this up, you will have a great time, and I never really have a bad time playing Pokemon, its always good fun.

Final Rating - For Pokemon fans like myself who wanted to go back and play the original with updated graphics and some minor changes, this is great and I finished the game in less than 10 days just because it is so easy to play and have a good time. If you are wanting more from the remake then I would suggest maybe skipping this one as it doesn't do anything overly different to the original.",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

The Art Style gets a lot of hate, but this game is gorgeous, the battle animations are great, the character models have ... well.... character and the shadow, reflection and water effects are the best in the series. BONUS: It also runs flawlessly on the switch!

Besides that you will need a Nintendo online account to use it! My score would be higher of this was fixed. I don't and have never supported looking previously free content behind a paywall.

my first pokemon game in a long time
I havnt played a base line pokemon game since silver way back in the day, so I was excited to hop back into the remake of the 4th gen.. and while this game is great, its just not as magic as I remember pokemon games being.. The 4th en of pokemon introduces 107 new pokemon and none of them are really any exciting, as usual you start by choosing your favorite starter, and this time youre on a journey to stop team galactic whos going to these lakes and snatching up the regions legendary pokemon… and the story is pretty straightforward and therefor not really all that interesting..
Diamond and Pearl are very straightforward games in general, go through the routes, building up your team of pokemon which btw share exp from the start, so I had to do absolutely 0 grinding to beat this game… go to the gyms, take town the leader, get a badge, get an ability to progress through the world, an ability that you don’t have to attach to a pokemon to use, another change I love vs back in the day.. so no longer are you forced to have a party of pokemon for certain moves to progress the game, you no longer have to save spots in their move sets for a move you don’t really care about all that much..
But that’s it, that’s the game.. 30 hours of go from this town to this town… It was enjoyable but it was also a bit of a disappointment.. this wasn’t a world or story ill remember, there are no cool mysteries to solve in each town, they all kind of blend together.. This is probably one of the most forgettable monster collecting games ive every played..
That being said its still pokemon, its still addicting to build the best team possible trying to catch them all if you care to…

Dragonfire14,02-12-2021,"It's a shame that these remakes are better than the actual next entries in the series (Sword and Shield). Even though BD&SP (Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl) are better, they are still flawed and no where near what a modern AAA release should be. Missing content, removed content, weird art style, missing options, and bugs are all taking away from making these remakes great. Are they terrible must avoid games, no.

Graphics:

The art style in these games is a bit strange. They basically took the original DS games and upscaled/polished them. It is strange to look at, but could be overlooked if the animations and in battle models were fantastic, but they are not. Animations are again lacking and and basic. Pokemon developers refuse to fully utilize the hardware and add animations in that amount to more that using the transition and rotation buttons. This is just a nit pick of mine, but I wish shinies were actually hand made and not a simple hue shift.

Content:

These games are remakes, so expecting something completely different is out of the question, but expecting a better experience than the originals is what I went into them with. These games are missing a ton of platinum content, all event content, nerfed contests, and removed game corner. The contest change was the biggest hit to me. They completely threw them out in the remakes changing them into a shell of their former self. Instead of a multi staged mini game it is simply a rhythm game without the rhythm. The removed Arceus, Darkrai and Shaymin events are currently not in the game, but Shaymin has been proven to be in the game through glitching out of the map. I know that in the past these were events later in the game's life, but these remakes should of included them in the base version. Then there is the glitches, there are many. I won't go super into detail here, but a quick google can outline them for you.

That being said these remakes do make one awesome change to content, the underground. The Grand Underground is amazing, and let's you catch a ton of Pokemon not in the game. Secret bases are a bit simplistic and boring now, but the rest of the Underground is so fun.

Options:

The biggest issue with missing options is that exp share is stuck to be on. While I don't mind it since it just eliminates grind time for me, a bunch of players are upset with the lack of difficulty this creates. I hope this option gets added to the game.

Conclusion:

While I'm happy Pokemon is back on track to be an actually good game after the mess that was SW&SH, I think these games could of been so much better. I don't know if it is Gamefreak or The Pokemon Company that is holding the series back, but something needs to give. The Pokemon series itself needs an evolution, it needs to finally enter the modern gaming levels, and use modern technology.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC

PlanetDeadwing,19-12-2021,"Pokémon Shining Pearl (or Brilliant Diamond) is a game that is constantly at war with itself. It's a game that completely succeeds at emulating the classic experience of arguably Pokémon's finest generation - the mighty Generation IV - and the unforgettable spirit of the duo of games that largely represented it. But in both attempting to be as faithful as possible to the original games while also being modernised and in refined for the Switch, it results in perhaps the strangest gameplay experience out of all the Pokémon games. For me, this game constantly alternated between being a happy trip back in time to the blissful golden years of the late 2000s (back when life was simple, everyone got along, the world made sense, and everything felt right) and a somewhat awkward retread that doesn't entirely justify its existence. This game is so unnecessarily faithful to the original that at times it feels like playing a really shiny port rather than a true remake, and at times it's surreal seeing things about Diamond/Pearl that now feel somewhat dated being celebrated by the game. From the designs of gyms and towns to the chibi art style and even having the exact same Pokémon on every route, this game will repeatedly give you deja vu if you've played the Sinnoh trio multiple times (which I have). But despite these issues, I'm enjoying this game so far, simply because, let's face it - Sinnoh is, and always will be, a realm of absolute magic, and it's impossible not to get sucked into it for hours. It's a shame that there wasn't more done to it though. It needed more stuff from Platinum, more new things and more improvements to old things.

Poochingus,03-01-2022,"This was so much of a let down. This is the first time a pokemon main series remake has removed content and features instead of adding them. I don't know why they made this game if they were going to somehow make it worse. What was the point of this game? Multiplayer in this game is about on par with the technology from the gameboy days. Yes, it hasn't been this stripped down since gold and silver version. No more global trade. No more multiplayer union rooms either. Underground multiplayer was also gelded. A sad sad sad game. Everyone bashes the art direction, but to be honest, that is the least of my concerns. It is terrible gameplay that really ruins it. There are tons of bugs and glitches. Exp share has no toggle anymore either, which was the worst change added in the previous games and completely ruins the balance of this old game. They included no post game content, where omega ruby/alpha sapphire added amazing post game story and it was fun! These games added nothing, and removed more too. Platinum content simply consisted of just letting you catch giratina and get his origin form. Also they did not include the more fleshed out story for team galactic. Controls are also pretty weak. The originals had great menu layouts and touch controls, they removed the ability to touch menu items for some reason and the menu in combat is pretty weak too. In good form they did not have a fun or engaging post game challenge area. I'm really sick of the battle tower for the 5th or 6th game in a row now, its just the same old thing and it is more luck based than about trying to fight skillfully this time around more than ever. Gameplay is sluggish, despite speeding up movement and hp bars, it doesn't matter when you can't do what every good rpg has been doing for a decade now by having the ability to speed up the combat encounters, and I wish I could turn off the ""friendship"" emotes, just more wasted time. The little things add up to just annoy you to death and mash the A-button. Loading is also so slow that I thought I bricked the console when I first opened the game.

JimPickens,04-12-2021,"Pokémon BDSP is remarkably disappointing simply by virtue of being a remake of a heavily flawed game that was improved greatly already with Platinum, unfortunately however is not a Platinum remake.

The original Diamond and Pearl were slow and agonizing to play, the Regional Dex was comically unbalanced against fire types, and just about every single aspect of the games were improved in Platinum, the games third revised version. I generally do not like Gen 4, I don't care for DP or HGSS, but I do like Platinum, I love Giratina, I love Cynthia and I love the Sinnoh region, Piplup is my favourite starter, so I feel these remakes have already shot themselves in the foot when they decide to remake the objectively inferior versions instead for no other reason than to be able to sell 2 copies of the same game to idiots who'll eat up anything GameFreak throws at them.

BDSP fixes some issues with DP, namely the speed. Originally they were unbearably slow, showcased in an infamous video of a Blissy's health going from 655 to 0, taking 34 seconds. So BDSP already places it's best foot forward by having the game run at Gen 8 speed, then shoots that foot with its art style. Yes the age old complaint, BDSP looks hideous, the chibi art style looks fine from a distance but the game loves to do lose up's of characters during dialogue and it looks pretty rough, Cyrus in particular really suffers here, I just can't take him seriously when he's so gosh darn adorable and cuddly looking. While the style does look nice for cute things, that doesn't really work in a game that debuts Giratina, which I'm sorry, looks like the Gaping Dragon from Dark Souls, it just does, I'm right goddamnit. You would think the cute chibi art style would go great with Pokémon given how easily they could turn them into adorable little chibi models... they don't. For following you around, rather than making the models chibi to work with the characters, they just scaled them down, so Giratina looks like an 8 legged dog and not a giant, terrifying dragon thing. Not helping matters is the following animation, for most it's fine, but some Pokemon like Ekans suffer greatly, because Ekans does not slither, no no no, Ekans slides along the ground in his basic model as if attached by a string, it looks horrible, not least of all because the animation already exists in Let's Go, and could have easily been reused, ILCA are just incompetent, not lazy.

Combat isn't slow anymore, but feels incredibly slow, it's the same old static, boring turn based combat, which is really disappointing when we exist in a post-Persona 5 world and have seen Turn Based taken to a logical extreme and how engaging it CAN be, Pokemon just refuses to, ironically enough, evolve.

Story hasn't bee changed much, still fun and engaging, still would've liked it if they used Platinum over DP but oh well, can't sell two copies of Platinum I guess.

Pokemon BDSP is not bad, but it's not any better than the original Diamond and Pearl, which makes it still worse than Platinum, which it really shouldn't be. The moment to moment Pokemon gameplay will always be fun to me, so I can't say I didn't have fun here, and hell, I can't say I didn't ENJOY these games, I absolutely intend to go back to these at some point and play them again, they're the definitive version of Diamond and Pearl, but not the definitive version of Gen 4, which is honestly really disappointing, and I simply can't ignore it's plethora of flaws both inherent to Diamond and Pearl, and unique to the remakes.

PixelatedOdyssy,07-12-2021,"I love this game, I grew up playing the original on the DS and this hits the nostalgia hard. Putting that aside, these are still good games.
Are they perfect? no
Are they fun and true to the original? yes

the good: I feel like most of the people giving bad reviews expected as drastic of a change as we saw with sword and shield, which this game was never supposed to be. It has tons of extra pre and post game content, quality of life changes, and everything you loved from the originals. This game was not marketed as or meant to be something more than a remake that's faithful to the original. There are new legendries, extra battles, easier shiny hunting, the new XP sharing system, and the game is more challenging than the originals at a lot of points. Basically if you like pokemon or liked the original games you will like this game.

the bad: the price, $60 or $120 for both, is steep. I think $30 would be a much more fair price for one game. There were people who experienced soft locks and bugs, I was not one of those people. Since the 1.1.2 patch, all of those issues have been fixed. I know a lot of people wish they could turn off the new leveling system, I think that should be an option as well, but I also don't mind the XP sharing system. They added a penalty for time skips, so if you change your clock time manually then all timed events (trees, berries, timed pokemon, etc) will freeze for 24 hours. I hate this penalty, as they kept in the annoying timed events like trees taking six hour to find pokemon and berries taking hours of time to grow; they should've found a middle ground. They kept the original battle tower and shop, I think this is bad because the grind to level up pokemon post game takes a long time - I like how easy it was in sword to get XP or rare candies to level up and try new teams, this is a quality of life thing that should've been added. I also think they should've kept the sword and shield shiny hunting and IV hunting methods, the new additions are good, but not preferred imo.

the mixed: some people complain that there are glitches you can exploit to duplicate pokemon and items, I personally think these are fun and since they only effect your offline play that they do not hinder the game or other people at all. There are also glitches that let you get timed event pokemon early, since this only effects offline play, I don't see it as an issue and it lets you play the game at your own pace. The post game grind feels like its too much, in order to get legendries you need to do a lot of tedious farming, this could've been optimized better.

Overall. the games are what they were marketed to be, a new coat of paint with a few quality of life features added. This game is far better, especially after the patch, (although its annoying they didn't fix the issues beforehand) than the user score suggests. Its worth playing.",9,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Emanuel317,08-12-2021,"Fiel a los juegos originales... las gráficas me parece bien y sus modelos ""chibi"" en cuanto la dificultad cuando tienes revancha con la campeona de la región es muy difícil con lo cual es excelente pero con el poder de la amistad puedes ganarle fácilmente.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Edea-Tsuki,22-12-2021,"The game lacks of all type of content from Pokémon Platinum, which is the ""Pokémon Diamond and Pearl +"" of gen 4 of Pokémon. This choise is simple lazy and unanderstandable for every fan of Pokémon: why made a remake that don't have things that permits Sinnoh to raise and be liked back as then? Well, the answers is obvious. It's just a product to sold because in the cover is written ""Pokémon"". Nothing else.
Yes, they added something like the undergrounds upgrade, you can think that all people that tell ""hey this game is awesome buy it now it's Pokémon!"" are right, but it's what we fan asked? It's what we deserve? No. Absolutely no. Nobody asked for this things, we just wanted a damn, exactly the same, Pokémon Platinum with better graphic. Nothing else. Pokémon Diamond and Pearl suck. They have lot of problems, and only Platinum fixed them. So I really don't understand why Junichi Masuda (because hey, do you really think that ILCA have the fault to this? This things that happens to Pokémon X and Y? Remember that Masuda is the boss in all this projects? So yeah please stop to accuse people that for live and earn money have to follow orders), why Game Freak, why The Pokémon Company and why not? Why Nintendo do this every time with Pokémon? This really hurts. They neither need to make any efforts. They only have to do what we asked from years. So why?
Onestly I don't want to hear nothing about Pokémon. This brand disgust me, it's like an unrequited love that know your feelings and smash them just to get something from you. Please stop buying Pokémon games like this and concentrate on some ""more and gentle lovers""",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC
thebrutaltruth,25-12-2021,"One of the worst games I have ever seen.

Alepod,04-01-2022,"Nice graphics and fluid gameplay but it is easy during all the main campaign and it becomes truly hard only in the Pokémon League, I’m not a fan of the chibi sprites and I think that the history could be expressed better if it was not chibi, plus the dungeons are easier than before before the HMs or because some elements have been cancelled. If we think at them as the entrée for Pokémon Legends: Arceus it is good and… FINALLY the text is written in an easy to read font, seriously, I have problems at the right eye and I was able to read perfectly during all the game, though this font was introduced in Sword and Shield.",7,POKEMON,METACRITIC
RealisticStance,07-01-2022,"When they first announced this, I was ecstatic. Growing up with DP, this was something I had been looking forward to for years. The recent decline in quality with pokemon started to make me skeptical about what would become after all.
It's not really bad, it is pokemon afterall. It's just disappointing. The devs seem like they were trying hard to make this a remaster more than a remake, but at the same time they changed it up enough were it isn't a remastered.
They made the exp share for the whole team permanent, so now there is not really any skill needed. You can say that I'm an adult, so of course it's easy, but when I can just walk through the game, barely grind, and end up 10 levels higher than the next gym leader, you know there is a problem.
The fact that the Sinnoh dex isn't the platinum one irks me, as it was expanded for a reason. Platinum dex pokemon are in the underground now, so why not just go the extra step?
The lack of traps and capture the flag just bothers me. What was the point off removing them? It's not like they didn't want to put effort into the underground. They expanded the whole map and added the pokemon encounters, so what was the issue?
Why were the mythicals given so early? They're obviously overpowered, and they sort of ruin the flow. I know you could simply not use them, but the kid inside me wants to use them to win as easily as possible.
Following pokemon being brought back is cool, but why make them use realistic moving speeds? If they're slow enough, they'll just keep teleporting to you. HGSS got it right with with just having them be right behind you.
Nothing similar to Delta Episode? They could have just used Platinums story if they were feeling extra uninspired. Just not much new content? Sure, we have ""new"" content, which just changes the structure of things that were in the originals, or brings back old features, but nothing that hadn't been touched on before. Every other remake had added on a lot of lore or activities to the story, so why should this one not receive the same amount of care and attention? The only other thing I can really say is that HGSS is the prime example for how a remake should be done. This game did not really follow it.
(Music is phenomenal, though that doesn't make up for the cons of this game)",6,POKEMON,METACRITIC
Darkred401,27-03-2022,"If you want a diamond and pearl remake just get platinum

Bdsp changes so little that it would be smarter to port the original. The game has nice lighting and water effects but the overall art style is ugly and loses the appeal of the original pixel art. The music is the one positive with great mixing though certain themes feel off or lose the original appeal.

Ultimately it feels like a rushed cash grab to have an annual release",2,POKEMON,METACRITIC

Lucaro,09-07-2022,"What a sh*tshow.
Pokemon Platinum was one of the first games I have ever played and is one of my favorite games of all time. With all the remakes that came out for the other Pokemon games, I knew that a remake to Platinum must come at some point. I have waited so long and then I got this: A game with ugly chibis, Pokemon Go graphics, the flaws of Diamond and Pearl that were already fixed in Platinum and this friendship bullsh*t.
Pokemon was always a cash cow but back then they actually gave a sh't. This was the last newly released Pokemon game I've played and I am very disappointed.",3,POKEMON,METACRITIC
DolphinReviews,20-07-2022,"When Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shinning Pearl was announced during a Pokémon Presents, I thought I was dreaming. The gameplay and animation looked so laughably bad I could not believe a billion dollar company would make this. Let alone sell it for $60! The lowest point of the Pokémon franchise by far. It looks as if a 5 year old was tasked with character design. Reviews have compared the graphics to a mobile game which is incorrect. Mobile games have far better graphics!",0,POKEMON,METACRITIC

nzmetacritic,26-09-2022,"Hi all!

I have bought this game recently, like 3 days ago and by far I have had the best experience ever on this game. I have the original copy on my DS version 10-15 years ago but I don't think I ever got to finish it. I loved it back then as well. If you are looking for an Nostalgic/original pokemon classic linear game. This is the game for you. I have never played any pokemon games after Gen 4 so playing this brought me back so many memories on why I loved pokemon in the first place. I love the Isometric top down camera angle of this game. I hope to see more other pokemon games in this format. A remake but in 3D graphics makes it more beautiful and inspiring to look at. Being able to explore underground and catching wild pokemons and knowing what to catch just made the game more appealing. However I love the tall grass wild feature not knowing which pokemon is battling me. It is more challenging this way. I hope they still continue this style aswell.

Looking at the negative reviews on this game don't make sense to me. I think going open world for pokemon is also a great idea too but I think Gamefreak should definitely focus on the quality, the story, the amount of content than rushing to finish a game every year.

Back to the review; It reminds me of ''Pokemon Battle Revolution'' and this game happening all in one instead of buying 2 separate games. I hope ILCA will continue this genre. Personally this game is what I wanted 10 years ago. I am enjoying every moment of this game, it is super fun and addicting. I would like to see Gold and silver remakes including my all time favorite Emerald.

Negatives. Not Worth $100 NZ because it is a Remake and its literally the same game not much new things or expansions even added to it. its weird that SW/SH is the same price.
I notice 1 thing versing the gym trainers use the same pokemons that I have fought from normal trainers. Wish for more diverse and varieties of Pokemons when it came to the gym otherwise its too easy!

8/10 for me Good job ILCA",8,POKEMON,METACRITIC

cHughes,07-12-2022,"Pokémon fans may have thought the series could not steep any lower following the release of the Let’s Go titles, however somehow GameFreak manages to top the lows of even those childish Kanto remakes. What’s worse, these were remakes of many fans’ favourite generation of Pokémon games, and favourite overall region, Sinnoh. The games took ‘faithful remake’ way too seriously, with absolutely no change to the original Diamond and a pearl formula. The games became boring after a few hours of play and could be categorised as the original games with a ‘lick of paint,. The one positive of these games is the ability to shiny hunt the mythic Pokémon, even that is being generous however. The games are utterly disappointing and upsetting as a Pokémon fan. Lazy, lazy instalments.",1,POKEMON,METACRITIC
