FireFistYamaan,03-03-2017,"I love how this game is so good, that triggerd sony and microsoft fanboys are just giving it a 1 so that the score will drop! Amazing game!

Story is amazing with cutscenes that are epic.
Soundtrack is very good also and will probably grow on everyone.
The mystery of what exactly happend 100 years ago is very tense which makes the story intresting to follow.

Overall fantastic game, Nintendo have outdone themselfs!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
fire_fist,03-03-2017,"Simply breathtaking and stunning. Nintendo have created something special with this game. Whenever I think I've seen it all, it surprises me suddenly with something I didn't see coming. This is definitely a masterpiece that I will continue to play for years to come.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

johnardo,03-03-2017,"Stunning in every way, While everyone thought that this Zelda would just copy new games and lose its identity, it showed everyone else how its done. What an amazing time to be a gamer",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jardeson,03-03-2017,One of the best gaming experiences of my life. It's hard to describe in words and I can see why some people would feel very salty about not being able to play this game. Masterpiece.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Geraldst20,03-03-2017,"Nintendo ha demostrado que puede innovar en una era donde todo ya está creado, estos 6 años de espera han merecido toda la pena es un juegazo que todos deberían de disfrutar. Han acertado con el mundo abierto, el ciclo día y noche, el clima, las tribus, historias, doblaje, diseño artístico, banda sonora, jugabilidad, dificultad y la combinación de todo eso ha dado como resultado una obra maestra.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bimbarabim,03-03-2017,"The fact that there are so many people hating, giving zero instead of an appropriate score, only shows how the excellence of this game is disturbing. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the best game in gaming history so far, already surpassing Ocarina of Time as the highest critically rated game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
triskyhd,03-03-2017,"In the starting area "" great plateau"" there is endless amounts of things to do and it feels huge! I climbed a mountain to find a shrine and it felt like such a journey. I felt accomplishment something you rarely feel on video games these days.
This has to be without a doubt game of the year, and as my experience with the game continues i feel like it could possibly be the best game ever made.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Sadikusama,03-03-2017,"Believe the hype. I was skeptical at first, seeing so many 10s and 100s given out to this game. I went blindly into Breath of the Wild knowing nothing about it except for the main trailer of the game. Hours into the game I can only agree: this game is a masterpiece.

There is so much contect, so many things to do, so many places to explore. You are given complete freedom in this adventure, you can even try to beat the game as soon as you start. Freedom and exploration are perhaps the best gameplay aspects, without leaving behind the sheer amount of actions possible: cooking, riding horseback, climbing... Whether you actually beat the story is also up to you, there is so much to invest in this game you might never grow bored of it.

Go play this game. Now. This isn't your typical 10/10 game, it goes beyond that. This game is now videogame history.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
xDeniz,03-03-2017,Down with the fake reviews! I totally own this game and it is awesome!Playing it on the Nintendo Switch is great! I hope Nintendo can launch other great games during Switch Life Time.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
XxGurkeHDxX,03-03-2017,"First of all do not listen to all the 0s. Most of them haven't even played the game and are only bugged because Horizon Dawn has a lower score.
To the game: It's awesome! It's my first Open-World Game and i'm completely stunned.
After an hour in-game you can go wherever you want and whenever you want. And this game is not easy, which is a great thing, considering how easy a lot of games are nowadays,
I know some of the textures aren't the greatest, but I'm not a graphic enthusiast, so it's alright.
There are some frame drops (TV-mode only), but that's nothing that lowered my enjoyment of the game.
I like the new direction Zelda goes, because it's different from the previous games and I can understand when people say they don't like the open-world thing. I also wasn't very happy, when I first heard, that the new Zelda is going to be open-world.
All in all this game is a masterpiece, even though I don't think that this game will be revolutionary like OOT.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
silver_silver,03-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is potent mix of pure Nintendo magic with a strong dose of modern, open-world sensibilities.

NInteNoob,04-03-2017,"So my first day with my switch has been wonderous, exciting and fun filled!

[B]What an amazing console nintendo have produced.. the day started off with the courier knocking my door at 11.10 am with the switch and within the first 15 minutes i had it setup, updated, downloaded and installed FAST RMX.

At only £16.99 and under 900mb it couldnt have been a better deal and used minimal system memory to have a HD RUMBLE multiplayer game that runs at 60fps and 1080p, it looks stunning amd the soundtrack is pretty awesome too.. but.. my Grandad (who hasnt played a game since the playstation 1) beat me! But i was pleased he did as it showed us just how many people can enjoy the SWITCH.
It's a pure gaming experience and fun too!

An hour later and my Zelda collectors edition, the collectors guide and my case and screen protector set had arrived.. and i'm simply blown away. The game is beautiful, subtle and deep, it's one hell of an adventure and it has only just begun.. i wont say any more because it is something that has to be played and on a console system that you have to experience.

I have experienced no Joy Con issue's, no low frame rates, no stuttering or overheating.

I have just taken my first step off of the great plateau and as my adventure lays ahead of me i cant help but think that this time round its also Nintendo's turn to take the leap of faith from off of a great plateu and into the Breath Of The Wild,.

Bravo Nintendo, Bravo",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

EpicLadySponge,03-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild broke a lot of records in the history of gaming. By that, I mean it is most likely impossible to find one thing wrong with this game. It's like Nintendo took the base of Ocarina of Time and modernize it to make it look like this game over here. This is why Nintendo will forever remain in my heart no matter where it all goes. I'm telling you this, Breath of the Wild has everything... yes, every... single... thing that made Ocarina of Time look like a masterpiece. This is the lost brother of Ocarina of Time and the true brother Ocarina of Time will ever need. Just go buy this game, it wants your money so bad, it wants you to play it so bad, it wants to be your local friend literally bad. I'll be waiting until you get this game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

grungyssj,03-03-2017,"This game is the most beautiful game I've ever had the pleasure of playing. The game is huge, and yet dense with so much to do in this large, open-world. People wanting a more traditional Zelda title won't get what they desire with this title, but that's not a bad thing. Breath of the Wild is a breakaway from the series that breathes new life into the series just like Ocarina of Time did back in its day. This game is essential for anyone and everyone to own and play. Why are you reading this review??? Go out and buy this game now!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
gintoki125,04-03-2017,This game is amazing. It's beautiful and It's so fun I just could not put it down. I love going around and exploring and doing the side quests.

Prodromus,03-03-2017,"Game is fabulous.
Everything about this game sparks the player’s intuition and rewards them with satisfying results.
The world reeks of charm and every town has multiples of interesting NPCs that still have the classic Zelda quirkiness.
Combat is very dynamic and fluid and the ability to challenge yourself by going into later stage areas has a perfect risk and reward feel that encourages you to keep going. Plenty of times I had to remind myself that I should properly follow the main storyline after half an hour in uncharted territory looking for treasure.
The game has its issues like any game does. The Frame rate drops being the biggest issue, but I can think of plenty of games that had frame rate issues on release and now run smooth.
Personally I would rate the game a 9, but I’m giving a 10 to try and counteract the obvious troll reviews bring the average down.
Must buy for a Switch owner or Zelda fan.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Fred_GameOnBatt,03-03-2017,"Finally a worthy opponent for OOT!
The epic world of Hyrule that Nintendo has created is the culmination of the saga The Legend Of Zelda, with the best physics engine we've seen. A video game that will go down in history for its quality and the freedom it offers the player.
Regretfully for Wii U, Nintendo has removed the exclusive console greatest game that has developed the company in its history, Zelda: Breath of The Wild, giving a powerful reason to the world, if you have a console in which play this game, buy it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Krypticus,03-03-2017,"This game is truly amazing.
- As a hardcore Nintendo/Zelda fan who has been waiting for this game for 5 years, I can say that it completely surpassed everything I thought it would be.
-The world size is incredible, and every bit of it is filled with fun things to do.
-The storyline, while it is somewhat ""relaxed,"" is amazing if you take the time to actually go and focus on it. --
-Other than that, simply exploring the world is super fun too.
-The items you can get are all either fun, funny, or incredibly useful and the combat system is great.
-The inventory is set up in a somewhat weird way but works fine for me.
-I'm not even that far in(at least, I don't think so) but I can tell this game will take me hours upon hours just to complete the story and will keep me interested for years.

Schoolboy_hew,03-03-2017,"The game is great. As for those saying it is boring or too easy I don't agree. The direction of the game was to explore and solve puzzles. It keeps the Zelda charm while building on the past models.

pg_x,07-03-2017,"It's quite funny to see how many people can't stand getting a game a highscore because it isn't available on their platform of choice, It's a huge problem of Metacritic that every **** can rate a game they probably just have seen in a 30seconds commercial. Will I give Horizon Zero Dawn a 0/10 because some Sony Fans have nothing better to do than hating on this great game? No, as soon as I'm completely done with Breath of the Wild I will play Horizon Zero Dawn on my PS4 and hopefully enjoy it too. Gosh grow up kids, this is getting ridiculous here.

I have to admit, I'm not a huge fan of Open World games and if you are also not a fan of those you probably might end up enjoying Breath of the Wild less than previous games of the franchise. Don't get me wrong, I also play open World games but beside of bugs that are always present - which is kinda fascinating because I haven't seen a single bug in Breath of the Wild, yes it has some slight framerate issues, but nothing that makes it certainly less enjoyable - there are always things that could have turned out better in a less open world. For example Red Dead Redemption (for me a 8/10): it's huge Wild West world is great, has a lot of atmosphere and the story is pretty nice, but - not mentioning other flaws here - a stronger focus on the story would have me pleased more. Sure there are also examples where an open world IMO simply works, but that's mainly because it doesn't get to big which is kinda an issues in most modern open world games, bigger is not always better. Well, Zelda IMO doesn't have these problems, there is always something to do, being it enemy's, something you can hunt, NPC and so on... getting to your goal you might pretty much always find something interesting that can distract you if you wish for it. For it's enormous size it's surely an amazing world, it feels like it's breathing... living and way less like an simple scenery you have to complete your quest in. You don't need quest to enjoy it, but while there are is an enormous amount of smaller sidequest, I wouldn't have mind to have a few more main quest, be it as it be if you can enjoy yourself in a huge sandbox you most likely will love this game. The two biggest issues I have with this game are for once the story, I know you don't have to expect to much from a Zelda game but I have fallen for their trailer and expected that they would finally give us more, this game breaks pretty much all conventions this series has in the last 30years so why not? Yeah... don't expect to much, but if you have seen the trailer you will already know a good chunk of what there is available in form of cut scenes... I surely would love a Zelda game following the events that happened a hundred years ago... unfortunately Breath of the Wild doesn't give me enough to fulfill my expectations. The other issue I have with this game is that it kinda lacks of being ""The Legend of Zelda"", probably I would give it a 9.5-10/10 for being the best Open-World game out there but it wants to be a Zelda and with that in mind you might end up disappointed about all those broken conventions , IMO they took it a little step to far. It wouldn't have hurt the game if all the shrines weren't solvable without Items you HAVE to find in a Dungeon or somewhere in the world, those always have added variety to the Zelda games an I simply miss it, there is a good chunk of shrines but you can solve them all with the functions of the sheikah-slate (and a bow), needing a hammer/boomerang/magic rod which you can find in this world wouldn't have hurt but as a Zelda fan I would have wished for a few big dungeons with ""unbreakable"" Items to find and use in those shrines. Don't get me wrong, those Titans are pretty close to a Zelda Dungeon (beside the bosses not having a certain week point due to the lack of special Items) but just four of these in these BIG open-world wasn't enough to satisfy my thirst for ""The Legend of Zelda"", hell not even Hyrule Castle is a god damn dungeon, why Nintendo? WHY?

All in all Breath of the Wild is an amazing Open-World game and on it's own it outshines similar games - while you shouldn't expect a story driven RPG as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt of course - but as a Zelda it comes a bit short in terms of having big and complex dungeons in which you can get lost for hours, well at least you will find yourself exploring this world for a good chunk of time even if you intend to walk pretty straight to the Titans and beat Ganon.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

darthshadow25,03-03-2017,"This is a game that takes the best aspects of gaming goliaths such as The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls, Portal, and Assassins creed, then mixes them up in a cooking pot with the traditional Zelda games beloved by so many. The result is a game that can rival the near perfect, polished game that was Ocarina of Time. While not truly innovative (but let's be honest, innovation of a concept is far less important than perfection of that concept), Breath of the Wild brings together dozens of mechanics and systems, both new and old to the series, and blends them all seamlessly to create an intuitive and exhilarating experience that few games can achieve. With so much content and so many ways to tackle that content, this is a game that can keep people enthralled and immersed in the world of Hyrule for dozens of hours with its simple but deep combat system and its fantastic platforming and physics puzzles. While this game is nothing short of a masterpiece, there are minor flaws. It's voice acting is often flat and due to the open nature of the game the story doesn't feel like a pressing matter. The former never really detracted from the experience, but it certainly didn't enhance it, while the latter is simply a tradeoff for the wonderfully open world where players are given enough freedom to make a libertarian blush. The last complaint that I can make and have seen other people make is about framerate. Nintendo does not make strong hardware, they never have, and Breath of the Wild pushes that hardware to the extremes sometimes, resulting in chugging framerates and sometimes even complete pauses in gameplay in the most stressful of situations. This isn't due to poor coding or an unoptimized game (see any Bethesda game), but is due to a hardware limitation fully out of their control. To complain about the game's performance is to complain about the hardware, and because these slowdowns hardly detracted from my enjoyment of the game I can look past them. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that brings together so many amazing things from so many amazing games and blends them seamlessly and intuitively. I cannot articulate how intensely I believe that everyone should play this game. This is the defining game of this generation and if you enjoy RPGs in any capacity this game should be right on the top of your list to buy.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Now the newest Zelda game is finally here and puts players back in Hyrule where they must protect the kingdom from the ferocious evil that is Calamity Ganon after being asleep for 100 years. Breath of the Wild breaks out of a lot of classic Zelda traits, while instilling new ones and simultaneously making the world and game familiar for veterans, as well as accessible and eye-opening to new players alike. Breath of the Wild is unlike anything we’ve ever seen before, not just for Zelda standards, but for gaming as a whole.

From the moment you get out of your slumber, you’re invited into the stunning portrait of Hyrule, painted in an exotic green, with the perfect blue hue of the sky and red rays of the sun. It doesn’t take long before you’re on your own and adventuring out into the wilderness, trying to recollect who you are and find your way back as a noble swordsman like you once were.

Breath of the Wild’s map size is huge. Really huge. The gigantic portion of the Great Plateau in which you begin is only a spec on the massive open world you’re put into. However, despite the size, it is surprisingly easy to find your way around thanks to landmarks and other cues that guide the player through the story and where they need to go next, but that doesn’t stop you from going off, exploring, and climbing wherever you please – or even going straight to Ganon if you so choose. It’s quite remarkable how Nintendo was able to build a game so big yet so coherent without ever losing a sense of value or direction. Everything you do feels like it has a purpose, and even if it may not seem like it right away, there will always be something down the line that rewards you for your efforts in whatever it is you do and how you choose to explore. Side quests among other tasks all have a reason and aren’t there to artificially increase the longevity of the game. Every task, every quest, every action impacts you and Hyrule as you see it.
Hyrule is your playground. Now that you have the ability to go anywhere and do virtually anything, you’ll have to be well equipped – not only with a hefty amount of stamina to climb and run, but with equipment as well. Your weapons will deteriorate and inevitably break over time, which is why you should always be on the lookout for new ones, especially those that enemies drop. Sometimes you’ll feel like you’ve conquered a certain area because you see it as “the easy part of Hyrule”, only to get hit by a flame arrow seconds later that take nearly eight hearts off of you in one hit. Always be on your guard, and if you see your weapon is about to break, you can always throw them directly at an enemy for a critical hit for one last hoorah before having to switch (snap) over to another to defend yourself further. The same will apply to your shield and arrows, and each have their own attributes and strength, so carry whatever you feel is necessary. Even if something is of an extremely low value, when you don’t have much with you, it’s always good to take it with you just in case. I can’t tell you how many close calls I’ve had only to be saved by my measly low level laughable weapons thanks to throwing and headshots. A battle of wits will always conquer a battle of strength.

Breath of the Wild introduces a new cooking system, and it’s an exciting mechanic to say the least. Those familiar with creating recipes by combining various materials gained from monster parts the items scavenged throughout the world in Monster Hunter will have a lot to look forward to. You can take just about any five items in your inventory and throw them into a cooking pot, and chances are it will make something worth having. I’ve noticed, however, that combining elements that make the most sense will give you the most reward. It’s no different from cooking in real life. Vegetables go very well with other vegetables, but sometimes meat will complement the dish as well. Maybe you’d like a nice steak with a side of carrots? Go for it. You’ll gain ten hearts for that alone. Or maybe you’d want to go the seafood route and cook some salmon with suateed mushrooms? Go for it. That’ll restore fifteen hearts and give you a temporary stamina boost as well as an increase in cold resistance. It’s all left up to the player how they want to cook, and with enough food to make the world go round, the possibilities are endless. Every dish will provide you with something useful, even the extremely gross ones.

This game is just simply stunning and amazing! Game of the Century. Called it here (first).",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

NBT,03-03-2017,"An almost perfect game. The game is strongly about its game mechanics and exploration .. having invested several whole games after i got the an early copy i sit with the feeling that this is a major change to its core game play.

First of all ! if you hate exploring then you have already a problem . The game really shines at its exploring and its the core of the game. The story comes second in the game .. so far it is not a bad story but its a bit short on main dungeons. Luckily shrines make up for most of it and if you count them as mini dungeons you get allot out of the game. Though the main dungeons have a cool mechanic i really loved and i would have loved to see more.

The world is huge and its filled with content and fun thinks to do. Finding new thinks or finding Kor-oks ( DAM SPELL CHECKING !) puzzle is just a blast for me even the shrines are really fun. There are secrets in places you would never expect, Important resources can be found every where also in places you would never expect it to be at places when you just look at the full map. Again personally i feel the focus and the best part lies outside of the main story but the main story has also very good content and story .. The only negative thing i feel about the game is some of the voice acting tied into the main story. It lacks feeling and sounds like some old person reading out of a boring history book where he tries to read it in a way that small children find it more interested. Voice acting is odd often and i feel personally its not fitting the story very well .. Happily voice acting is not a big part and other parts are allot better. Personally this game is a 9 out of a 10 for me but i made it 10/10 because lots of troll spam here already with 0 reviews ( guess they are jelly that they don't have this game on there other consoles) There are not allot of thinks really dragging this game down and they are mostly only minor like HOW THE HELL TO YOU MAKE POTIONS ?? the game could have guided you a bit more but there is almost no guiding you from a to b something that forces you to explore and find the next spot. My last negative thing i feel is that some other mobs and all guardians are extremely powerful and it seems so far there is no easy way of killing them even with good gear, The game forces you to use brute force and dodging and here the weapon breaking becomes really annoying. It seems the game wants you to just avoid them. Something that i personally don't like . Mini bosses have most of the time weak spots though and bosses are not as hard as a guardian or some other mob like the centurion. Here the game forces you to change your play style .. again its not often but when you come over that it is really frustrating That's again why i would give the game a 9 out of 10. In the end i still love the game, It is almost a perfect gamer it has game mechanics you normally don't see. I needed do melt ice at one place and i was out of fire arrows and anything that could produce heat but i managed to set an arrow on fire and just walk over with that and melt the ice with that arrow by just holding it ( not even shooting it ), you can cook apples with a torch while its still hanging on a tree. Small incredible game mechanics like this are really mind blowing.

In the end this game has me amazed and i love exploring the huge world that does not lack little secrets in spots you would never have expected them. Its definitely a good mix of exploration surviving and Zelda and its all you could wish.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Forneray,03-03-2017,"The result, for all the longevity of its series and the familiarity of the open-world genre, is a game that evokes feelings we haven’t known for 20 years. Not since Ocarina Of Time have we set foot in a world that seems so mind-bogglingly vast, that feels so unerringly magical, that proves so relentlessly intriguing. Plenty of games promise to let us go anywhere and do anything; few, if any, ever deliver on it so irresistibly. Nineteen years on, Ocarina is still held up as the high-water mark of one of gaming’s best-loved – and greatest – series. Now it may have to settle for second place.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AlexToral_F,02-07-2017,"Como era de esperar, Nintendo lo ha vuelto a hacer, llegando a poner a este nuevo Zelda a la altura del Ocarina of Time.
Si bien las notas pueden haber sido infladas, ya sea por la emoción, el nombre o simplemente porque se lo merece, nadie puede dudar que este juego es una Obra Maestra. Es tontería compararlo con juegos de otras franquicias, tal y como se ha podido observar en las reviews de usuarios que únicamente se dedican a criticar, puesto que cada juego es un mundo.
Centrémonos en la mecánica de los Zelda de antes. Ahora, la cosa ha dado un vuelco y ha cambiado para bien en muchos aspectos, tanto en gráfica, como en diversión, como en historia. La banda sonora sigue siendo excepcional. Los únicos contras que se pueden encontrar a este juego son subjetivos, debido a los cambios. Alguien que se haya acostumbrado a las mecánicas de los juegos anteriores, podrá sentir un vacío, a pesar de que el juego sea largo y el mundo sea vasto. Sin embargo, no olvidemos los Zeldas que añadieron características nuevas o cambiaron los gráficos como el Wind Waker. Fueron criticados antes de la salida y ahora es considerado por la gran parte de los fans y del resto de jugadores como uno de los mejores juegos de la saga.
Tanto si eres fan como si no, este juego hará que te sumerjas desde el primer momento. Un mundo abierto, libre, enorme y vivo rodea esta maravilla de juego que coge todo lo bueno de los anteriores y lo mezcla dando lugar a un videojuego que roza la perfección.

Resumiendo, esta obra maestra es inolvidable. Uno de los mejores juegos de la historia.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AHeroReborn,03-03-2017,"Metacritic needs to step up their game and remove all these nasty, rude 0 scores that are being made with the intention of lowering a game they havent even touched yet. I play video games on the regular, so I dont believe there needs to be an issue. I dont go around leaving bad reviews of things I have left untouched. That is not how you should treat anything. I will not bring much out on Horizon Zero Dawn here, as I have yet to play it, and will get to it eventually. That game looks freaking awesome.

With that out of the way, lets get into the real topic here. The legen of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece! I've waited five years for this game and throughout each delay, i knew it would be worth it. Sure, the conventions may have been broken and we have a new layoit for the Zelda series, bt Breath of the Wild is in every way, the way Zelda was supposed to play from the beginning. The gameplay is astonishing, the voice acting is not problematic, and the story is quite the thing to unfold. I understand that there are fears in this games huge open world, but fret not, its full of so many things to do. From the beginning the Breath of the Wild was always focused on this expansive open world. It doesnt force exploration, rather it encourages exploration. In fact, you have many open choices from the beginning. You can go face the final boss right from the start if you feel so inclined to.

Breath of the Wild is a true thing of beauty and is worth anyone's time. We only get so many games like this every once in a blue moon. With all that in mind, Breath of the Wild deserves a true 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

K-LAWN,03-03-2017,"I'm absolutely blown away. Games like this come once every decade. Everything we had hoped for and more. I was very concerned at first, as Nintendo kept delaying the game. But damn was the delay worth the finished product. An incredible and immersive open world. Funny, lovable characters. Excellent combat. I'm about 6 hours in and the game is starting to get quite difficult. You'll notice this once you can leave the Plateau and are given free reign to travel wherever you want. I got absolutely wiped out by the Guardians patrolling the field in front of the castle. I'm gonna explore the world more and more, before committing myself to the main quest. I really love how this game gives you freedom that is lacking in most open world titles. I don't think that I've been this struck in awe since the days of Ocarina of Time on N64. Bravo Nintendo! Way to prove that you guys are still the best in the business. I give this is absolute 10/10. A perfect game for the greatest video game franchise of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
794,03-03-2017,"Absolutely worthy of the praise it's been getting. I wouldn't even call myself a ""Zelda fan"". I've never played (only watched) any of the other 3D games, and I've only played two of the 2D games (Awakening and Minish Cap). With that being said, I'm rating this on the basis of it being a *video game*, not a ""Zelda"" game.

So far, it's incredible. They drop you into this world filled with life and questions and places to explore. You can tackle and single instance the way you want to. Just from the size and activities to do in the first zone, I can tell this is going to be a very long adventure.

It looks beautiful, it SOUNDS beautiful (man, all the footstep noises and weapon clinks and detailed sounds are amazing), it feels great to play and it feels open. The only thing to say negative about it is, of course, the frame drops. But that alone is certainly not worth docking a point for. (Especially when the other big brand consoles can't even achieve 1080p@30fps with their current games.)

Todo88,03-03-2017,"Let me preface the following by saying I'm only about 5 hours into the game so far. Having said that,

So I'm about five hours in now and really pleased with what I've played so far. I've never finished a Zelda game but I played The Legend of Zelda on the NES, put a lot of hours into A Link to the Past on my GBA, and am progressing through Link Between Worlds, OoT3D, and Majora's Mask 3D on my 3DS. I am generally not a fan of open world games such as Witcher 3, Fallout 3/NV/4, Skyrim, et al. *BUT* this game has me wrapped around it's finger like crazy so far.

Generally I'm anxious about putting off quests and exploring but I've been having a blast just wandering off to areas to see if I could get to them, check out the wildlife and plant life, and see if there are any shrines. The combat has been fun and difficult at times without feeling too punishing when I die. The artwork and sound design of this game are stunning to me. I've seen a couple of people mention Studio Ghibli vibes and I tend to agree.

For now, that's all I'll say. I don't want to get into to much detail because I think it's best experienced with as little information as possible, but needless to say I'm very happy with my Switch/BotW. I haven't had a game live up to the hype like this since GTA:V back in 2013, personally.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Just an example - there is a tough enemy surrounded by easier mobs in the skeleton-head like cave in the very beginning. If you try to kill them all you'll probably end up ripped apart. You can sneak and kill 1 or 2 enemies but not all of them. You can see explosives inside the cave also but how to detonate them if you don't have any fire arrows? There are couple ways: there is a bonfire nearby and you can fire your arrows and shot the explosives or you can see a fire lamp right inside the cave and you can shot it down with regular arrows. There are so many different ways to accomplish the things and you feel extrimely satisfied when you find out the right way!

chad_pattan,27-03-2017,"I already know I'll be attacked because I'm not going along with ""the flow"" of reviews. So let's start out by quantifying that 6. For the record, the last Zelda I played was Twilight Princess. Last Zelda I beat completely was A Link To The Past. Last Zelda I enjoyed was Adventure of Link (the only real ""RPG"" of the bunch, IMO.)

Graphics: 3 points. Yes, half the score is the graphics. They're beautiful. But they're limited, especially on the handheld. World of Final Fantasy on Vita is a great example of how it can be done.

Story: 2 points. I feel that the story is compelling and interesting. You feel like you want to help the world. You connect with most of the characters. Nicely done.

Sound: 1 point. Ambient sounds, voices, music, are all done decently. I didn't hear anything that bothered me, put it that way.

But that's all the game has really. I get it - it's Zelda. It's a throwback to the first game. But quite a few things annoy me, and most of them have to do with UI (User Interface) decisions.

You can't tell when weapons are degrading. I'm generally not a fan of the weapon break mechanic, but I can live with it so long as I can tell the life of my weapon, and I can repair weapons, ala Dark Cloud 2, or that I can easily create new ones, ala Dragon Quest Builders. Neither is the case here and it's annoying.

Weapon strengths are illogical. Why it takes 9 swings to kill an enemy with an axe yet only three with a club makes no sense whatsoever. A fan leaf one-shots flying enemies yet a stick takes two, sometimes three hits. Why?

Link will happily plummet to his death when you try to tell him to gently drop down from a climb to a ledge, and instead he jumps off the wall. I'd just as soon not have a jump from a climb at all.

The button configs are a nightmare. Two different ways of using the Sheikah Slate rather than just one map with functions. Forced to move your thumb down to a touchpad that's not in a comfortable place just so you can switch weapons. Forced to press a tiny ""minus sign"" on the pad just to view the map and a tiny ""plus sign"" to view inventory. One trigger does something, one bumper does something else, another trigger does something else...It's too much! I thought FFXV's was bad, it's a work of art compared to this.

The stamina bugs me only because it's so short. No human is that out of shape. At least let him sprint after a fast run.

For all the criticism laid at the feet of Dragon Quest Builders I frankly felt that its battle ""engine"" was much more logical, as petty and simplistic as that was, for a very similar experience (legendary hero wakes up in a cave with no recollection of why they're there and now have to rebuild the world. Same. Exact. Story.)

The world is massive, and while I do enjoy massive worlds (Dragon Quest VIII is an all-time great for me), the world has to interest me. Navigation is a pain in this game, and I assume they wanted you to feel the ""realism"" of it. But when you're playing a fantasy game, too much reality is not a good thing. (DQ8 and riding on a tiger to get around certainly isn't realistic.)

Game directions are also lacking. You'll get instructions to go to a place, and in some situation it's a breeze, where in another situation they don't even bother trying to at least point you in the right direction. Again, too much realism.

Yes, I know. ""Explore"". That's fine. But clear directions are a hallmark of roleplaying games, and it saddens me to see modern RPGs forget this.

I discovered that the game feels much more ""comfortable"" in docked mode. The framerate drops don't bother me.

It's a beautiful, well storied, average game. I'll keep the Switch in the hope the Seiken Densetsu Collection comes stateside *eeek*, and hopefully Octopath Traveler will be a much better experience. As for this, those that think this is a perfect game certainly must not have played Dragon Quest VIII on PS2 - thus far the only RPG to check off all of the boxes.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
wpatri04,12-03-2017,"The Bad:
The breakable weapon system is flawed because it does NOT redeem itself later by allowing the player to find an ultimate, unbreakable, reliable weapon to give closure to the system. It forces you to deal with its breakable weapons the entire game, INCLUDING the Hylian Shield, and having to recharge the Master Sword. The player NEVER gets the feeling of satisfaction and security and completion knowing he has finally worked his way up and acquired the final unbreakable weapons. There ARE NO unconditionally unbreakable weapons. This is DEEPLY disappointing, and an absolute deal breaker! Even at his most ""leveled up"" in the game, no matter how much time you spend building up Link, he will ALWAYS be forced to walk around Hyrule, as the Hero of Time, with BREAKABLE weapons. Again, this would be fine if it redeemed itself later on, but it doesn't. It's an open-ended, ongoing weapon breaking system. No unconditionally powerful Master Sword or Shield. It's a disastrous decision for the series.
Overworld music: THERE IS NONE. Did you love the sweeping Hyrule music in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess? Did you love the atmospheric overworld music in Majora's Mask? Did you love the liberating sailing music of Wind Waker? Well, it's GONE. NO OVERWORLD MUSIC. And things get boring really fast. The only sounds you get are some random flourishes or taps of piano keys, some quick stringed instrument sounds, and everything else is nature sounds. This is virtually a universal complaint at this point, and a very bad decision by the developers. Music gives the world it's character. Breath of the Wild has to rely SOLELY on the beauty of its landscapes, because there is no overworld music which would have COMPLETED the experience of travel and exploration. Instead, it leaves much to be desired, unfulfilling, and at times boring.
On to the good:
The scenery is breathtaking, the glider is a magical experience, horseback travel is the best of any game to date, and the actual combat gameplay is very challenging, engaging, and much more intellectual and skilled than any Zelda game before it. Skyward Sword tried to become more realistic with its motion controls, but didn't quite live up to the hype that Nintendo tried to make for it. Breath of the Wild's engaging combat is much more natural, much more realistic. The bosses and common enemies are more mature in their design (much less kiddy than Windwaker and Skyward Sword.)
All in All, this is a good game, but a letdown for a Zelda game. It is an open-world (open air) game more than anything else. It does the open world aspects right, with the exception of not including music. The voice acting is mediocre (more British voice acting {For Zelda}), and the story is pretty average. If you are a longtime Zelda player, this will likely disappoint. If you are looking for a change of pace for the series (and i mean a COMPLETE CHANGE), while not doing everything better, then this will be a good choice.

BarronOfDune,13-03-2017,"Eh, it was pretty good, certainly not bad, but not as euphorically amazing as a lot of reviewers seem to be claiming. Here's a rundown:

GOOD
- Solidly implemented open-world mechanics for combat, survival, exploration, and stealth. None of it is particularly groundbreaking but all is done well with the usual Nintendo polish.
- Hyrule is varied, colorful, and appealing, reminiscent of a Miyazaki movie
- Plenty of good music
- While some dislike the breakable-weapon system, I think they implement it well and like the way it forces you to use a wide variety of weapons throughout the game
- I really like the design of the Divine Beasts and the general concept of having dungeons inside these massive lumbering cyber-steampunk monsters
- In general they do a good job of letting you go everywhere practically right from the start, with the caveat that many areas are dangerous and require specialized gear to traverse safely. It gives the world a good sense of mystery and adventure
- Good sense of character growth & progression throughout the game as you gain better equipment, new abilities, and more life/stamina
- They do a good job of incentivizing you to constantly collect whatever you can, as ingredients wind up having lots of uses in cooking and upgrading

BAD
- Story is very thin, and if you don't bother hunting for (totally optional) memories practically nonexistent: ""Calamity Ganon is in the castle! Go stop him and save Zelda!"" ""OK, sure"" THE END
- The characters were pretty weak too IMO. The only one of the Champions who left any impression was Mipha since she actually seemed to have meaningful connections to other people. The rest were blah.
- I wasn't a fan of this angsty, conflicted version of Zelda too, especially since she doesn't get a proper arc: basically she's worried she's a failure because her powers haven't materialized, then they eventually materialize at the last possible moment and everything works out THE END
- Later in the game the lack of enemy variety becomes pretty annoying. Palette swaps of Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos constitute the vast majority of enemies you'll face and it all gets very same-y.
- The prospect of slaughtering and eating countless wild animals (including wolves and foxes) is pretty grim for Nintendo. I must have farmed hundreds of moose for their precious, precious meat and did not feel like a legendary hero while I did it.
- I was very annoyed at the section where Link dresses up like a harem slave to sneak into an all-woman city. That kind of stuff doesn't belong in a family-friendly game, Nintendo.
- The actual design of the Divine Beast dungeons was unimpressive. They're all basically just variations on ""tilt it this way, now that way"" over and over again.
- Hyrule Castle itself was a huge disappointment. I guess it's tough if you actually WANT to spend tons of time poking around and dodging Guardians, but I just swam up the waterfall and climbed up to a window, whole thing took less than 10 minutes
- Once you've beaten Ganon it sinks in that there's not much point in continuing to explore the world, since you're not going to find any bigger challenges and there's little point in trying to get even stronger (especially if that means farming the same stuff over and over again). All that's left is OCD collecting and box-checking.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

wilk09,03-03-2017,The legend of zelda breath of the wild is from now the Best game from the history. Better than the legend of zelda ocarina of time. Nintendo has made a fantastic job with this game. Master piece.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aunite,03-03-2017,"This review will mostly be a response to this game's heaviest criticisms.

Graphics: Nintendo tried detailed graphics with Twilight Princess and has since steered towards a more stylized cartoon-hybrid look as in Skyward Sword. Detailed graphics are not synonymous with good graphics and the consistent style and smooth finish in Breath if the Wild gives it my vote (9/10)

It's not a Zelda game: to be more precise, it isn't an ""Ocarina of Time"" Zelda game. However, the collection is mostly an expansion on Skyward Sword's system, it still has the key characters, the main plot, and more puzzles than any other Zelda game. It is very clearly still in the ""Legend of Zelda"" niche"".

It's the same Zelda: Ironic that this and the last argument show up so frequently. The open world, the weapon hunting, horse taming, limited tools, short dungeons, varied and frequent shrines, etc. ensure that this game is very set apart from every other game in the series so far. You very much feel like a traveler trying to change the world instead of the unstoppable Hero we've come to expect from Zelda. If you don't like that, then see the previous argument.

It's totally MEH: the sheer brilliance of this compelling and insightful argument has left me utterly dumbfounded and without words to form an adequate response. Truly a masterpiece of what I can only assume must be a brilliant and divine mind gracing us mere mortals with its incomprehensible wisdom and guidance.

In short, Breath of the Wild has done an incredible, nearly perfect job of creating a unique and totally immersive world in a way I have only ever experienced in The Witcher. I consider these games on par at the moment, but that is able to change based on how the game continues.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

LawdFrieza,03-03-2017,"Beware the Sony fans bombarding this page. They're insecure that the new Zelda game is leagues above their new exclusive, Horizon. These aren't paid reviews. This game is really this good. Allow me to elaborate.

In almost every 3D Zelda, you're put on a liner path that progresses you through the game. While they still incorporated aspects of exploration, they lacked the formula that was present in the original Legend of Zelda. This game puts you through a short tutorial in the beginning and then lets you wonder off. No hand holding. Hyrule becomes your kingdom to explore. The game has also implemented a quest system that is similar to Western RPGs. There is a main story quest and a bunch of side quests. There are also over 100 mini dungeons known as shrines which feature puzzles that greatly vary in design. The gameplay is quite similar to Dark Souls/Shadow of Colossus. Certain enemy hits will completely deplete your health. Guardians will absolutely destroy you at the beginning. The music is very subtle and its ambience allows you to enjoy the sounds of nature that echo throughout this game. This game is a masterpiece. It scored 98 for a reason. Ignore the user score. Like I said earlier, it's being flooded by insecure Sony fanboys who are upset that this scored way higher than Horizon Zero Dawn. I've played both, and can say without question that this game is superior. Good luck to all of you and I hope you enjoy your adventure in the ruins of Hyrule.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Im not even a nintendrone but, since i saw the first trailer i knew that this zelda was amazing, best game of the decade and probably, best game of all time.

In order to make this review, i sold my gaming PC and my car, i buyed the switch and the game with the 20 dll season pass.

Pros:
-Perfect story timing
-natural and organic ambientation, a lot of trees
-Incredible consistant and solid gameplay, with game mechanics that gives the player total freedom to go across the Stupidly big map of Hyrule.
-sometimes, the framerate dropped to 20 fps, giving a more cinematic experience
-Human and deep characters
-Good IA

Bad things:
-nothing

I rated this game with a 7/10, until i realized that the game have donkeys.

DoomCritic,06-04-2018,"The term glass cannon comes to mind when playing this game–as well as tedium. Before I go into the shortcomings of this game let me just say that this is one of the best Hyrule universes that I have been able to experience in a Zelda game… Now, with that said, it seems that for everything that could have been amazing about this game is then dialed back a few notches with some strange in-game mechanic choices…
Creating fake difficulties with cheap game design, like enemies that give you forever and a day to hit them only to be hindered with your porcelain weapons constantly breaking all the time… Dialog choices that don’t lead to different outcomes (like the damn paraglider tasks). And a little green doughnut that is fighting hard to become even more notable than the tri-force…
So, to sum up my opinion, Breath of the Wild is a great game that takes three steps forward but two back as with features that do not really add to the game’s difficulty or enjoyability as much as attempt to pad the amount of time spent playing it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Everything it tries to do it does successfully and is a step in the right direction for open world games. The combat is simple enough that anyone can pick up and play, while also being challenging because of aspects like weapon degradation and perfect dodges. The puzzles are complex but never impossible because the game gives you all the tools you need for them right off the bat. The game looks fantastic but does have some draw distance issues. I could go on and on about the other aspects of the game but there is no point, you should play it yourself to discover what it has to offer. The game gives complete freedom to the player and despite having some performance issues the rest of the game is good enough to make up for it.

YUIOP10,03-03-2017,"This game is critically acclaimed in a day and age where the worst games are rated 7's, and the best games are rated 9's. Scores have become compressed, which is why when a game like Breath of the Wild receives a 9.8/10 (and edging on 9.9) universally across over 60 review platforms, that means something. BotW is the first game in a decade to receive a score higher than 9.7, and it shows.

The world is beautiful, intricate, and alive. BotW does what so many open world games fail to do: it's a real ""world"" for the player to interact with. There is no hand holding. There are no false limitations. There are no fake loading screens. What you see is what you get.

The gameplay is tight and controlled. You will be punished for your mistakes, and rewarded for creativity. The game gives you your main tools close to the start and you are free to run around in a massive sandbox with only the limitations of your imagination.

All in all, this Zelda title strays far away from previous formulas, which in my honest opinion have become quite stale, and shows an entire genre how to make a game right. Yes, no game is perfect, and Breath of the Wild is not without its flaws, chief among complaints being somewhat dated graphics and framerate issues. But none of those things hamper the game; the positives outweigh the negatives far too much to matter.

I hope Nintendo will take what it learned from creating Breath of the Wild and bring it to every one of their first party titles in the future. I look forward to what is in store for me and my Nintendo Switch on the horizon; ARMs, Spla2n, Xenoblade 2, and Mario Odyssey all look to be amazing smash hits. Thank you Nintendo for continuing to be the standard the industry lives by, and thank you for showing what's possible to all game developers out there.

With 15 hours into the game I can say with confidence that since Red Dead Redemption I have not played an open world game this fun and rewarding, the gameplay is just amazing.

annex7977,03-03-2017,"Not a big fan of Zelda games. I like them but still think they're too formulaic. I prefer the Elder Scrolls games and obviously Witcher 3 (brilliant) and Red Dead Redemption.
That said, BotW is the best open world game ever made and probably the best game I've ever played. I don't say that lightly, I've been gaming since the Spectrum days and I am brand-agnostic (I usually own and play most mainstream consoles of a generation) as well as being a dedicated PC gamer since my first IBM PS/2 256-color VGA in 1990).

The game allows you to do so much, it constantly surprises you with its depth and variety, it removes all limits on what can and cannot happen. It's not a game, it's a whole living, breathing world you can get lost in. No other game has ever achieved that.

Ignore the fanboys on both sides of the fence (both ""10/10 Zelda hurdur"" and the ""0/10 Horizon is better"") and
check out a review or gameplay video for yourself. Today, launch day 2017, this is all you need to be persuaded that this is, without a doubt, a game that absolutely must be experienced by anyone who enjoys video games.

csgopro,03-03-2017,"An absolutely masterpiece.

This game gives a new definition to the open world genre. The physics system in this game is light years ahead of what you see in other open world titles. You're given complete freedom throughout the game, leading to different experiences for each player, rather than one shared, scripted experience. I really wish Nintendo allowed us to use the Japanese voice acting with English subtitled but that can be added in a later date. This may be the best music I've heard in a Zelda title, and that says a lot. Ignore the troll reviews. They're mad that their masterpiece, Horizon, ended up being an 8/10.

Myon-Neutrino,11-05-2017,"People seem to polarize way too much here. If you don´t agree that BotW is ""the best game ever made"" and ""totally worth 10/10"", expect to be insulted, calling you a Sony/Xbox Disciple. To be honest, I´m PC Gamer nowadays and don´t even own PS or XBOX Consoles, but grew up in the SNES-Era and played every Nintendo Console and Zelda Games since. Now I tried the Switch-Version of BotW, I´m about 22 hours in. It is NOT a ""Masterpiece"". It´s NOT ""the best game ever made"" and it´s NOT worth beeing rated 10/10. It´s a solid Open World game and of course it´s fun to play it. It´s a worthy successor to many previous Zelda Titles, such as Twilight Princess and provides a good gameplay experience, ok graphics and the typical Zelda-Feeling you´d expect from the franchise. Well designed, huge world. But on the other hand, it´s far away from beeing perfect and that should be obvious for every gamer out there... Weapons break way to frequently, the inventory and menu handling takes much time, switching weapons or Slate Skills simply takes too long and is not too intuitive. Speaking of the slate, that thing doesn´t offer too many features. Even ""A Link to the past"" had more specific Items which brought a much wider variation to the game. You find Bows all the time, but getting Arrows is a pain in the ass (at least at the beginning) and extremely expensive to buy. Why even implementing Bows at all if the´re not utilized because of constant lack of arrows? The world is damn huge, but kinda empty and lifeless sometimes. There aren´t as many different enemy types as well, you got severe frame drops every here and then (reminds me of the unbearable slowdown of some NES games back in the days...) and in conclusion, I truly can´t understand those Critic review rankings of 97... Zelda: BotW is very good, but not THAT great.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Toast1124,14-03-2017,"Its just ok. Simple. Don't listen to the Nintendo fanboys; this is NOT a perfect game. Let me explain:
Cons:
- The story is good, but I haven't found myself really into it. There isn't any real urgency to it. Just do what you want and oh yeah maybe save this princess.
- Weapon durability system is actually awful. I'm not saying the mechanic is bad, but this game does it awful. Nothing ruins a game more than giving you something cool only to take it away a few seconds later (And i'm serious, weapons break in just a few swings in this game. Nothing like Dark souls).
- Combat is just meh. Everyone claims that the durability system is to encourage you to try different weapon types, yet the combat is just so bland. Sure, maybe this is great for casual players, but this game doesn't feel like it was made for new gamers.
- The side quest are very generic rpg quests. Nothing like The Witcher 3 's quests which would draw you down a rabbit hole of action, adventure, and feels.
- No crafting?? Only crafting is cooking food that give you boosts. Thats it.
Pros:
- The game world is beautiful. There are things to do everywhere it seems. Only gripe is that the switch cant handle it, but that's not the games fault i guess.
- The puzzles are all really creative and take full advantage of the rune mechanic.
- The world is really open. Go anywhere, do anything. There are a few ways the game limits you from just running to the final boss of course.
- The physics in this game is great. Light a bush on fire, let it burn the whole field, and ride away on the updraft. You can be really creative in this game because of its great physics engine.

In conclusion, its just another open world rpg game. The fact that Link is in it doesn't make it any different. If you like Zelda games, grab it. If you want a open world rpg with, maybe get Witcher 3 or Dark souls 3.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
FastSmith7,03-03-2017,"I'm very sorry but the love for this game is based purely on the fact that it has Zelda in its name. It is a very good game but no more than that by todays standards, terrible voice acting, the framerate is awful, the combat gets repetitive after a few hours, the story isn't great either and climbing is just silly and unrealistic. However, the exploration is wonderful, combat is fun for the first few hours, the world is beautiful and brimming with content, there are many fun puzzles and the atmosphere is spot on, it isn't enough to warrant a 10/10 though.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Stuvok,13-03-2017,"Combat is OK but the puzzles are garbage. If you think picking up a rock and placing it in a circle, throwing a rock into a circle, or pushing a rock into a circle is exciting then go ahead you'll be doing that 200 times. There are a few good side quests and a few good surprises but most of what you find is endlessly repeated simple Korok puzzles that you need to do because of how annoying the equipment breaking system is. You need the extra slots because how fast weapons become useless and break. If you enjoy Dungeons you need not apply because this has the worst dungeons in the entire Zelda franchise. They are no more than simple puzzle rooms with almost no enemy's.... the one enemy they the boss are also the worst in the franchise. Bosses almost with every other monster are either going to kill you in 1 hit or if you spent a little time powering up they will be so weak you may not even need to block. Bad menu's that you constantly use, bad voice acting, bad writing, bad story, bad lip-sync in some scenes, bad side quests.... Very little of this game is up to modern standards. If you think cooking should be quick and easy to prepare before battle well that's not this game. Maybe in the Witcher you can instantly fill up everything you know the recipe for but in Zelda you need to spend 30 min crafting each individual meal waiting through the 10 second jingle to finish after every one. This annoyance continues through the whole game... you'll need to sit through 5 loading screens to finish each shrine and most of the time they aren't even worth it. Shines are generally just very simple puzzles with no visual difference and they pale in comparison to open world puzzles used to unlock shrines. Even worse are the shrines that are 5 loading screens just to enter an empty room with a chest. Things Zelda was good at are now broken! Even things like the lock on system is garbage. Its still worth playing but its not the masterpiece reviewers keep saying it is.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kayno1,04-03-2017,"I originally gave this game an 8, but the more i play, the more i start to feel that this game is a huge dissapointment. Most of the time is spent running around aimlessly in the empty world, while the rest of the time is spent hitting enemies with a sword over and over again. Not to mention every enemy in the game is pretty much the same, but with different colours and skins. The game overall can be a lot of fun at times, but these times are so rare compared to the boring and repetitive ones. The framerate drops are also something that definitely brings this game down, as it is too noticeable to just brush off. I really don't understand the praise this game is getting, especially since it doesn't have enough variety or innovation to call it a ""masterpiece"". I will say that the art style is very pleasing in certain areas, as there are some places where this game looks gorgeous. The story is also very interesting with some really nice voice acting, and the game does give a great sense of adventure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Attila_The_Fun,16-03-2017,"Okay, so I beat the game to give it a final review and I must say I was reallllly disappointed. I'll just make my list now.
Cons:
No enemy variety. Maybe 8 total enemies in the game reskinned several times.
Shrines are boring and take about 5 minutes or less to complete.
4 dungeons in the game if you can even call them dungeons that is. These dungeons are just huge empty spaces with one 20-minute puzzle and a boss.
Calamity Gannon shot at me one time and stood there the rest of the fight.
This is somewhat of a nitpick, but the music is really bad. If you have such an epic open world area the music should not have been soft piano. Ocarina of Time of time felt like an adventure with the music.
The framerate is also very bad on the Switch. It was advertised to run at a ""smooth 30 fps"" and it doesn't if too many enemies are in one area and especially around the Great Deku Tree.
The rain mechanic is very annoying. You can't just start a fire and wait either because that puts out your fire. So, then you need to go back to a town or a covered area and make your climb all over again.
Chests are kind of pointless. They all hold some crappy weapon that breaks in a couple hits.

Pros
You can do a lot of silly stuff, but that's about it.
The visuals look nice when they don't lag.

That's about it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
msanders78,04-03-2017,"After waiting for three years for this game, I have to say I'm not impressed. The graphics are ok, the music is ok, the game is....actually kinda boring and repetitive. I love Zelda games, Windwaker is my favorite game of all time, but this game didn't draw me in like WW or OOT or even ALTTP. I didn't really care for SS and after four hours in, not a big fan of ABOTW. This game feels like a bad version of Elder Scrolls, not a Zelda game....hate the collecting, cooking food?, weapons break...often, Link is resurrected like Christ...is he a god now?, load times are often and long, lots of space on the map...lots of walking/riding, with nothing there, the quick travel takes forever to load next area, .............and on and on....also the first Zelda game you can't change your name, or have three save files....two stars...an ok game, NOT A LOZ GAME!",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Clarion,04-03-2017,"A nice open world, but brings really nothing new to the table.

TsukasaHiiragi,03-03-2017,"Sadly, the Zelda fanboy army and obvious paid reviewers are giving this game an artificially high rating whilst in truth it isn't *that* good, there are many glaring issues right now, and the game does get repetitive after about 20 hours in, especially after grinding shrines/temples over and over for little reward.

BotW would have been better if you didn't get all the tools and equipment you need within pretty much the first 20 minutes to an hour into the game. The gameplay is also questionable, with strange difficulty spikes basically saying ' you shouldn't be in this area yet ' so you die in one hit, whilst you don't lose anything you can lose durability since your weapons don't last forever and eventually you're going to need to craft items and especially potions.

The crafting elements aside, the game is a psudo mixture of Dark Souls meets Skyrim? The game can be brutally difficult at times, and have a nice balance the next - whilst this isn't neccessarily a bad thing, I'm sure it could cause some player frustration.

Whilst I think its a good opening title for the switch, the 90+ and especially 100s are all vastly over-rated scores, and shouldn't have scored that high. Sure this game is good, but it isn't that 'great' but its a worthy title to hold the Zelda name.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DarkLordGig,03-03-2017,"Simply an amazing game. Good art style, good music, and overall really good atmosphere. A highly expansive overworld littered with shrines and enemies and NPC's will keep you playing for hours.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Delmale,13-03-2017,"A lot of what needs to be said has already been said but wanted to reinforce some of the faults (mainly so that we don't see a game like this again in Zelda series).

Pros:
• Combat, for those that enjoy twitchy dodge and parry soulsborne mechanics (like me) you can basically dominate this game and it feels very rewarding.
• Graphics are beautiful. Normally don't like this sort of art style but its very suiting to the game.
• Exploration. You can climb/traverse practically anything in the game. Perilous path on your way to that tower? Stock up on stam pots and climb the mountain up instead.

Cons:
• Story and characters feel very shallow. Main story characters are very underdeveloped which leaves you wanting for more. How can you expect players to like any of the characters when you give them only 10 lines.
• Music is very underwhelming for a Zelda game
• Waiting times are ridiculous. Upgrading a piece of armor? watch cutscene. Discover shrine? Cutscene. Cooking food? cutscene. Korok seed? Cutscene. Wouldn't be complaining except you have to do it so many times it gets obnoxious.
• Everything just seem so repetitive. The 4 main dungeons are basically giant puzzles. The bosses are practically the same, shoot the eye, get in for damage, repeat with 1 or 2 minor new gimmicks. The champion stories are practically identical, there's an king and an underling, somehow related to the champions of old. It just seems lazy. Majority of side quests are your run of the mill ""fetch my sister a baked apple"" or help us kill these boars. Monsters are basically copy pasta with new skins.
• Performance. Not that we didn't already expect this given the specs on both the Switch and Wii U. It's frequent enough to actually ruin immersion (straight up freezes at certain parts).",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Algoros,03-03-2017,"Everywhere new things to discover, amazing story and ""wunderschöne"" graphic
thx nintendo
This can be the best game ever if the DLC are the last 2 Prozent",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
QueenBrahne,16-04-2017,"Combat: Shallower than other 3D Zeldas like Twilight Princess which introduced some fancier attacks, or Skyward Sword that let you have full 1:1 control of the sword. This plays like a dumbed down version of Dark Souls. Very few combo or attack strings per weapon, very little enemy variety, mostly recolors. All the weapons breaking is a pain in the ass and means you constantly have to switch weapons, as all loot in the game is rewarded for side quests you're essentially doing these quests only to get consumable items that make no long term impact on the game.

Story: Non-existent, you get cutscenes of Zelda giving expository dialogue and everything else is indirect and/or unexplained because it's too deep for you I guess. The Zelda game could not boast to have the best of storylines, but they at least tried, this game is well below the mark for the series. It's very disappointing how they handled Ganon in this game. The ancient evil has awakened! For what is meant to be a ""modernizing"" game in the series, they reduce the story back to the basic level it was in Zelda 1.

World: It's very big yes, but in terms of what there is to do, this game has essentially 3 or 4 dungeons depending on how you count them, compared to 7-8 at bare minimum for all the other 3D Zelda games. Besides these disappointing dungeons, the game spams shrines. Shrines are very very short versions of a dungeon that all look the same but have different physics puzzles where you throw balls into cups or make balls go around a bend or maze suspended in the air. You also can go open world ""seed"" side quests where you have to run up a hill really fast, throw boulders/balls into cups in the ground/ocean, the kind of thing you'd do in Assassin's Creed.

Music: Indefensibly bad compared to previous 3D Zeldas. There is mostly no music for the majority of the game, and what music there is just isn't very good. While not as bad as the New LA theme in Xenoblade X, this is not outright bad music, it's not going to be anything that people listen to for years like the themes from previous Zelda games. I can't say it's too surprising given the general design of the game when there's very little to really get inspiration from for a theme, there's barely any character or boss themes.

Of special note is the terrible voice acting in this game that may as well fall under the music banner. The voice acting is horrendously bad and this is the first time they have tried to do voice acting in a Zelda game. Zelda herself sounds like a stereotypical British woman and her delivery is extremely wooden. Most characters/NPCs still don't talk anyway, and a Zelda game with random, bad voice acting frankly breaks the immersion, if everything else not feeling like Zelda didn't do that already.

Graphics: It looks nice but does it really compare to other recent open world games that it is obviously heavily inspired by? Compare it to FFXV or MGS5, two other recent Japanese attempts at doing an open world Elder Scrolls type game, they look much better. This may be because Nintendo is working on Wii U development at the same time and the Switch hardware is new, but do not expect to be blown away by the graphics in this game. The art style is different but can't help but feel it looks a lot more bloom-y and oversaturated than even Skyward Sword, I have a personal preference for the N64/TP's art style but this style honestly doesn't even do the style as many favors as Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. The frame rate drops constantly to the point of being unplayable.

In conclusion I am not a hater of this game and I do not care about whatever console wars are going on with the user score here, this game is offensively bad to me as a fan of the series since for decades. This is no longer Zelda, it's just Nintendo trying to cash in on the latest trends of open world Western games. Didn't work for Final Fantasy or Metal Gear Solid either and this game will lose its shiny critical acclaim soon enough when people look beyond the shallow ""big open world"" that clearly got all the focus in development.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AwooGirl,03-03-2017,"If you enjoy just messing around in a large, beautiful world then this game is perfect for you, lots to fiddle around with and definitely worth your money. Someone looking for a more engaging, focused experience will find Breath of the Wild somewhat lacking however. It's an okay game, and I hate to say this, but I can't think of it as anything but a bad Zelda game. Regardless I will give it a 5 since there are definitely many that will enjoy this type of game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Goo4you,16-09-2017,"There is far too much ""rose-tinted glasses"" syndrome going on with this game, professional reviewer and user alike. Let me be clear upfront; I don't ever think any game is either a ""10"" or a ""0"" there is no such thing as perfection in the medium (good or bad). Yet, after spending time with this game It came very apparent to me what this was:

The biggest amalgamation of game tropes the world has ever seen.

There are so many mechanics in this game found in other titles it is astonishing. Skyrim, The Witcher, Fallout, Farcry, Dead Island, Assassin's Creed just to name a few. I've played this game before that's all I kept saying. Are these things found in these titles bad? No, of course not, but i've done it already. The magic those titles brought is wiped away in BoTW. They were handed better in those games, whereas Nintendo took the root element of those mechanics and slowed down progression to neigh-on a crawl.

Breaking weapons, small stamina gauge, lack of armor, lack of health, lack of mobility. The amount of labor this title demands to be at least comfortable in content is beyond strained. It feels like a F2P game without the ability to actually pay for SOME things. It is tedious, everything about this game is tedious.

The soundtrack (or lack there off) was a bad choice. Why they thought just the sound of nature alone for the majority of the game was a good idea is beyond me. It became jarring, making me uncomfortable. We've been conditioned for so long to have some kind of music in the background at all times made the constant silence make my skin itch. At least they should have given the option to have a traditional score playing tastefully in the background.

I've also heard the comparison to the original title and how it left the player to fend for themselves and figure things out. This, is nominally accurate. The problem with this line of reasoning is flawed in a few ways:

1) The map of the original Zelda was of a manageable size
2) There was near Zero collecting of side mission items
3) There were no day/night cycles where certain things appeared in game
4) Control was fully in the hands of the player and all base abilities were there with zero hindrances. Items and equipment made the player stronger.

There are also issues with optimization, because my lord does this title chug a ton in tv mode. Framerate issues are a plenty. Also the art style falls between muddy wind waker and sharper Ocarina of time. The lack of ANY REAL button mapping is a shame. Item management is infuriating (the damn cooking! Why do it this way!) The lack of a auto load a weapon when one breaks is silly (or shield or bow).

I've played Zelda since the original, and while brunt of this review is negative, at the end of the day, it's a Zelda game so the heart of the adventure is still the same. Does this game deserve a 10? God no, or a 9 or an 8. It's nice to see Nintendo as a company do something fresh and out of their comfort zone, but if copying things from titles in years gone past as fresh, they need to go back to the well; especially when titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn took the same approach BoTW did and did it so much better (and cleaner).

It is worth buying BotW, but don't accept the lauded hype: it's fine, it's fun, it's not a game changer.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MyceIium,12-03-2017,"I'm honestly very disappointed in this game, and the Zelda community in general. First let's start with the community. I have never seen such ""fanboyism"" over a title before. I understand that people have their own personal opinions on the game, and that is totally fine by me. If you think this game is a 10/10 masterpiece, then by all means, enjoy the hell out of it! What bothers me is the communities need to belittle or trivialize the negative reviews as just being the symptom of ""switch jealousy"" or having some vendetta against Nintendo. I can assure you that this is not the case with me, and that I sincerely hoped that BOTW would be an amazing title in the Zelda franchise.

Unfortunately, I have been severely disappointed in this hope, and here's why:

-The World: While extremely vast the world has an empty and repetitive feel to it. Many of the areas feel barren and void of character, like they were simply added make the game feel bigger, without adding any actual enjoyment or discovery value to the game. There is a shockingly small amount of enemies scattered throughout the game as well, and you will often run into the same enemies over and over again, with out a slight change to their coloring or weapon they are armed with.

-Dungeons: The dungeons in this game are a joke, plain and simple. First you have the shrines, which technically aren't ""dungeons"" but serve a similar purpose in the game. They are meant to be challenging puzzle rooms much like you would find in previous installments of the series. Key word here is ""meant; because they are so brain numbingly easy that they quickly become stale. On top of that, they are almost all identical (outside of their puzzle content). They all share the same music, aesthetic look, dialogue, and end goal of receiving a spirit orb from the shrine guardian. I found myself bored after the first 10 or so shrines, and was dejected that I had to go through the same experience another 100 times in order to complete them all.

The main dungeons- Vah Medoh, Vah Naboris, Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, and Hyrule Castle play like a larger version of the shrines. While they do have their own art styles to set them apart, the puzzles contained within are very uninspired and easy to solve. I felt no challenge what so ever finding my way through these. On top of that, all of the dungeon bosses feel the same. Shoot a weak spot with arrows, then attack when they are weak.

The Music: The music in this game is terrible. Whoever had the idea to go with ""minimalist jazzy"" type of music for the game should be fired. It totally ruins the game in many areas. The Hyrule field and combat music were especially annoying to me, and became part of the game I hated after having to listen to them enough. Some of the village music, Kakariko Village especially, were good,but this was not enough for me to forgive the otherwise terrible choice of music for most of the other locations.

Questing- All I can say is boring.. Whether is was collecting korok seeds or doing the mainline quests, the entire system seemed uninspired and boring to me. Much like the shrines; quest just felt like a tedious grind after awhile.

Performance- The game could be quite beautiful and striking sometimes, but often times it looked like a past generation title. On top of this, the performance is often abysmal, with fps dropping to below 20 for extended periods of time. This is simply unexceptionable for a AAA title like this, made by a company like Nintendo! On top of that, the game only supports 900p resolution, which is just insane for any game made in 2016-2017.

Final Verdict: If all you care about is exploring a vast world set in the Zelda universe, then you may enjoy this title.; but if you are like me and are hoping for depth and innovation, I don't believe you will find it in BOTW.

Sincerely,

A dejected Zelda Fan",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Spakiness,13-03-2017,"In response to Boogie2988, I should have been more clear in my definition of open world. I consider this game to be a good start into the modern genre of open world games. I also find that your reviews are just as bad as mine. Thanks for cutting out a majority of my review.

Pros
• Unique hot and cold mechanic
• Interesting flow of motion between paraglider, shield surfing, and climbing.
• Voice acting but only sparingly.
• Fun photo documenting mechanic

Cons
• Long loading screens and wait times. Numerous long animations that should be skippable. Such as the drop on the Sheikah Slate and others. A quarter of my time with the game is just waiting.
• Consistent frame dips and even freezes at times.
• The world is boring. Each region is exactly the same with a color swap and monsters sprinkled throughout. The Sheikah architecture looks ugly and all the dungeons feel the same.
• weapons are made of paper that break after a few hits. Resulting in annoying weapon management process
• Locking on monsters is a pain
• There is no way to gauge how much damage a monster is going to do. You can expect large monsters to hurt, but then sometimes random lower tier monsters can delete your health bar.
• Tedious cooking process.
• insanely high monster tracking. Attacks are very difficult to dodge resulting in an experience that feels unfair.
• The entire experience feels tedious. Climb tower (which takes forever), go through repetitive dungeons, run around in the barren landscape, and repeat until you beat the game. It just feels like they are trying to make the experience longer for the sake of making it longer.
• The combat is mindless hack and slashing.
• The Sheikah power ups just feel gimmicky.

You would be far better off playing a game with real combat like Dark Souls or an interesting open world like Witcher or an interesting story like Bioshock. This game would never reach such high ratings if it didn't have the Zelda brand.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Mooglemagoogle,04-03-2017,"THIS GAME IS NOT PERFECT

It is insanity to me that people can play this game and give it a perfect 10/10 score when the most important element a video game should have is missing: FUN
Simply put, this game is not fun. It is beautiful, it is breathtaking, it is large. Beyond large. So large it is breathtaking. But it is not fun.
As a die hard Zelda fan since birth it baffles me that people are too blindsided by the massiveness of the world in this game to see how bland and obnoxiously tedious every second of the game is. Let me explain why this game broke my heart into a million different pieces which I won't be able to pick up off the floor because this game no longer features heart pieces.

- Initial reaction:
Breath of the Wild was made for the Wii U. The concept of having the wii motion plus as a swinging sword in Skyward Sword was swapped for the concept of having a gamepad in front of you to act as your menu, your map, and to feature inventive ways of using items throughout the game. All of this was utilized when Nintendo designed Wind Waker HD for the Wii U. And all of this was scrapped for Breath of the Wild when Nintendo decided to have it released alongside the Nintendo Switch which doesn't offer a touch screen gamepad. So we were forced to wait an extra year and a half for a game to be dumbed down from it's original design. Within the first 5 minutes of playing this struck me as a huge let down but I knew the game would be so epic this major set back wouldn't matter. I was wrong.

- Gameplay:
Nearly every tried and true mechanic from the Zelda genre has been swapped out to fit what Nintendo clearly thinks of as ""Mature"" gaming mechanics. Instead of having a sword and shield you can upgrade you now have a plethora of weapons to loot off enemies which break after a very short usage... It's like being punished for playing the game. Even the Master Sword breaks.
Link runs along with a stamina bar like he did in Skyward Sword. In fact he plays much like the Link in Skyward Sword except he's now in a world 800x the size meaning he is unbearably slow. Like snail dragging in quick sand kind of slow. The world is massive and you want to be able to scale every mountain, which you are forced to do at an unbelievably slow pace. The world also is not fun to explore. It's pretty to explore, but there is nothing to do that is actually fun because fighting, traveling, and item usage are all boring.

+ Graphics:
Amazing. It's beautiful and there are no load times for anything. However there is a constant stutter and frame rate whenever you're around moving objects... Like grass. Grass is everywhere, by the way. So the game almost feels like a Sega Saturn game and the disc is skipping. Again, HOW can you give a game a perfect score when it just IS NOT PERFECT!?

- Sound:
The absolute worst feature of the game. Did they even make a score to this game? There seems to be a slight patter of piano in the distance behind you which plays softly among the never ending clatter of your weapon hitting your shield. The painful sound of Link walking is only comparable to water boarding. They added voice actors which is cool except the American actors sound extremely cheesy and amateur and there is no switching to Japanese voice acting, which if you've seen the Japanese trailer you know is amazing. And if you thought the sound effect of having one heart remaining in previous Zeldas was bad it's nothing compared to the sound effect of when you're near a shrine. Which is all the time.

- Overall
Speaking of shrines, there are no longer dungeons. There are shrines. 100's of them and they all have the same skin and are kind of like one puzzle you would find in a typical Zelda dungeon. You have to solve 4 of them, and then go to a goddess statue to have her give you more stamina or a heart container. YEP, there are NO heart pieces in this game! However there is an endless supply of food, materials, bugs, animals to kill, and a bunch of other things that the Zelda world did not need. There are 4 bigger shrines which are all very similar and probably the best part of the game.
In general this game is just a giant middle finger to anyone who loves Nintendo and specifically the Zelda franchise. I'm convinced these perfect score reviews are all hired interns with Nintendo to ensure their stock doesn't plummet farther than it already has. And I hate saying this about Nintendo, I honestly LOVE NINTENDO. Sadly, these reviews mean the Zelda franchise will keep these horrendous changes, so thanks to all of you who made it impossible for us to ever have another Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker!!!",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheWinner,03-03-2017,"Be wary of people giving this game a high score. They just might be trying to sell you on something.

Things it did right:
+ Huge world with lots of little details, probably where Nintendo spent most of their time in development
+ The go-anywhere-and-possibly-be-undergeared motif of LoZ1 was translated to a 3D game alright enough
+ Made the mastersword rely on heart containers to acquire it, much like the White Sword or Magical Sword from LoZ1. Probably the only specific callback to LoZ1 that translated ""perfectly"".

Things it tried:
• Redesigned many characters, going as far as never giving Link a hat in promotional art and changing his iconic color from green to blue, or Ganon who is now a demon spider instead of a pig, only a pig in spirit. Moblins were turned into weird long snouted lanky unicorn pigmonsters, Hinox were turned into somewhat-more-generic Giants losing their iconic(?) Bomb-throwing attacks.
• Tried voice acting but traded player-freedom of naming their character so spoken lines could needlessly refer to you as ""Link"".
• The go-anywhere-model of LoZ1 lost almost all likeness to most other Zelda games because of the way it was implemented. In order to go anywhere and do anything from the start of the game, the player unfortunately gets all their tools at the start of the game so no proper dungeons with proper treasures or item equipment that would otherwise lock one player from accessing things another player could gated via game progress- which also isn't necessarily even ""true"" to how LoZ1 accomplished it.

Things it did wrong:
- Traded the sweeping and catchy good music of traditional Zelda design even going as far back as the original LoZ1 for lighter, emptier, less-frequent ambient sounds to adapt to the world's environment of ""musical"" cues and reliance on things like stealth. As an original game this might have worked, but the tradeoff meaning no great ""Zelda music"" as many expect from the franchise doesn't work to a benefit. The weaker audio design fits their game design, but the weaker audio design of their game design doesn't fit ""Zelda"".
- From a series known for streamlined access to health replenishment via bottles full of potions and frequent floating hearts, placing all healing behind food collection and menu access gets in the way of player intention within the world and only serves to distract the player or otherwise pad the adventure with unnecessary filler. Trivial for a series that virtually invented the concept behind the Estus Flask from the Souls games. Such an estus-flask-like method of healing would have more accurately emulated the streamlined healing of past Zelda games while still allowing them to get away from hearts in bushes and pots.
- Related to food collection, the game design around killing simple non-zelda scenery animals unrelated to the variety of Zelda enemies for various Raw Meat items is woefully unnecessary and out-of-place for any Zelda game much less any Nintendo game. This concept was so poorly implemented to even include killing foxes and wolves for meat, in our modern society where both have been domesticated as pets or otherwise crossbred with domestic dogs to produce canines that look identical to their wild counterparts. Whether the player has the intent or not to harm them, they can be killed by enemies anyway. ""Eating dog meat"" is a gut-wrenching phrase I never imagined would describe an action in any videogame much less one from Nintendo, and has forever irreparably damaged my otherwise flawless opinion of the franchise and its creators.
- No actual sprawling dungeons from a series known for it's sprawling dungeons is a weakpoint. The shrines, although numerous and fairly uniquely designed in terms of their puzzles, unfortunately still manage to all look identical and don't offer the same expected gameplay layout or scenic/regional design as cohesive interconnected hallways and rooms from traditional dungeons in other Zelda games. Even the four Divine Beasts operate more like ""slightly larger shrines"" than something remotely close to being considered a true ""dungeon"", with Hyrule Castle being the only ""true"" dungeon.
- Enemy variety compared to past Zelda games and even many modern games is staggeringly low. All enemies and bosses counted, there are only 23 different monsters that are copied-pasted-and-recolored or given a slightly different weapon or elemental attribute to create the majority of Breath of the Wild's ""variety"". Even going back to Ocarina of Time, there were 46 unique enemies and bosses counted together, not including recolored or reskinned variations; and of course each mainline Zelda game since Ocarina and before Breath of the Wild has had virtually the same variety if not more. There are actually more background scenery animal species in this game than unique enemies, meaning the only true visual variety that exists is in the scenery itself - a negative only because enemy combat is a necessity.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Merahoraeus,05-03-2017,"Not the worst Zelda game I've ever played, but undeniably the most disappointing one to date. This game was severely overhyped, and for all the praising of the ""boundless world"" (as someone who grew up playing classic MMORPG's like WoW, I'm not impressed by this world size), the game suffers from serious crippling flaws. From the very moment they announced that weapons would break within the game, I knew this game was going to be overly convoluted with the survival mechanics, and lo and behold! -- these are the most convoluted survival mechanics I've ever experienced in any game, and I am beyond disappointed that it had to be in a Zelda game.

I thought I hated Skyward Sword because of the breakable shields and the stamina gauge, but Breath of the Wild plunges it to a whole new level of absolute loathing. Oh, and apparently the Hylian Shield can break according to some players, but it's still the best shield and easier to get than in Skyward Sword. That, however, is no consolation for all of the other excruciating survival mechanics, like the stamina wheel. Link can't swim. Okay, he can swim until his stamina wheel runs out, and then he drowns. I can tread water and float for over an hour before getting tired, and Link is considerably more fit than I am, and he can't even swim for more than a minute before just drowning. Here I thought the point of immersion was to be, well, immersive, but that couldn't be farther from immersive (it's more of submersion, really).

Then there's lighting... Eiji Aonuma evidently assumed that because metal conducts electricity, that lightning would be attracted to random metal objects -- I think he needs to consult a middle school physics teacher. The ELECTRONS in the clouds and the ground are attracted to each other via an electrical field, and the resulting attraction between these electrons is lightning, and lightning will channel through the tallest object within the electrical field to make that connection -- whether it conducts electricity or not. This is why lightning strikes trees and skyscrapers need lightning rods.

However, the biggest and most infuriating disappointment is the cooldown on the Master Sword. Yes, the Master Sword has a cooldown. You can use it for so long before it needs to ""recharge"" for 10 minutes. That was my one hope, that the Master Sword would be a permanent, unbreakable, no-conditions-attached, weapon, and it isn't. The Master Sword isn't even the strongest weapon, it only has a base damage of 30 and gets boosted to 60 only in Hyrule Castle. Also, what was with that bit about it being rusted? Never explained, and the narrative only serves to leave more questions.

The story... Instead of having a good story, driven by compelling characters and a sequential plot, like Skyward Sword, the players must take Link to random places in Hyrule to flashback memories from his time with Zelda, and that's the narrative. Very, very underwhelming. You don't get to interact with these characters. You just get to watch them do things in the past very briefly, and accessing these memories is incredibly hard, and it's very difficult to try and do them in sequential order. The narrative would have been far better if the player had actually interacted in these scenarios -- not flashbacks.

As I said, this isn't the worst Zelda game, but it is the most disappointing, and I can only pray that Eiji Aonuma learns from his serious mistakes. After this, I'm not sure I want him working on another Zelda title, ever again.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Thruck197,06-03-2017,"90% of people will never replay breath of the wild.
The game is designed around dumping all your time into a single play file thanks to how slow the accumulation of anything works. Theres no second quest, the enemy variety is **** like the only thing you have going for it is ""the world is big and i wanna see every inch of it"" which is absolutely no different than any other open world game ever. Unfortunately the gameplay options and variety isn't there to carry you all the way.

Its Minecraft survival without crafting, world building, world destruction, or a random world and fresh world every time you play. And I don't even like Minecraft, i'm just sayin this Hyrule is going to get old fast because the world itself is the only thing that got a lot of attention in development. There are re-used assets everywhere, from multiple recolored/reskinned variations of enemies to even there functionally being 6 or 7 different kinds of weapons in the game that were negligently forced into strict attack sets of shortsword, longsword or spear. Reused animations, reused monsters, reused assets everywhere. Even the mastersword explodes into blue dust like every other destructable weapon despite its plot mechanic of ""running out of energy"" to be returned to your inventory rendered useless for 20 minutes.

The shrines work well at adding a hook and I've been surprised they haven't gotten too dull. I am hoping the frame rate can be improved with a patch because it can chug at times.

Much like the newest Metal Gear, or FFXV, this will get great reviews at first, and when people really play it the truth will be known. Everyone loved the Star Wars Prequels, until they didn't. Terrible voice acting as well, shouldn't have even bothered for the cutscenes. i was bored of this after only a few hours.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dead-Pixel,07-03-2017,"This game runs like trash on both Wii U and Switch. It's 2017 and having a 30fps game is bad enough, but when the frames routinely drop below 20 you have a serious problem. This is all despite the fact that the visuals are already incredibly simplistic and look like they could easily be from a game released in 2006. It's pretty amazing that Nintendo refuses to join up with modern technology.

This game is basically Skyrim-lite. There are very few outfits/armor to collect, leading you to running around a world and visiting shrines fruitlessly. It's fun at first but fatigue and repetition set in quickly once you realize the only reason to continue grinding shrines is to get an upgrade to health or stamina. That's it, there's no skills to level, or other perks. Just those two. Character customization depth goes out the window.

What's worse is Nintendo decided to lock several iconic armor sets behind Amiibo microtransaction paywalls. Even though they are in the game you can't unlock them unless you go out and buy several $10-$30 toys, assuming you can even find them. Companies like Capcom get torn apart for egregious locked-out content like this, yet Nintendo once again gets a free pass, because Zelda apparently.

Your horse Epona and Wolf link are also locked behind Amiibo figures. Good luck getting those without spending money on toys.

These 10/10 reviews are laughable and truly show just how much credibility all these ""journalists"" have. They should be critiquing a game without bias. There's no way this game is close to being perfect, and if it wasn't a Zelda game it would have a MUCH lower score. Journalists should be reliable for an objective review and critique of a game and instead they let their own fandom get in the way of being honest with their readers.

Swamrz,07-04-2017,"After finishing the new Zelda, a game that I've been waiting for so long, my feelings about it are mixed.
I guess one could call it: ""Bittersweet symphony"".
It's undoubtedly extremely artistic and beautiful, with very nice new additions and a great looking vast world, hidden with all types of wonders. The weather effects are extremely atmospheric and voice additions are great.
However, I found its main scenario short and flat. Many of the old mechanics (temples, farming, mystery items and classic small details) are missing and the silence of their absence to an old school hardcore Zelda fan like me is deafening.
I am generally very light and forgiving with technical details and graphics, but either the game or the console itself has serious technical issues at some points, which leaves me wondering: ""how on earth did those 'game bricks' went through the quality assurance process?"". I will not talk about areas where the framerate drops to 10-15 per sec, because I forgive it, with a light heart. Were they in such a big rush to push the game out? We waited 3 more years for it, a few more months wouldn't have made any difference.
The music is generally not noticeable. With the exceptions of some big moments. But nothing to be carved in your memory like the old Zelda game
I'm sorry but, if I have to compare it with its own predecessors, like the ocarina of time, wind waker, twilight princess, this new installment will not do. It has been measured... and found wanting.

The frame rate drops to staggering levels very often. The overall color of the game and environment is pale and there is lots of glare.

The final boss and ending were disappointing. There was no dialogue-- both Link and Gannon were mute. The final form of Gannon, when defeated, did not explode after an animation build up . Symbolic to an anticlimactic ending, the defeated Gannon merely vanished and faded. This felt conflicting and inadequate.",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
zeroex_15,03-03-2017,"Not worthy of the Zelda franchise.

Despite offering a huge world to explore its largely empty and devoid of interest. The shrines are mini puzzles and become incredibly boring early with journeying between them even more so. Its also one of the only ways to increase your hearts/stamina so your essentially forced to do these side quests.

Dungeons are gone. You have shrines that are very short puzzles rewarding an item you can trade for hearts or stamina. Probably is they all look the same with bland interiors. There are 4 mechanical creatures that are slightly longer versions of shrines but the only real dungeon is hyrule castle.

Its also annoying that the inventory is micro management heavy, item break often so your constantly swapping. You can expand your inventory but again it involves finding seeds and trading them in. If the world was more interesting this might have been fun.

The climbing mechanic isn't fun. Its tedious and repetitive. The towers you have to climb are essentially less interesting versions of the towers from far cry 4.

To quote a famous metacritic user. ""Zelda has been died for years it was almost died when I was 6 and right now I am 10""(BryanM.) In recent years people have been hyping the return of the dying Zelda franchise. with recent release of this game many calling this best game of all time. i am here to give my opinion.

if this game released maybe 10 years ago than possibly could be considered decent. but now with rising popularity of modern open world games this feels outdated. menus pathetically clunky and slow , frame rate drops at levels worse than sonic 06, gameplay the same as previous titles in series. the hole game is outdated. probably because of the multiyear delays that have effected this titles release.

for example,, in modern openworld games like minecraft menus are quite easy to navegate around. in games like fallout 4 gameplay is deep and varied, and skyrim has very content filled world.

- feels like zelda.
- the old guys beard looks cool.
- overworld is big (can be considered a negative thing)
Thats pretty much it....

- overworld is empty
- plot is barebones generic
-graphics are ps2 quality.
-puzzles are simple and bland

Nedkelly,04-03-2017,"The game is really basic and underwhelming from what you would expect from 2017 game for 50 pounds.
Sure there are some nice features, some interesting spells as well, but that is not really a game changing aspects of it. Sure you we could ride a horses, and the horses are really nice made, but eh you guess it, other games also have nice made horses...
The world is huge, too bad its empty, and stuff renders really close to us, fog is also annoying and almost taking all the joy from the open world. There are also really few dungeons to play in, and almost all of them have the same bosses.
As that being said, there are really few enemies you fight against, most of them are just recolors, the AI of the enemies is non existent, sometimes they could kill themselves when fighting on a hills...
The animations are really hard to describe, sometimes they are as smooth as a silk sheet on the other time are clunky as hell and characters teleport their limbs around, this feels really weird. The amount of fighting moves is not high either.
Graphics are the graphics you would expect from the free MMORPG game, not from high price stuff like this. Even though the graphics arent really exclusive, the game could have significant fps drops, sometimes even stutter when fighting many enemies at once, this is unacceptable for the price of the game as high as 50 pounds. Is this game in alpha stage? Because i cant tell, the game feels unfinished for me.
My score is 2, the game doesnt deserve more, simply because it is stuck in time somewhere between 2009 and 2010, for the price like this you would expect something much more. Why would you play underdog Wii u, when you could play something much more advanced for the same or similar price???
Both console and the game are not worth their price, i regret all pennies i spend on this, would have buy some league of legends skins instead...",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

jameswh,05-03-2017,"One thing we've all learned today. No matter how ""respectible"" a gaming website/magazine claims to be they all swoon and crumble over that unmerited, nostalgia-blighted, might of Nintendo. Zelda is a by-the-numbers RPG, nothing new, nothing special. Its quests are simple and dull, the story is average 90's kiddy Nintendo rubbish. Combat feels realy old. This is not modern, not new, its for people trapped in a 90's/2000's time-warp. This is 2017 ffs! I've been gaming since the micro computers of the 80's and I can tell you that this is definitely money for old rope. Now, did Nintendo buy good reviews? Probably not. But there are other ways to ensure great reviews than buying them (like Bathesda holding back future review copies to some websites?) Be nice or you'll miss out.... something's definitely amiss with all these ""masterpiece"" reviews. This game isn't a masterpiece. Its just another open world RPG... yes, yet another.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Pesto,03-03-2017,"I was really looking forward the next Zelda game, but after 15 hours i can't play anymore.
The game is a boring average of every open world game released in the past five years (Far Cry, MGSV, ASC)
I found no unique or especially fun features that would make me want to keep coming back, you have done everything in this game a hundred times before in other games and BOTW does not keep them exciting.
The combat is very repetitive you can use these gimmicky ways to dispatch random groups of enemies but there is really no point and it gets old very fast. The story is ok, for a game that wants to take zelda in a new direction though it was very similar to every other game in the series. There is a little meat in the dungeons but they alone won't take you very long. The English voice acting sounds off and out of place, but the Japanese dub is supposed to sound tolerable, the music overall is decent but goes for mostly atmospheric music, there are no new themes that get stuck in your head. Graphically the game is poor, i can't be amazed at the ""beauty"" of the world if the world is only being rendered for 10 metres, there were many times where the game would freeze for a second or two in intense combat situations and i am not really a fan of the cell shaded style, but i suppose Nintendo really had no choice working off a hideously under-powered system as ever.
So overall i would not recommend to Zelda fans, maybe to people who buy games just for open world but not me. after buying every other game in the Zelda series, i am upset that they have ruined my favorite game series, this game had real potential but just isn't fun.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The pace of the game is suuuuper slow. It totally lacks all the great music and atmosphere of other Zelda Games (like my favorite: Ocarina of time).
Graphics is a matter of liking, but too me it is Nintendo 64 on steroids, but sure nothing i expect in 2017.
All in all it is a game for those always living in the past and therefor like Retro Games. I live today and tomorrow and surely do not enjoy this Zelda at all.
Just hope my Switch gets some great Games soon.
This open world thing never helps to tel a good story in a decent pace. Wrong choice for this Game in my opinion. If you like it, good for you.

BLK99,18-04-2017,"Este no es el mejor juego en el momento, tiene un enfoque divertido no lo niego, algunas armaduras me parecen muy bonitas, y los graficos no son punteros pero son agradables, algunas mecanicas aqui y haya, los giños a otros juegos de la entrega y una cantidad de actividades accesorias que alimentan la experiencia, son bien recibidas. El combate siendo sincero no, no es lo mejor del juego ni remotamente, es de lo mas basico y tedioso, aqui si es donde destaca que es un juego para niños pequeños, claro que existira gente que le despierte nostalgia y es totalmente comprensible, pero que solo por eso deba tener una calificacion perfecta, es ser poco objetivo.

El juego es interesante y divertido pero es para el nene de la casa, bueno y para el coleccionista que crecio con nintendo pero el concepto se ha desarrollado muchas veces y de mejores maneras, la historia de un the witcher, la exploracion de un assasins creed, el espectaculo de un Uncharted, el combate de Nioh, o el realismo de un tomb raider en modo de supervivencia aquellos son juegos que han marcado un antes y un despues. Este es un juego lindo, con mecanicas variadas, pero es todo. Si eres un jugador experimentado y buscas un reto, este juego no es para ti, si al contrario eres un niño pequeño, o guardas un buen recuerdo de nintendo supongo, aunque mi recomendacion es que comprar la consola por un solo juego, con los precios que tiene y la experiencia que ofrece la consola, no es lo ideal, es mejor esperar a que este todo mas barato.

Aunque quisiera agregar que el juego ofrece una gran cantidad de contenido en actividades, y es interesante el enfoque que tiene en abordar el mundo abierto, al darle al jugador la libertad, para que explore y lleve la historia como le parezca, o trate de crear una propia parcialmente que es el punto mas fuerte para mi de todo el juego,

lo que sigue no tiene que ver estricatamente con la review si no es un comentario que me gustaria realizar acerca de los mundos abiertos.

El the Witcher fue un juego increible, pero una vez termine la historia principal y los DLCs no volvi a entrar precisamente por que no habia nada mas que hacer o descubrir despues de llegar al maximo nivel, los combates ya no me parecian un reto, considero que hay muchos mundos abiertos, que estan bien elaborados y tienen unas mecanicas solidas, y no me parece que hacer varias entregas de un juego sea la respuesta, si no que hacer un juego principal y alimentarlo periodicamente y siendo sincero prefiero pagar un dlc con una buena cantida de contenido de un juego que me gusta que por un juego nuevo incompleto o repetitivo.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

skilly225,03-03-2017,"I am submitting my third review of this after nearly 14 hours of gameplay, and have decided to change my vote again to a zero, and I will explain.

This game in enthralling to begin, the idea of link in an open world is amazing, but it does get a little bit inconsequential after you get the glider, and outside of purposefully looking for little hidden things (that arent that hidden) I dont really find much of a use in travelling the vast plains or exploring the nooks and crannies of a valley. It's a lot of looting small things of value and killing easy enemies.

I dont want to spoil much else, and there are some slightly new and cool mechanics to be found. These, however, dont touch the other issues.

The FPS drops are massive. And I mean massive.

Que no os engañen, este juego innova sino nada, poco. Eso sumado a las expectativas que tenemos todos al jugarlo de un SEÑOR ZELDA, me llevan a ponerle un 4 de nota. Sin duda un fracaso que Nintendo deberia de haber sabido hace tiempo. Los combates son repetitivos, te terminas aburriendo de andar, la energia te falta por todos los lados. En definitiva, un juego repetitivo sin muchos puntos fuertes.

Muy cegado hay que estar por los sentimientos que casi todos tenemos a esta saga para considerar esto como un juego bueno, o peor aun, como una obra maestra. Ni el soundtrack se salva.

El rendimiento por otra parte, es pobre, muy pobre, sacar una consola hecha practicamente para este juego y que no pueda aguantar 30fps a 1080p (cuando lo normal seria 60fps en estos juegos tan poco cargados de realismo)... Simplemente decepcionante.

Do they think I have all day? I don't, and I'm not about to waste what little free time I have on watching this slow character plod about in a way that only serves to artificially extend the games length.

It's also really hard to be immersed in the Zelda universe when he can climb up completely flat surfaces by grabbing non-existent hand holds. It's gotten so bad I actually have to pretend to grab the rougher bricks and act as if I will fall if I grab the flat surfaces.

Helixhammer,21-03-2017,"Maybe I'm being picky or maybe I'm just failing to embrace the change but my main excitement on past Zelda games was entering a new dungeon to explore, completing puzzles, unlocking a new skill/weapon along the way, to ultimately find a mini boss waiting to challenge you before moving on to the dungeons main boss where you use your new weapon/skill to kill them, the formula was simple and I loved it. However I feel somewhat cheated with BOTW, don't get me wrong BOTW does not fail to impress but I feel like it left the true Zelda fan in me a little disappointed.

The dungeon formula has been replaced by hundreds of shrines which are great fun, but feel a little lacking, most are scattered with chests filled with nothing more than rupees or mediocre weapons which will break after a few battles or I already have something better and none have any kind of challenging boss or enemy's so there is nothing substantial to actually completing them other than to improve your health and stamina meter which obviously helps but it doesn't feel entertaining because of this, The guardians you take back are a little closer to what I expect but I had all of them completed in less than a couple of hours and there are only four of them, again no real challenge and an end boss of no real importance or difficulty, the format for these is essentially the same across, shot, slash, repeat.

My main entertainment came in walking around and actually spending countless hours exploring the land, since this is such an open world you can go almost anywhere and explore anything, the content seemed great as it didn't feel empty in any way and I always found something interesting but I feel like I always come back to a lack of main content, there is so much stuff on the side going on to keep the world feeling alive but lacks the main stuff that made Zelda format so fun. Rewards for side quests and exploring usually come in the form of rupees or something equally boring so I tend to forget why I bother with some of it.

Finally my last gripe comes in the form of the horse, I never once used one because they are simply frustrating to use or they are never there when I need them, you can whistle for them but if they are always out of range and don't hear it, one point for realism but what use is that if I need to travel quick? I ultimately end up running across the landscape without my trusty steed and then rely heavily on shines for teleport points, rendering the horse pointless but guess that's a preference.

Ultimately what I am trying to say is there isn't a huge amount wrong with this game in reality, but it lacks in what I expect in a Zelda game, it's sucked away countless hours and I have very minor and nit picky gripes but for a true Zelda fan especially one that expects a more traditional format this will leave you a little disappointed. gone are the days of the hookshot, ironboots and mirror shields, I do miss it and I will go back to others in the series to get my fix but BOTW is here to stay. Get ready for a bright and colorful adventure filled with interesting characters, puzzles and lore, but the clever boss battles, weapons/equipment and dungeons are gone :(",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
likevin96,23-06-2017,"Completion: 100% Dungeons, 100% Memories, 79% Shrines, True Ending

Pros:
- The open world is truly free. Climbing in this game is one of the most enjoyable mechanics I have ever experienced. Exploration is rewarding and genuinely surprising. The upgrades dovetail perfectly with these factors, creating a gameplay loop that doesn't let up and continues to be exhilarating. The freedom to truly go anywhere never gets old. This is, without a doubt, the greatest open world game I have ever played.
- The dungeons are a blast despite being on the short side.
- Only game I have played that does weapon durability right. The entire battle system is centered around this mechanic and thus it feels organic to switch in and out of your arsenal.
- Shrines are fun and inventive. There are a few that truly push you to the limits of your abilities.
- Measured and impactful economy that makes every resource count.
- Beautiful art style that impresses despite technical limitations.

Cons:
- The late game becomes a bit of a grind. Acquiring more materials can be tedious, combat becomes unnecessary, and rewards no longer invite excitement.
- English voice acting is not great. Most egregiously, Zelda's VA simply does not match her character
- The story lacked impact and by its very nature felt disjointed. I was unable to develop a significant emotional connection to any of the characters.
- It rains WAY WAY too much. Incredibly annoying mechanic that will occasionally halt progress and gameplay entirely.
- Bosses are uncreative and the same tricks will generally work on every single enemy in the game
- Significant and noticeable frame rate dips. Although this was patched, occasional issues persist.

I played this game for over 70 hours and I was not bored for a moment of it. That's the highest praise I can offer for any title.

If Breath Of The Wild was the only game for Switch, it would justify the price of the console ten times over.

I finally defeated Ganon last night, but still have so much to do, I think I will get a huge amount of replayability out of it. The only reason I'm giving a score of 9/10 is because of the framerate issue on Switch, but I'm sure this will be fixed in a future patch.

EAPyoutube,24-03-2017,"This game, THIS GAME right here is probably the main reason why I still have hope for 3D Zelda games. Nintendo have truly done it this time when reinventing the wheel. Everything from the inventory system to the controls, to the environment and the characters, this is an experience worth playing. Never have I sunk my teeth so far into an open world game. Everything around Link feels alive, and better yet unlike other open world games, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is ACTUALLY FUN. The anime art style is also not obnoxious here unlike JRPGs from other developers, or the Fire Emblem series.

Obviously this game is going to have a flaw here and there. My only issue with this game is the rainfall, especially when I have to climb to an important area or somewhere that I know has a secret, which I won't spoil for one certain mountain in the game.

No matter if it's the Wii U or Switch you own, Breath of the Wild is a must have. I recommend everyone try it, even those new to Zelda or those who don't like RPGs that much. This is truly Game of the Century.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Definitely the best Zelda. It is more similar to the very first Zelda game in terms of being dropped into a massive world with no hand holding. It breaks away from traditional Zelda style, but manages to do so without ruining the core Zelda experience. Aside from all that, it is the best open-world game I've ever played.

doctuar,22-06-2017,"A great Zelda game, but I'm not sure if it's the best. There is no doubt that the world is amazing and fun to explore but there's a strange lack of purpose to it. I've done all 120 shrines now and seen a fair bit of the game, though there is sometimes a lot of busywork involved (especially when upgrading armour or certain side-quests). I can't bring myself to give this game a 10 but I think an 8 would also be unfair. Honestly, I think it's a good game but as a Zelda entry... Ocarina of Time still wins the top slot for me.

Check it out if you like open world games and action adventure, there's an awful lot to see and do.

lolingAround,23-06-2017,"A lot of the positive aspects have been thoroughly discussed. It's a big, beautiful world. The game gives you a ton of freedom to explore and play at your leisure. There is an abundance of shrines, most of which I enjoyed completing. I loved doing the dungeons. I like the combat; flurry rushes and shield parrying are satisfying. I loved the rune powers, especially magnesis and stasis. I'm not gonna talk too much more about the positives, because there are plenty of positive reviews to be found on the Internet.

I have two major complaints that really keep this game from being even better. First, the enemy variety is abysmal, considering how big the map is. This almost ruins combat. I like the fighting mechanic, but it sucks fighting the same Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos constantly. The skeletal enemies that appear constantly at night will drive you crazy. I was very disappointed to find out that there were no Darknuts, Ironknucles, Deku Babas, Redeads, Gibdos, Armos, etc. Even the overworld mini-bosses lack in variety, as there are about 100 of them to fight, but only 4 major types. This shortcoming is a big missed opportunity to encourage exploration. The second complaint - and this is the biggest of them all - is the bear bone main campaign. There's nothing to it other than the Divine Beasts and some memories, which are basically just cut scenes that show events that's already happened. I loved the Divine Beasts, but they were too short and small, not to mention the incredibly dumb choice they made to make them look and feel too similar to each other. The developers focused way too much on making a large, pretty overworld map and neglected the main story. I'm hoping the upcoming DLC alleviates some of these problems.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
YourMediaSucks,25-06-2017,"Amazing game! One of my favorites in the series. Stunning visuals. Combat is a lot of fun and presents many creative ways to defeat enemies. Starts out pretty hard with very little health and garbage weapons. that sounds negative, but I liked this a lot and definitely prefer the early game over the end game. Once you find some good weapons and armor, upgrade your health, and stockpile healing items, Link becomes pretty OP. This makes the combat a little tedious later on in the game. Not a perfect story, but I liked the acquiring of old memories and the piecing together of Link's old life. Dungeons were lackluster and boss fights were too easy. Side quests had a lot of charm and there are a lot of quirky loveable characters this time around. The sense of freedom and exploration is amazing. This is definitely a must-have for Switch/Wii U owners and a strong recommendation for any gamer.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ravenned,03-07-2017,"I'd give this a 7-8. This is a very well made game. The graphics, style, atmosphere, even the BGM are great. They create an immersive world that is a joy to be in. The world map is huge, and there seem to be many things to do in the game... except that there aren't many at all!
That's my gripe about the game. The huge map, coupled with the lack of hand holding (you'll be spending a lot of time figuring what to do next), creates the illusion that there are many things to do. But what you'll be doing most is map exploration. That could be a very boring task, depending on who you are, given your extremely slow travelling speed. The beautifully crafted world makes it a little more interesting, but that can only go so far.
Then there are the quests, that feel repetitive, because you aren't emotionally invested in the poorly driven storyline and weak characters. The plot is well written, but because so much of the game is 'exploration', the plot seems to fade away. Link, the main character, doesn't say a word throughout the game. It is seriously difficult to invest yourself into a character like that. Ganon, the main antagonist, appears rarely throughout the game, says nothing, and you know nothing of why it's even the antagonist. Poor character development, and these are the main characters we're talking about here.
Then all we're left with is a beautiful game world. Sure, it's well made. But it could take you DAYS to fully discover it. I'll bet that you'll get sick of exploration before you even finish travelling the game world.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Stlouzilla,21-06-2017,"A perfect score still doesn't even do Zelda: BotW justice. BotW is magical, endearing, ground breaking, powerful, and simply a joy to play. Nintendo's ability to reinvent the LoZ franchise, while simultaneously improving the open world genre so substantially, crafts a masterpiece that stands alongside the best games of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
PurpleEvya,22-08-2017,"A lot of people got really mad when they started playing Zelda BotW because they wanted a different game. they wanted skyrim or zelda OoT or some other game that you might think is like BotW but in reality it's a completely different game.
and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

I would say BotW is: skyrim with the flavor of zelda and the magic of Nintendo.

so what does that mean?

Well I will first tell you what BotW IS NOT.

It is not your regular linear zelda experience, there are no epic dungeons, no traditional items in said dungeons to hoard on your little pouch, no traditional epic boss battles, no companions (thank god), no empty hyrule field (but we do get some emptiness to ride through with our horses), and no story given to you at every single point. because this is NOT a typical zelda.

it is not skyrim, BotW is NOT your typical RPG, there is no leveling up, voice acting are scarce and the graphics are not supposed to be hyper-realistic! nor fantastic... or even good. (although I really liked the art style).

And no matter what you think, even if everybody says that: IT IS NOT A PERFECT GAME.

now that we said that let me tell you what Zelda Breath of the WIld is: zelda flavored open world game with Nintendo Magic at it's core.

it's a good open world game in the zelda universe (that makes it great) and was made by NINTENDO so you know it's at least good (but honestly if you'll play it with no expectations you'll see it's almost perfect).

And I would like to end with a list of things you and everyone else should know about this game:
1. I saw someone who said rain ruined the game because you can't climb, to that person I say: yeah because they want to encourage you to try walking in a road and not to take shortcuts all the time! and because it creates nice problems you'll need to solve.

2. people who complained about dungeon size: first go watch this:https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLc38fcMFcV_ul4D6OChdWhsNsYY3NA5B2.
now let me ask you this: what do you want from a dungeon? is it puzzles? cause you got shrines for that (and awesome puzzles in the dungeon), is it epic boss battles? HAVE you tried to defeat a lynel? or a hinox? or a huge rock monster? or the Molduga? or a guardian? because those are pretty epic battles, and do you remember how it is like to enter a divine beast for the first time?? EPIC. it is always EPIC. or maybe you're looking for items? well excuuuseee me princess that the tens of weapons and shields that you'll use in the game are not enough for you! but perhaps you're looking for the atmosphere? well then here's a tip: just walk around hyrule and it's different regions, from desert and mountains, to sea and rivers there is much to explore and experience that atmosphere really shouldn't be your concern.

3. people who say that weapons shouldn't break, but than you'll never use any weapon but the one with the highest number, meaning you wouldn't experience even a quarter of the many weapons they worked so hard to make! meaning that if the weapons were unbreakable you would probably get only 3 different weapons to choose from... and where's the fun in that?

4. peopla who say this game has a higher number then it deserves: shut up, if people decide this game is 10/10 and you decide it's 7/10 you should give a rating of 7/10 not 0/10 just so the overall points will go down to seven... because the whole point of the overall points is to show what the everyone thinks about the game, not just you.

5. people who say Nintendo pays critics to give BotW 10/10, first of all it's not funny stop saying that, second of all I do admit critics has this habit of giving zelda games a really high score.
and at some point one would ask him/herself how is this possible? but shouting false claims just because you're upset the general public disagree with your opinion is not ok.
in fact I think it's sad you don't think your opinion is enough, and you have to lie and say other people agree with you in hope someone will agree with you.

in the end Zelda Breath Of The WIld got a lot of over-reactions, both positive and negative. but overall it's one of the best open world games I have ever played (probably the best).
and from now on I think I can safely say that it's my favourite game. :)",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AventadorWesley,22-06-2017,"After playing Skyward Sword is Breath of the Wild a wind of fresh air to the series. Breath of the Wild takes the series back to it's NES root. This is a welcome change in a gaming era where almost everything is linear.

The Gameplay
In the beginning of the game you get every ability to use in the open word that is Hyrule. And after the beginning hour of the game you can explore everything. When I got to this point I followed the story marker but when I played through the game the second time I decided to jump of the south era and I had a almost completely diffrent experience then the first time.The only thing that I have trouble is the clumsy inventory that you have to drop weapons or shields before you can pick it up because your inventory is to small. There is an option to expand it but it is still annoying. That is just a small portion of the freedom that this game has to offer it is simply amazing and very fun to play.
9/10

Style
The graphics are not of PS4 or XBONE levels but the details of the world make up for it. For example if you shoot an arrow in to the sky, and follow the path of the arrow you can pick it up again. Or when it rains you can climb slower or even fall of! The soundtrack is also a bit disappointing and missing the classic Zelda tunes you expect from other Zelda games.
9/10

In conclusion Breath of the Wild is a spectacular, game that gives you freedom like no other game before it. But the small problems keep it back from ""The greatest game of all time""
So I give it a 9/10.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Cool8t,22-06-2017,"One of the best Action RPG experience I have ever played. The Open World leads to so much freedom and exploration - and the game never holds your hand - unlike previous installments. The Side Quests themselves were okay but obviously weren't the focus of the game - just the ability to choose to follow them was enough for me. I probably did 10% of the text based Side Quests but I enjoyed the many optional enemy encounters , minigames, and the one photography based quest. The dungeons were great, boss battles even better, and the temples got the same itch of the dungeons in a smaller size. Overall I found the first 50 hours of the game to be a top 3 gaming experience of mine and would recommend many more hours for any gaming completionist out there",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Diatom,23-06-2017,"The is honestly my favorite game as of now. This game alone was enough for me to return to console (and Nintendo no less) and am overall incredibly impressed. The story-now that I have observed every detail of said narrative-is incredibly dark and fascinating and delivered the narrative in a rather nuanced manner. For example, (potential spoiler btw) finishing Kass' quests unlocks a hidden conversation in which Kass reveals that Zelda loves Link and tells Link that he knows who he is. Given that most NPC's do not recognize who you really are, the impact of Kass recognizing you is compounded in terms of effect. Subtle details about the way the story is told like the one mentioned is what makes it rather intriguing. If I had any real criticism about this game, however, it would be that the final stage of Ganon could have been made a bigger challenge (although, it does make sense that Ganon is the way he is from a story perspective). Despite that, the sheer scale and freedom offered by the game more than makes up for it. I have beaten the game twice and now eagerly await the DLC.

sidenote: all the fanboys that left critical reviews for this game without even playing the game are...embarrassingly thickheaded (let's keep things civil ;) ).

HonestReviewerx,26-06-2017,"Perfect game, trust me when i say that you will want to pick up this game. It's a fun experience to go around the different landscapes in the game seeing new enemies and new conditions to going through those landscapes. Anyone who gave this a lower score than 8 is having some personal issues with the game or the company behind it going beyond what the game is actually about. The only issue like other people have said is the weapon breaking. I personally didn't mind it since you get so many new weapons anyway, but i suppose it would have been nice if you had a replace weapon smart-button. People say the world is empty, well to those people i can only say that you must have bought the wrong game because this world is far from empty, there are endless things to do and collect, and the best part is even walking through the landscapes and just killing some bokoblin is a lot of fun.

Coophy,05-07-2017,"A ver, lo primero para aclarar es que la saga Zelda es una de las más influyentes a día de hoy pero no por eso hay que ponerla en un pedestal por cualquier obra que lleve este nombre, no niego que ocarina of time sea uno de los 5 mejores juegos de la historia gracias a la innovación, y con este nuevo Zelda me ha dado la sensación de que Nintendo está intentando cambiar las convenciones de la saga, pero olvidamos que estamos en 2017, es muy difícil innovar en las mecánicas de un videojuego (a pesar de que en el desarrollo cinematográfico de los videojuegos todavía queda un largo camino para alcanzar la calidad del de una película) y eso hace que las empresas que quieran innovar tan solo pueden agarrarse a una fórmula y explotarla para que dé lo máximo de sí misma, y esto es algo que este nuevo Zelda hace a la perfección, en este caso no coge los conceptos de su antecesor (Skyward Sword) sino que vuelve a sus inicios en la era de 8 bits que es de donde saca casi la totalidad de sus ideas, desde la libertad que te dan desde el principio del juego hasta los enemigos, estamos hablando de que la saga Zelda ha llegado a lo que quería ser desde que el primer juego salió al mercado, una experiencia de total libertad en todos sus apartados esto es algo ue muchos intentan pero pocos consiguen no hay ni que ir muy lejos ahí están juegos como Watch Dogs los cuales intentan que el entorno se sienta vivo pero faltan opciones para que realmente lo parezca, pero bueno me estoy llendo por las ramas,the legend of Zelda: breath of the wild es un gran videojuego que consigue lo que intenta. Tiene una jugabilidad realmente buena que te obliga a adaptarse continuamente a cada situación (al igual que Dark Souls) y es un sistema inmenso en cuanto a posibilidades hasta que empiezas a ver los límites, y sí, con esto me refiero a la repetitividad de los combates ya que a pesar de lo amplio que parece el sistema el juego no te dá ningún incentivo para no hacer lo mismo en la totalidad de los combates, otro de los grandes problemas es que hay muchos enemigos con muchas animaciones propias pero no están bien aprovechados ya que la inmensa mayoría (por no decir todos) pueden ser derrotados de la misma forma y a diferencia de otros juegos en los que cada enemigo tiene sus mecánicas para ser derrotados aquí la barra de vida es lo único que crea una diferencia real entre (por ejemplo) un bokoblin rojo y uno azul.

Aquí es donde comienzo la segunda parte del análisis donde voy a pasar explicar los problemas que he tenido con la historia. Está claro que este juego intenta contar una historia de gran calidad sobre una mujer que siente que es inferior al resto y a la que le acompaña un caballero que posee todas las cualidades que ella a querido tener durante la totalidad de su vida pero el problema es que la historia es contada a través de recuerdos, los cuales ocurrieron hace cien años por lo que en todo momento sientes que te gustaría estar realmente en ese instante pero no puedes por cómo limita la trama el hecho de que todo lo que ves ahí ya a ocurrido. Esto es algo que hacen otros juegos como Dark Souls pero ahí sientes en todo momento que todo se ha perdido y que realmente no hay vuelta a atrás al contrario que en Zelda en el cual hay aldeas en los que la gente no tiene problemas para seguir una vida normal y sientes que hay esperanza y que es un viaje en el que vas acompañado eso hace que pierdas el miedo a que es posible que nada se solucione.

Finalmente quiero decir que este nuevo Zelda es un gran juego y me parece una gran decisión que hayan intentado cambiar la fórmula para no quedarse estancados desde luego lo recomiendo mucho debido a su buena historia (mal contada) a su amplio sistema de combate (el cual se podría haber explotado más) y a su gran libertad (la cual es una locura que nunca antes se había visto en ningún otro videojuego). Se nota mucho que nintendo se ha esforzado para hacer este juego, ahora solo queda ver cómo será el futuro el cuál tiene pinta de ser muy prometedor y de que por fin, la industria va a evolucionar.

Gráficos: 9’1. Tal vez no sean los mas rompedores que hemos visto pero son preciosos y hacen que el mundo sea un lugar que te incite a explorarlo

Sonido: 9. Iba a ponerlo a parir en este análisis ya que echas en falta las melodías de otros juegos hasta que me puse a jugarlo con melodías antiguas y me dí cuenta de la belleza que tiene la melodía de este juego

ariley92,05-07-2017,"Game is generally fantastic. A different direction than other Zelda games, and one that was welcome with the new capabilities of the switch. I don't need to ramble on about the positives, others have done that, and there are many.

Originally, I'd have given this game a 9/10 because I believed the combat to be far too easy, and simple at that. Going around gathering food is a great way to make sure that you can never die against bosses, most of which were too similar. That, and the ending seemed super abrupt, with not quite enough to satisfy you after sinking that many hours into the game.

That being said, there is a story-based DLC to drop this holiday, so I'll reserve judgement on that front until that comes out. Also, I'm still in the middle of Master Mode, and it seems that the difficulty of enemies in this mode is finally up to a challenging level, which makes upgrading armor and simply getting around about as hard as it should be.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AlienKatze,19-07-2017,"No, Breath of the Wild is certainly not the best game of all time, probably not even the best Zelda game there is. (Besides the obvious Ocarina of time and Majoras Mask, i even like Twilight Princess more) Nevertheless, it still is an amazing game. I have played through the game with all Shrines and quests to do and even collected about 700 Korok seeds. It really doesnt feel like a Zelda game at all, but that doesnt take away from the fun. The game convinces not through its amazing but admittedly short story, but through its amazingly open world. If you do not like exploration and finding your own fun in games, then this is definitely not for you. There is infinitely much to do and everything can be done in different ways. It does suffer from some problems though. The fact that weapons break, and very easily too, seems to exist just to exist, but for no other particular reason.

The general controls and combat are a bit hard to pick up at first ( jump on x? ugh.. ), but pretty good later on. There are lots of different ways to approach encounters, so combat gets boring rather slowly.

As expected of Nintendo the music is amazing and fits perfecty when it has to (Miphas Theme, Guardian Theme)

I played the game on the Switch and never ever had to deal with any problems like crahses framedrops or other bugs, but i know that they exist. Ive played about equally much in handheld mode and docked with my Pro controller, though i think i actually like the handheld mode more. 720p in handheld mode and 900p on TV with 30fps on both seems pretty bad for 2017 and it might bother a lot of people, but i think the it still looks beatiful and smooth in-game.

In conclusion, It's an amazing open-world game with some flaws that might vary from big to nonexistant from person to person.

Would reccomend anyone with a switch or a Wii U to go pick it up, but dont buy the console just for the game if you dont have them. You could just save your money or buy a pizza instead.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
HappySpaceInvad,27-08-2020,"A lot of 10/10 reviews here, finding no fault with the game despite the outrageously derivative content (Skyrim, Dark Souls, Just Cause, plus every flippin’ Ubisoft open world game). And more than 1,000 ridiculously low scores... this game is certainly above average in some respects.

Personally, I think the Jimquisition review hit the nail on the head with both the score and the two key aspects that spoil this latest Link adventure. It’s the ludicrously fragile weapons, and Link’s surprisingly limited stamina that instantly breaks immersion and make you feel the game doesn’t want you to enjoy your time in Hyrule too much (unless you’re a masochist of course).

What makes this worse is this situation doesn’t improve as you progress through the game. It’s actually impossible to ever get Link’s stamina anywhere near that of an average human (in terms of running ability) and the one single unbreakable weapon you eventually get has a limited number of hits before it’s unusable for a period of time... so not a massive improvement. My personal bugbear is that I never seem to get one-handed weapons other than useless wooden clubs... I have 8 two-handed swords, that I dislike fighting with.

And the faux-English accents of the (American) English language voice actors really are dreadful; if you are even vaguely conversant in any other language (bearing in mind you can retain English subtitles) I would urge you to switch (pun intended). I chosen Spanish (Latin American) myself, which means the game serves a second purpose as a much-needed boost to my vocabulary. Mexican Zelda (Zeldacita?) is much less of a sighing wet blanket, and you can actually hear what she’s saying above the background music, which is a bonus.

If the game didn’t apparently hate me so much, I’d love to give it 8 or 9 out of 10. As it is.. 7 will have to do.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Aside from a few nice moments the game lacks serious motivation as to why someone should wander around this massive, yet empty open world.

They threw away all the traditional things that made Zelda games what they are in order to create this massive open world that has anything but depth. Even Assasin Creed games have more interesting open worlds than this. Korok seed after korok seed after korok seed after shrine after shrine after shrine and oh, a chest with yet another breakable item. Copy and paste and repeat.

I can only look back to Ocarina of Time. A masterpiece. Timetravel, young Link, adult Link.

- The empty open world dilutes the Zelda experience. There are few dungeons. Not even the final castle has puzzles.
- The annoying, bullet sponge ancient guardians are everywhere. Their sound already makes me nuts.
- The tutorial takes HOURS.
- Cooking is terrible. It takes 10 times longer than it should because the menus are bad. It also makes combat meaningless, since you can negate every damage you take. They then ""balanced"" that by making enemies almost one-hit you, but you can still eat again. Combat just takes longer and takes many, many pauses and is honestly broken.
- Weapons seem to be made of glass and break in 5 hits. Throwing them break them instantly. More inventory pauses everytime!
- The same 5 enemies are repeated over and over again.
- Only one attack button.
- Backstabs sometimes just don't work.
- Exploration is severely hindered by Link's ridiculously low stamina. Climbing is SLOW.
- Rain. Nintendo decided it would be a good idea to make climbing impossible for 2 minutes with no way to speed up time during this. Thunderstorms can one-shot you if you don't take out metal equipment. Fun!

Carlinhos_86,23-11-2019,"Zelda: Breath of the Wild is huge, beautiful and plays great, and I love that ramp up in combat challenge compared to past Zelda iterations. But to me, the positive aspects of this game end here, and its downsides sum up to make it only a passable Zelda experience.

I personally miss the thematic dungeons of past games, and the gadgets you earned in them. In the previous entries, it felt like all the minor puzzles in a dungeon were part of a bigger, cohesive puzzle that led me to a reward in the form of a the new trinket, and an epic boss fight. This feeling is gone in Breath of the Wild, as the beasts and shrines offer no new tools for your inventory, and the boss designs are uninspired.

Enemy variety is lackluster.

The weapon breaking system was a joy killer, since it turned weapons into basically consumable items. They could've made the system similar to Dark Souls, where the weapons last much longer than a couple hits and are repairable. This way, the top tier weapons are provided to the player much more sparingly, and they actually feel like a reward, instead of a consumable. This even opens up room for the existence of unique boss weapons, since you can repair them if they break.

This last complain is a nitpick of mine, but I loathe autosave, specially when it saves to multiple files. This seems to be a trend in the latest Nintendo's first party games (looking at you, Luigi's Mansion). If you're going to make an autosave system, give me the option to turn it off and/or make me able to delete the files I don't want to keep.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

To many shrines with ALL the same color, I was just hoping for a one room shrine to get ride of it. It was a wonderful creation for his visuals and the playability of Link.

halleprematarum,28-09-2020,"Legends of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is honestly the most beautiful video game I've ever played. The visuals are so unique and pleasing. Sometimes while I'm wandering random locations I find the right place at the right time and come across the most beautiful views, it's hard to believe that their not even real. Playing botw is so surreal and entertaining, you feel so involved and interested in the game, and you never run out of stuff to do when there's seemingly endless tasks and missions to complete. The premise is so cool and the characters are great too. I also love the exploring and travelling aspect of the game. All the villages are so unique and cool with their own aesthetics and resources that you may need. Finding all the special horses and exploring the map is also very fun even though it's probably considered an optional aspect of the game. Overall I really really love this game and would recommend to anybody of any age or interests. There is definetly a reason it has a score of 97 from critics. Breath of the Wild is the closest you'll likely get to a perfect video game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Altendo,26-03-2022,"A great game, with open-world designs, full voice acting, and better shaded models that remind me of The Wind Waker.

shadowbocksin,05-11-2021,"The game is a 6/10 and once you take off the fanboy goggles the game isn't the 10 it deserves, okay maybe I should add more to that. The game is 6/10 IF you played other zelda games and other and better open world games and I've done both while not fanboying over this game. So you might be thinking ""why would I give this a 6/10"" and you're more and likely quick to get fanboy elitist like fanboys do nowadays thinking I'm some troll but no, compare this game to other zelda games and the only thing it does right is the open world AND THAT'S IT.

It does story in the WORST WAY POSSIBLE not just for legend of zelda standards but for gaming standards in general. The story is optional, let me repeat that, the story is optional. Now I understand zelda isn't really about story that much but again compare this to other zelda games like ocarina, majora's mask, wind waker, and twilight princess and it makes no sense why the story is something that can be ignored.

The game play is decent that's it, I'm not gonna go to far into it but it just does things that are basic like wall climbing, sprinting, and freedom to do fight however you want.

The game is way to easy to the point you're not punished for anything and don't sit there telling me about how you died because that tells me you didn't use (abuse) the cooking system and the stupidly endless amount of ways to help yourself out in a fight. In past zelda games if you died it's because of a certain curveball that was thrown your way unexpectedly but here it's mostly because ""I thought the healing/defensive/offensive items I had were enough"" which I found that I never ran out of. Again I understand games have to be casual to attract a certain crowd but BoTW is so casual that people go in as their first zelda game and walk out thinking the games have always been this childish of a baby's first open world game that makes even star fox adventures look like ninja gaiden.

The shrines are dumb, stupidly easy, pointless unless you REALLY want the master sword, and not worth it at all since you can still increase your health (temporarily) with potions and food. Now what does shrines have to do with health? When you complete a shrine you get a spirit orb, collect four and you can either increase health or stamina, both of which aren't really needed for the completion of the game since you can just use potions and food to do that for you.

The dumbest one of all that gets defended the most by fanboys, the weapon durability. Compare the weapon durability to something like elder scrolls and if you still defend how quick the weapons break then you're a deluded pathetic fanboy. There is no reason a sword should break by swinging at the air (I'm not even kidding) and by all means please go and explain that I'll grab a chair and listen to whatever pathetic excuse you have for that. And shockingly, the master sword doesn't break but has to ""recharge"" which wouldn't be so bad if you still could use the sword just as a weaker variant but you can't. It just becomes unusable for 20 minutes and by the time you get it if you decide to go after it the thing does pathetic damage, all that hard work for a sword that does as much damage as a basic hyrule sword and less than the other more powerful weapons.

Overall the game isn't even that good it's just beautiful to look at, enemy variety is basic, like PS1 basic. Have you seen grandma's boy? You know that part where the asian guy tells JP about re-coloring the enemies to save time and not have to re-design them? Yeah that's what it is here like they took a page out of a typical mario game and slapped it on here and before you go ""well this is nintendo they always do this"" then it means you haven't played any nintendo game outside mario, pokemon, and zelda. At the time of this games release sure it MIGHT've been something worth playing on switch because there wasn't much worth playing till splatoon 2 or Xenoblade 2 dropped but now? Amongst the entire library available? I can think of five better open world games and that was just a 2 second quick thought process, also keep in mind this is a wii u game and even for wii u Xenoblade Chronicles X is FAR more interesting than this and offers a BETTER open world experience with a BETTER VARIETY OF ENEMIES native to each new location.

For that true legend of zelda experience this ain't it chief unless you just want to experience the open world of hyrule that this game offers which is the ONLY highlight of the game, everything else is just mediocre and doesn't compare to other open world games.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

CoolBR,17-10-2022,"It is a good game, I can see the amount of effort that the developers put into this game.

The only thing I didn't like was the story. I've felt a lack of a good story, it is just too generic about saving a kingdom, also I despise mute protagonists. Maybe I didn't like the story because I didn't play the older Zelda games, but I still think that the story is generic anyways and I appreciate a good depth story in the games I play.

The gameplay is the best part of the game, the combat is awesome. The base is a ""Souls Style of Combat"" but it has some peculiarities that make it even more interesting. The weapons you use always will break there is nothing you can do to stop them to break so you need to change the weapons and each weapon has a different type of attack and some have special moves like light beams, that really incentive the player to try out different weapons and I really liked. It is cool you don't need to upgrade your weapon to use it, so you can pick up any weapon from the ground and you are ready to use it immediately.

Another peculiarity is how intuitive is the combat, pretty much everything you think works out like you can make things fall over the enemies to kill them, you can throw them on the water, you can use stealth. It is really fun.

The puzzles and the exploration are good, nothing at Mario Odyssey puzzles level but it is still better than the average puzzles you see in the games industry.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ShadowofZexa,25-10-2021,"Breath Of Wild is a great game, no doubt about it. However the game feels way too different from other Zelda games and feels worse because of it. The combat in Zelda hasn't been amazing but it worked in this game it's very difficult since the game wants have good reaction time to pull off attacks that do a lot damage. That's okay but having to do this a lot since your weapons in this game don't do too much damage. There is also no way to upgrade your weapons to make them do more damage. One issue in this game that is almost a dealbreaker at times is your durability of your weapons they feel like sticks and break very easily. There is also no way to upgrade your weapons making for a lot of weapon hunting and inventory management which is very slow and boring.
The story is pretty good but not amazing like in Skyward Sword, The graphics look amazing and I love the way Nintendo made the visuals in this game. Another thing I do like the use of voice acting in the game and it's a welcome edition to the Zelda series. Overall Breath Of The Wild is good blueprint for BOTW 2 that I believe can be an amazing game if they improve on it's flaws.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I would give this game 9/10 if it were on a better gaming platform that could enable 4k/60.

I know there are great games in every console, etc, and I want even better games for each, I just underestimated Nintendo in this case, I guess. and man, was i wrong. It is too, as good as red dead. I was totally wrong about that. it is a little bit simpler, but thats not a demerit , it's just the way it is.
oh, btw, imo, BotW gives you the oportunity to fight one of the most epic final boss ever in your hand, wherever, even tho i recomend setting it down on the rack to play in a big ass 4k tv
I'm so very impressed, really
ps: I ALMOST gave this a 9 because of some really minor disconforts such as link not grabing the next weapon or shield in the inventory whenever one breaks wich can make you die in a most frustrating way, but come on, these things cant take the bright shine off of the game

Definitely not the best Zelda ever. The weapon durability system is stupid. Everything doesn't need to hit like a damn truck. The dungeons are pitifully short. Most of your playtime is spent running around and climbing. The mechanics are poorly explained. The food system is interesting but annoying. The tutorial plateau was the most fun part until I was met with the disappointment that was the rest of the game. It's like they created this huge open area and then added the other stuff last minute. Even Phantom Hourglass was better than this. I'd maybe place it 5th or 6th in the list, below ALTTP, OOT, LA, and Link Between Worlds. I get that they wanted to change up the formula, but this just isn't good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Wimpher,09-11-2022,"Wow like wth is up with all these 10’s? I think everyone just WANTS this game to be the greatest of all time. They’ve decided this long before the game even came out. It’s ZELDA, after all…and Nintendo. They can do no wrong, right?
So yeah, has anyone figured that maybe, just maybe those 0 reviews are just counterweight to all the mindless, brainless 10’s this game is receiving? Because to me this is nowhere near as charming of a game as Ocarina of Time was. And that game I bought day one and even got the gold cartridge. I find BotW to be one of the most grossly overrated video games I have come across.
There’s greatness in there, sure…but overall I find the games design to be bland and dull. The dungeons are a huge yawn fest compared to the masterfully designed areas of OoT and I found the entire soundtrack to be lazy and boring. Also I can’t stand the new design for Link.

I don’t know….I just feel this game isn’t really the Zelda I once loved. OoT and TP are both vastly superior Zelda games to me.

Lastly, the original Final Fantasy VII is still the greatest video game ever made and no one will ever change my mind.

See? Opinions. Not everyone is going to be brainwashed into praising this game like it’s the second coming of Christ. Seriously based on all these 10’s that’s what I was assuming and came out absolutely disappointed. I ain’t gonna give it a 0 ad it’s a solid video game but I understand why some are gonna want to give it a 0.
There are so many games that I find far more superior such as Shadow of the Colossus (ps4), God of War, A Plague Tale (both games), Resident Evil 2, The Last Guardian, etc.

Honestly, I think I have very particular tastes and unique style and many games of this new generation don’t even really appeal to me anymore. Most of my other all time favs ever come from the past like Silent Hill 2, FFVII, FFVIII, FFX, Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver, ICO, Vagrant Story, Chrono Cross, Tekken 3, Prince of Persia Sands of Time, Contra, Streets of Rage, Ninja Gaiden I can go on and on…..

UncleEd,21-03-2020,"First things first, I had never played a Zelda game before. These impressions are those of a newcomer, not a diehard Zelda fan. Breath of the Wild won so many awards and is often referred to as one of the best games of the last decade and it is easy to be disappointed when the expectations are so high. Fortunately, BotW lived up to the hype.

BotW offers a magical open-world experience. Visually, it is breathtakingly beautiful. Controls are tight and satisfying. The most impressive thing about BotW, however, is how much this vast world is full of surprises. It is truly open-world, just walk in any direction and something will distract you. And chances are that distraction will lead you to a hidden surprise. On your journey, Link can interact with the environment in all sorts of crazy ways. Such interaction is not necessary to progress, but nevertheless an interesting touch that encourages creative thinking.

In BotW, you can explore shrines and strengthen your character. You can gather plants and hunt animals, cook them which will grant you the same or even better (yet temporary) benefits than shrines do. There are plenty of puzzles both in shrines and dungeons (divine beasts) in the main storyline. In terms of puzzles, I enjoyed the former, but the divine beasts not so much. You can complete quests and get the rewards. BotW has weapon durability and I think it was a wise decision to implement this game mechanic to make sure the game doesn’t get repetitive fast (unlike many other open-world games).

There will be a feeling of diminishing returns in BotW sometime after 50-60 hours of gameplay. You may start to feel like you’ve had enough of Zelda, despite all the efforts of BotW to offer unique experiences to different playstyles. My suggestion on that would be to enjoy the open world when you start the game and focus on the main quest as soon as you start feeling overwhelmed by all the quests and shrines. Do not aim for 100% completion.

The only reason I don’t give it a 10 out of 10 is that Breath of the Wild does not speak to me on a personal level as much as some other “perfect games” do. However, it is still a perfect game, both technically and gameplaywise.

There are a ton of excellent secrets hidden inside the world that gives an extended playthrough a little extra kick intermittently. However, a large number of shrines feel samey, some of them are painfully simple, and some of them are solved in the exact same way as other shrines. Moreover, there are no real dungeons, the rain mechanic gets in the way of climbing (which is otherwise excellent), and forces you to just stop and wait for it to pass, the world starts to feel extremely empty once you have cleared all the towers and gotten around 60 shrines in, the story is bad, and the stealth missions are worse (thankfully they are few and far between).

U can't see past the grind. The experience is 75 percent of a slow crawl just to get to that amazing 25 percent. This might be fine in some cases but when u have 75% in a 50hr campaign, it's hard to forgive. It's like playing all that middle section for red dead 2, only double it. The ""stamina"" mechanic feels put in just to lengthen the game. The maps mostly empty, with very slim ways to travel. Every tomb has the same dialogue at the end, the bosses are just reused, u might see 2 people in the game every 18hrs. The people u do get are interesting, along with their side quest but it's like none we're put in. If anyone else done something like this (no man sky) it would have been torn apart.

The lack of invisible walls gives the player full control, and there is a shrine around every corner to draw the players to a new puzzle.

The physics in the game are unlike any other video game as well. The story is simple but epic, adding great voiceover work for the first time in a Zelda game.

I have now added over 160 hours and I still haven't explored every little nook and cranny and still have over a hundred koroks to gather. One of the best Legend of Zelda games in the franchise, if not one of the greatest games of all time!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MisterMacys,16-02-2021,"It was alright. I get that the devs wanted to emphasize personal exploration, but it meant the plot just ended up lacking any real drama or sense of urgency.

julione,27-03-2019,"Having spent roughly 70 hours into the game ( havent finished the story yet) I must say this is one the the absolutely best games i have ever played, it is really innovating and new, 120 different shrines with mini puzzles and almost every single one of the them feels interesting and new and fun.

The four ""bigger"" temples that are in the game are also very new and you really have to analize them and really think.

The outdoor world is also incredible amazing and it feels like wherever you go you can find some minipuzzle or some secret wich can benefit you on your journey.

For the first hours of the game i really didnt like the weapon-breaking system but the further you got in the game the more you learnd how to handle yourself in battle and you also get longer lasting weapons the longer you get into the game ( you can also unlock the master sword later wich does not break but have a cooldown instead)

It feels like the most people who are downrating this game havent even got past the first zone (always complaining about the weapon-system) or people who played a zelda game for the very first time who doesnt understand or like the puzzle system in the shrines/temple..

Just buy it",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
thecasualgaymer,16-02-2021,"A great game, but not my cup of tea. The shrines didn't feel like compelling puzzles, the combat was fine but the frequency of the weapons breaking was annoying, and the post game content is literally nothing. It's just the game pretending as though nothing has changed.

BrunoVn00,21-03-2020,"This needs to be the best Zelda game ever made. The world is massive and full of life and with so many things to do. The world is really its own character. The controls and the gameplay mechanics are easy to understand, responsive and excellent. Despite its performance issues at launch, the game runs smoothly now. I love the realistic physics, the overall difficulty and challenge, the massive amount of side-quests and shrines to explore, the sound design (I love playing it with headphones in portable mode), the GORGEOUS art style and beautiful score. Yeah, the main quest has a pretty cliché story, Nintendo rarely tells stories that aren't cliché. Yeah, while it's the first Zelda with actual voice acting, it is pretty mediocre and it's full of cliché and cheesy lines, but that's not what we play the game for, that's not what makes or breaks the game, what does is literally everything else but the story...And my God this game is so addicting and fun to play.

One of my very favorite games of all time and by far the best game to this day you can buy for your switch.

It's one of those games where you realise while playing, what you were missing in other games.
Lot's of attention to details, a world freely to discover in whatever order you like and most importantly: the adventure of discovering is the main focus.
No story where an open world is pressurely crafted around it but instead a world which story you need to discover.

The visuals are outstanding, the sounds of nature are welcoming, the story is exciting, the game play is nothing less of thrilling. The reason that it is easier is because of its open world nature, it's possible to go to the final boss right after you leave the tutorial.

alanwaketan,29-04-2020,本作优点实在是太多，在这里就简单的说说三点。一：自然是出色的开放世界设计。这个开放世界真的是太赞了， 广阔之余又十分充实。游览之时兴奋点如雨后春笋般接踵而至。你永远能找到你的下一个神庙。二：互动系统，这套化学系统真的是太奇妙了。如果是前者是一张静态的清明上河图，那么这套系统就让它动起来了。世界里头几乎所有物体都有其独特的化学反应。比如举着火把去雪山不会被冻着。又比如用雷击电水里头的怪能立马把其电死。配合着林克的技能和装备，真可谓千变万化。三：引导。本作的引导不同于任何游戏，更别提育碧式的checklist开放世界引导系统。于小处才能见真章。本作的引导系统精华就在此。林克的万能蜘蛛手套为什么要这么黏，就是因为只有让玩家什么都能爬，玩家才有登高望远的冲动。一览众山小之余玩家就能确定之后要干什么。剧情打碎，迷宫打碎，任务打碎，每一个碎片分散在每座山峰之间环环相扣循序渐进。不需要什么checklist也不需要任何演出，玩家自然而然就能知道自己该干嘛了。这内功真的是太出色了。再配合上NS的便携性，每个碎片也自然而然的填充着玩家们的碎片时间，让你沉迷其中不能自拔。,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

joconnorj108,09-03-2020,"FYI - No plot or story spoilers here, but I do talk a little bit about some game mechanics and game-play.

First of all, I do not understand all of the negative reviews I have seen for this game. To each their own and hate this game if you want, but this is my favorite video game of all-time. Hands down. No question about it.

I don't even know where to begin. To me, this game is the best, most immersive, enjoyable game ever. I love that a lot of the mechanics of the game are realistic. If an enemy shoots an arrow at you and you block it with a wooden shield, the arrows sticks into the wooden shield and you can keep the arrow. If you block an arrow with a metal shield, it bounces off or shatters. I enjoy the simple stuff like that that most games don't do.

Also, the game is so huge and immersive, it's tough to get things done because I keep wanting to check out every cave or camp I run or ride past. Even just collecting mushrooms is something I genuinely enjoy. The world they have created in this game just feels so real, interactive, complete and magically amazing.

the only ""complaint"" I really have is the story. The story is solid but I liked the story in some other Zelda games better. Regardless, this does not take away from the game, in my opinion.

If you're a Zelda fan or even just a fan of games in general, this one is an absolute masterpiece and a can't-miss. I can't stress it enough, PLAY THIS GAME!!!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Epicgamerguy,21-02-2020,"The game is so vast and beautiful, that it is impossible for you not to go off on your own adventure on your first play through. There are so many new mechanics that i have never seen in a video game, ever. The game gives you a sense of reward for exploration and completing puzzles or fights which all add up to a great gaming experience. The story is one of the greatest i have ever seen, yet barely any dialogue is spoken. It tells you everything about what happened 100 years ago with the fall of Hyrule by just walking around, all of the ruins and destroyed Guardians speak more than anyone you actually speak to. Every shrine you complete gives you a sense of accomplishment, that is so satisfying, because you feel like you have overcome a challenge. There is so much adventure to be had that no matter what direction you go, you are getting one step closer to winning. I always hated puzzle games, and i thought this would be another washed up puzzle RPG. BUT IT IS SO MUCH MORE. You ARE Link, you ARE living in Hyrule. This game is so immersive, so breath taking, that you can't help but love it. Everyone in the game has their own personality, and everyone seems like and important person to talk to.All of this adds to an experience unlike any other that is sure to make you want to play again and again, no doubt, if you have a switch and don't have this game, shame on you.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

However when the game wants you to fight enemies or bosses the music is amazing. In the topic of bosses they are all unique to each other and bring a new favor to the game. The battle system is very well made, it makes you want to find more weapons to enhance your self by exploring the open world and wining puzzle shrines which is genius. The story is very simple but it hits you with it’s simplicity, not to mention the many great moments you get to have in this game are perfect.

Aerrihn,20-03-2020,"Firstly, I have only sunk 75 hours into the game, I have not spent more than 2 months on the game, I have no doubt that people who have spent longer will have a different opinion to mine.

A very non traditional Zelda game. Feels polished for a casual playthrough and has enough content to keep you busy for at least 60 hours, or 1 hour should you choose the hard route.

Music is by far the best part of the game for me. Good choice of instrument as well as folly as most of the game is just that. Again, it gives otherwise silent parts of traveling a beautiful or even breathtaking landscape a lot of character and atmosphere.

The traversal mechanics felt very freeing, but still had ways to limit travel by either stamina restrictions or by weather. With temperature gauges as well as the law/traditions of towns, the restrictions feel acceptable instead of an invisible wall or a wall that you can never cross.
Combat feels a little shallow but more than makes up for it with variety in weapons which you will inevitably have to use as weapons can break upon being used for too long. Also, a few of the major mechanics are not taught to the player unless the player has visited a shrine that requires that mechanic.

The story was the most disappointing part for me as I have usually come to expect a deep story when it came to zelda games (deep whether it was implied or just told straight up to the player). There are very few cutscenes given the amount of hours a player can spend on the game, however where there are cutscenes it does the job of filling in the player with just enough information to understand what is going on in the grand scheme of things (the grand scheme which players will forget as they are not constantly reminded of what the main quest is). These cutscenes are a decent work of cinematography as well as voice acting, not to mention the musical piece accompanying. After watching each one I would always wish there was another coming soon, however, these cutscenes need to be found in the world by the player meaning there is always a chance a player will never find one without internet help as the map is so big.

Many of the sidequests are a little boring, almost like filler, but that's to be expected. However, there were some that were memorable whether it was the story behind it or it was the changes it made to the actual map that would stay even after the side quest.

The map itself is very large but a player can expect there to be something to do from one spot to another that's close by. However, for a casual player a lot of that can feel like filler. The DLC does make traversal a lot easier among the base tools that the game gives naturally. This game is also one of the best uses of the ""Ubisoft Tower"" that I've ever played with.

Overall it is an amazing game and developers should be commended for the feat of design and programming. It is still a must have on any Nintendo Switch even 3 years after it's release.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ItsJamal,02-04-2020,"This is simply put one of the best world designs created in a game. I have so many hours between multiple playthroughs and there is still so much more I constantly find out when I test new things. There are a few minor flaws but it's the closest I think a game will get to a masterpiece

Pros

The dungeons having 4 good and well fleshed out quests along with the use of shrines as mini puzzles made traveling rewarding and gameplay streamlined

Combat is simple but requires immense skill and can be modified to whatever way you want to play. The weapon durability system encourages thoughtful resource management and pushes you to try new weapon types that you may have otherwise steered away from

Story is simple but works well with the ""rediscover hyrule"" idea since it allows you to play the game how you want, finding Easter eggs and knowledge as you go on while also having main themes and places you must be

Graphics are amazing and probably the best port we will see on the switch fir a long time

Collecting and exploration has never felt more simple and satisfying with such a well done method of finding shrines, kooks, and locations that push you towards 100% or just a nice sense of satisfaction

Cons Rain is good for limiting movement but it limits movement a bit too much and it is often difficult to light a time skipping fire by that time which makes it mildly inconvenient The musical score for this game is amazing but suffers from a lack of use as you often just get a few piano keys, simple touches like more majestic horse riding music or a variety of daytime travel ambience would be nice


I could go on for so much longer but I have to say this is one of my top 3 games of the 2010 decade, it has a wonderful design that allows anyone to put well over 200 hours into a single playthrough. A true masterpiece that will shape games to come, 10/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Biberattacke,01-05-2020,"Das letzte Zelda was ich wirklich intensiv gespielt habe war Twighlight Princess (2006) auf der Wii und gefiel mir nicht gut aber nicht so gut wie die anderen Zelda spiele die ich bisher gespielt habe. Das grandiose Ocarina of Time (1998) und der Klassiker vom SNES A Link to the Past (1991). Für mich gilt also die Regel alle 10 Jahre einmal Zelda. So lange will ich aber eigentlich gar nicht warten, denn Breath of the Wild ist fantastisch und hat mich fast genau so in den Bann gezogen wie Ocarina of Time damals. Warum nicht genauso liegt meiner Meinung nach nicht einmal am Spiel sondern daran, dass ich mit fortschreitender Erfahrung und Alter einfach nicht mehr so aus dem Häuschen zu bringen bin wie ich es früher war. Dennoch BotW ist fantastisch. Die Hardware der Switch ist wirklich nicht die Stärkste und dennoch sieht das Spiel so fantastisch aus und hört sich grandios an. Alles passt! Immer wenn ich die Switch anschmiss um wirklich zu spielen fühlte ich mich wohl. Das schafft das Spiel einfach irgendwie. Es muckelt einen in eine warme Decke voll von guten Gefühlen und stellt einem noch eine Lieblingswarmgetränk hin. Zum Spiel: Ganondorf der Oberbösewicht hat Hyrule mal wieder unterjocht. Er ist aber nicht bei voller Stärke und ist kurz davor aufzuwachen. Wir hingegen (als spitzöhriger Elf Link) wachen auf und wissen nicht wer wir sind und warum...? Deswegen verlassen wir den Tempelhöhlenort in dem wir 100 Jahre gepennt haben um die Welt draußen zu erkunden. Alleine die Szene in der wir die Höhle verlassen lässt mich wohlig schaudern. Es ist einfach wunderschön in Szene gesetzt. Die zu erkundende Welt von verschiedenen Temperaturzonen ist frei erkundbar. Die Umwelteinflüsse spielen in diesem Zelda eine große Rolle. Temperatur, Gewitter und Regen sind für den Spielablauf wichtig. Irgendwann kommt man darauf, dass bestimmte Shrine gesucht werden müssen um stärker zu werden. Hier müssen kleine Rätsel gelöst werden. Die Zelda üblichen Dungeons sind in 4 große mechanische Tiere gestopft worden. Einerseits muss man in dieses große Viech hinein, dann muss man die Rätsel im Tier lösen und den Endboss besiegen. Innerhalb dieser Tiere sind Schalter um diese roboterartigen Geschöpfe so zu manipulieren, dass innerhalb wiederum Wege frei werden. Das ist wirklich fantastisch! Die Steuerung geht wie immer perfekt von der Hand. Das beste Open World Action Adventure was ich bisher gespielt habe!!!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Да, основной сюжет далеко не самый крутой в игровой индустрии, да и бормотание нпц вместо полноценных озвучек странно выглядит (когда в катсценах нормально говорить они умеют), но в игре сделан упор в геймплей, и геймплей тут один из самых интересных и лучших, что я видел. Внимание к мелочах нереальное, я до последних часов прохождения открывал какие-то новые мелкие нюансы. Графика и артдизайн красивые, смена дня и ночи, разные погодные условия сделаны отлично, фпс почти всегда стабилен, как игру смогли настолько хорошо оптимизировать под железо свича - для меня загадка. Боевка несложная и приятная в управлении, арсенал очень разнообразен, всякие эликсиры, еда тоже не утомляли, да блин, здесь ничего не утомляет! Испытания в виде святилищ постоянно интриговали, некоторые были легкими, а над некоторыыми прям приходилось ломать голову.

fedehorn,10-07-2021,"Finally after all the good reviews I played this game and maybe because my expectation were high I felt a bit disappointed. I didn't really appreciate some game mechanics like the absence of a weapons status (since them can be destroyed you don't really know which one is worth to kept), some special moves have the same buttons of others attack (ZL is used both to guard and for Daruk’s Protection, and long Y press for strong attack and for Urbosa’s Fury) and more in general the combat sistem could be improved. Some other thigs didn't get a proper tutorial so on early fase was vary hard to manage (horse mount and the mechanism to create potion and food). The game doesn't give a proper count of all the sub activities like shrine, you don't really know how many of them are missing unless you walk without a real dastination, in an area you could have done everything but the game didn't inform you. That's sad because the shrine puzzles were the funniest part of the game. From an aestetic and graphic point of view I've nothing to say, just awsome some times a slightery frame rate drop but nothing to impossible to face. The story is maybe to weak, I would have preferred more dept and diversify main missions, in the end you just need to do the same thing 4 times before facing the boss.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Zethor,17-08-2020,"Breath of the Wild is a wonderfully ambitious game with so much to offer, but its ambition often gets in the way of becoming a more well-made game. It is one of the most free games out there supporting so many different playstyles and approaches, yet has baffling decisions that restrict these freedoms. It is a game that respects your time and allows you to ignore key story beats and create your own adventure, yet tries to railroad players into playing through its narrative anyway, causing the game to feel hollow for anyone expecting a game similar to previous zelda titles, as the strong linear dungeon design and memorable plots that define that game are completely absent here. It is a game that tries to present puzzles to the player through its various shrines, only to make these puzzles feel half-baked and incomplete. Breath of the Wild is a game of contradictions; a game that will likely feel middling to those wanting a more traditional Zelda experience.

Despite these criticisms, Breath of the Wild is one of the most enjoyable games I've ever played; its weak dungeon design and unmemorable plots make it easy for a player such as myself to simply ignore them and enjoy the freedom the game provides me, the various restrictions on one's freedom such as rain allow me to find new creative ways to find my freedom anyway by using the game's incredibly strong - and at the same time horribly broken - physics, the half-baked puzzles lend themselves to being broken and ignored entirely with enough creativity, with any two trips through many shrines not being the same for me between playthroughs as I slowly learn how to abuse the game's physics more and more to reach the end of these shrines in the strangest, most satisfying ways possible, and for those seeking a more traditional Zelda experience the game still provides an abundance of sidequests that allow my friends who don't have the same outlook as I do to sink 200+ hours into this game in a single playthrough. I myself have done the same, but over multiple playthroughs as I find new ways to bend this game to my will; this game that provides a sense of freedom and satisfaction unlike any other. This isn't even getting into the game's art and music, both of which are absolutely stunning; this game is the best that the Zelda series has ever looked, and the competition for a title like that is strong.

This does not mean that the complaints are not warranted. Those complaints are what make this game worthy of a 7, despite my glowing review. But it is because of these complaints that a simple score cannot do this game justice; it may be a horribly flawed game with issues one could talk about for hours, but it's also one of the most ambitious games I've ever played, and is my favorite game currently on either of the consoles this game was released on for that reason.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Alyena,19-02-2022,"Perso, j'ai kiffé son open-world organique et cohérent. Le gameplay est aux **** oignons et est adapté à son monde ouvert. Il s'agit très clairement d'un grand jeu qui séduit par ses mécaniques révolutionnaires, bien huilées, et sa liberté. La bande-son, jugée mi-figue, mi-raisin par certains est toute aussi élaborée. Évidemment, sans oublier son sound-design innovant et complémentaire à l'exploration qui est poussée à son paroxysme, ainsi que la physique, léchée, qui n'a jamais été aussi développée et aboutie dans l'histoire des jeux vidéos. Zelda Breath of The Wild incarne donc un véritable accomplissement sur ce point là. On note également la pureté des environnements qui sont dépouillés de quasiment toute vie humaine, dans ce monde perdu et dévasté, et qui se mettent au service d'une direction artistique qui permet des panoramas à couper le souffle. Loin d’être juste ""un bon jeu mais un mauvais Zelda"", ce petit bijou n’hésite pas à donner un bon coup de pied dans la fourmilière dans le but de dépoussiérer le genre du monde ouvert. Ce jeu désormais classique par sa philosophie du ""monde ouvert au service du gameplay"" est un pionnier du genre, il s’agit d’un aboutissement pour le jeu vidéo dans son ensemble, dans le sens où il pousse sans aucune vergogne le joueur à se dévier de sa quête principale pour toujours plus explorer ce monde d’Hyrule regorgeant de vie et d’activités, quitte à le guider vers des camps ennemis. N’est-elle finalement pas là, la véritable quête principale du joueur ? Le bestiaire, justement, leur design ainsi que celui de leur habitat atteint justement une cohérence et une logique rarement vue dans les jeux vidéos. Les ennemis qui d’ailleurs, loin d’avoir une IA aux fraises, sont dotés d’une véritable capacité de réflexion, n’hésitant pas à utiliser l’environnement qui les entoure pour se défendre ou attaquer. Enfin, il ne faut pas oublier de mentionner les donjons dans lesquels on atteint très clairement le summum de l’ingéniosité en terme de mécaniques de gameplay. Zelda Breath of The Wild est donc une pépite, non, un véritable chef d’œuvre dans lequel on voit à quel point le monde d'Hyrule est consistant et où les développeurs ont su trouver le parfait équilibre entre sanctuaires, donjons, villages, et exploration. Définitivement, une vraie pièce de maître.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Not_A_Shill,31-12-2020,"Hello, I'm absolutly not a paid corporate shill and this is my unbiased Review for THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD is a masterpiece of video game narrative. Nothing else even comes close. The story is brutal, challenging, bold, and almost never ""fun"". It is harrowing, forcing the player to confront violence in a way video games never do. In a medium where everything is John Wick, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD is Schindler's List.

And just like that film, there were times when I wasn't sure I could keep going. It is a relentless emotional assault that I suspect will force even the most jaded gamer to feel empathy. The game is a work of art - every aspect feels crafted at the highest level. Visuals, audio, controls, animation, level design, performance. It is astounding. And frequently beautiful.

With moments you NEVER find in video games. But I cannot overstate how harrowing it is. It feels like 2 seasons of the darkest TV show you'll ever find, and it frequently better than most TV on the air. That's saying a lot. I think it is an IMPORTANT game. It tore me up, and I will never, ever forget THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD is a game that will change you.

In short, THE LEGEND OF ZELDA: BREATH OF THE WILD put me through hell. I did not enjoy it. I wasn't supposed to. I was affected by it. Like no game before. I am in awe of it. I am recovering from it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Napsta,08-10-2021,"I mean, what do I say that hasn't been already been said? It's incredible. The fact that you can go wherever you want and play the game however you want in this extraordinary world is just that. Incredible. There's so much to explore, so much you can choose whether or not you want to do. You want to rush into the castle immediatly after leaving the great plateau? Sure go ahead, it'll be more difficult but you can do it. You want to explore the entire world and complete every single shrine? It will definitely take a while, but you can do that too! The combat is also much deeper than you might think. You can always go the tried and true ""unga bunga with weapon"" approach, and yeah that will get the job done. Or you could try and pick them all off from a distance with a bow and arrow. Or you could roll a remote bomb into some explosive barrels and walk away from the explosion like a cool guy. Or you could use magnesis and drop a giant metal crate onto their head. These are just a few ways you can go about dealing with them. Not every way you can choose to do things will be as effective as the other choices, but the fact that you can choose to handle a situation in so many ways is absolutely incredible. Every time I want to do another playthrough of this game, I always find something new to enjoy, some new way to approach an encounter or an area, and that is incredible. To put it simply, this game gives you a lot of freedom to do what you want, and there are tons of things you could want to do. I, like so many people, absolutely adore this game, and if you for some reason haven't already given this game a try yet, I cannot recommend it enough.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
victornatal,01-10-2021,"It doesn't matter if it's your first time playing any Zelda's game or if you're an old time player, the atmosphere of this universe is unique, the music, the characters, the places you can go. Even if it's possible for you to ignore everything and go direct to the castle, you won't! The game traps you into don't want to finish it never, there's always somewhere to explore, a new shrine, a lost korok seed, a boss in the top of the mountain...

Kyleren,03-10-2021,"This game is an absolute masterpiece, and it introduced me to my now favorite franchise of all time. The combat feels great when you execute a perfect dodge, and exploring, finding shrines, and doing side quests are super enjoyable (for the most part). The story works great, and I think that the divine beasts, while a bit boring aesthetically, are somewhat short, making them rarely drag on or get annoying, while still providing somewhat challenging puzzles. The respect it has for the rest of the Zelda series is awesome, while still providing a very new and unique experience. Some say that the stamina or weapon durability is annoying, but in my opinion, they definitely improve the fun, as you can upgrade and use stamina smartly, and you are rarely out of weapons. The physics-based puzzles are mostly well done and fun. Of course, the game isn't perfect and has many frustrating things, like framerate issues, and kinda bad voice acting, but honestly? I think that it still deserves a solid 10/10. If for some reason you own a Switch or Wii U and haven't played this game, you absolutely will not regret it. I know I didn't!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The map is massive, the gameplay is massive, the draw distance is massive - it is quite unbelievable that this game was possible on a handheld device in 2017, Nintendo definitely worked some magic here.

smartpersonz,09-10-2021,"Breath of the wild is nothing less than a masterpiece. The world itself seems to just take me on an adventure even if it has nothing to do with the actual storyline. I seem to like just making adventures within the game for myself as I tend to use the fast travel tool-less so I can explore the world and make an adventure out of every travel. An example of the emersion I've had with this game was when I found I went to one of the fairies places to upgrade new ancient armour I had just bought. Once I upgraded one of my pants I do it the next level had questions marks on it as though there was a fourth level I needed. I searched up about the fairy fountains and discovered their was one in thee gerudo region way of into the unknown but I needed 10,000 rupees to open it up to get the upgrade. I went back onto my phone and tried to find a way to make money and I found out about a snow bowling game which I had seen when I was playing the game last year. I see the next trick is to shoot a dragon for some dragon horns to sell but a long ranged bow was needed. The one mention was in a certain regions so I decided to explore their find camps of enemies with the bow and even one of those stone talius things. I still couldn't fine any so I decided it was time to fast travel. I went to the birds peoples place and the bows was just siting on the table as someone allowed me to keep it. Once I found the bow it was time to go over the do the snow bolwing which seemed like an easy way to make money. I earnt a few thousand rupee's but then left to go to the other farming place. No shrine was around so this time I needed to climb up to a point so I could camp, where I found another Stone Talius and by that time I had nearly wasted most of my arrows so the dragon didn't really matter. I went over anyway for a bit, sleeping and camping and got another few thoushdand until I had enough. This little expeditatiion took a few hours to do but unlike most game I have played it didn't ever feel like a chore or a pain to do this activities that accomplished very little as it was just enjoying living in the world of Hyrule.

The only thing that I wished that could be better (but doesn't change my rating) is the story. The story is still good for a zelda game but there could've been more to it. The reason why this doesn't affect my rating is instead of a perfect story there were side quest and other things to do.

The adventure is amazing, exploring is cool, I never knew I could be interested in a limited resources game like this. But it just works. And then it starts raining. And your freedom of exploration is instantly destroyed for the next couple minutes. Climbing is imperative to get to where you want to go and it just becomes impossible. It's a shame because even the somewhat less impressive parts (the Divine Beasts being the most common) are still well worth doing. I could talk about replayability, but I don't need to because there's just so much content that you don't even need a replay to play forever. But if you wanted to, sure, any approach you wanna take works to tackle this game.

The Zelda formula has evolved, but still pays tribute to the classic games throughout. Combat is the best it's been in the series, with so many tools and infinite possibilities. The story, however, may be its weakest point, while not bad, is still lacking more depth in characters, but this is no more than an inconvenience compared to the whole package.

I am not going to rank this game on my Zelda list just yet, as I feel like it is a lil early for that but this game has the potential to top Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess on my list!! The world in BOTW is huge, filled with enemies, puzzles with the shrines, tressure (it is nice to open these chests compared to past Zelda games, where lots of times the chests were full of rupees), and more! I love the combat system, each weapon is different and that can change how you fight enemies. Plus, the enemies in this game provide a solid challenge! My biggest complaint about the game would be the frame rate issues when docked.

It has a nice difficulty level to it that makes it challenging and rewarding. It is basically what I imagined as a little boy what an adventure as a hero would be.

thodietho,06-03-2017,"Simply put. This game is a phenomenon.

Its very uncommon these days to find a game with a plot, story, characters and everything that still says: Hey, find four shrines and then come back. Dont care how you do it, thats up to you. Later this concept gets even more insane when you have to find out where certain screenshots are taken. With this mission I try to do it before I get to the dungeons. And the fact that I can choose to DO that while other people first do the dungeons or even go straight to the final boss is something I have never seen before in a AAA title. The world is not as big as say Just Cause 3 but even though its smaller its filled with much more content. Its distracting, but in a good way.

JustABear,05-03-2017,"I wish I could give this game a 9.5, because it is not perfect. That being said, it is still probably my favorite game to be released in the 2010's, possibly of all time, but I will have to play more in order to decide that for good.
The Bad (Let's get this over with)
- Frame rate is unstable. Now I am normally a pc gamer, so any game that doesn't run at or close to 60 isn't smooth in my book. I can never call a game that doesn't run smoothly a true perfect game, hence why I want to score this game a 9.5. From my experience, most of the frame drops however have been oddly towards the beginning of the game and the towns, so it is usually only a minor inconvenience. I've manage to get used to playing the game at 30fps.
- Slow to start. Many people gush over how this game drops you into the world immediately, however this is only partially the case. Without spoiling anything there are some specific tasks you must complete before leaving the first region of the game, once these tasks are completed, you are then free to explore the world to your hearts desire.
- Some empty feeling areas. While most of the game feels full of content and neat secrets and surprises, there are a few points where it's just boring to walk around the world. That being said, I'd say that less than 5% of the game so far has been boring to me. and most of that has been toward the beginning of the game.
The Good:
- I've decided to compare BOTW to the likes of the Witcher 3 and Skyrim as many others have. The world manages to be the most free world of any open world game I have ever played. Many will claim that this game doesn't truly innovate in the open world genre, but these people are only looking at the mechanics of the game. No open world game has ever been as free as this one. The elder scrolls may let you explore from the beginning, but you are limited by the order in which you must accomplish your goals. Skyrim may be a free game but you still must complete the main quest in a specific order. The Witcher 3 may have a large world with lots of interesting characters and quests, but it is not nearly as free as BOTW. But freedom often comes at the price of polish, rewarding exploration, story, characters and the like. However, despite BOTW's free nature, it accomplishes in ALL of these areas. The story is simple overall but the characters within it and the interactions with NPC's as well as many character arks serve to improve this story. Obviously the story's not as enthralling as the Witcher 3s, but that is a small price to pay for the sheer freedom in this game. This is the first game since Skyrim that I've played where I've been able to discuss interesting stories based on my gameplay and have them be completely different than someone elses. Yet Skyrim lacks polish in it's story, world design, and npc's, unlike BOTW. Never before has a game been able to let you go to the final boss of the game immediately after the tutorial area, and yet feel so polished.
The puzzles are the best that I've seen in any open world game. No longer are puzzles based on having the right things at the right times such as the other 3d Legend of Zelda games, as you are given a majority of tools that you will ever need in the game from the starting area. It's up to you, your wits, and smart use of your tools to solve puzzles. All the shrines in the game up to this point have housed interesting puzzles at the very least. Other than the same interior design and the combat shrines, the shrines have been good over all. There are often multiple ways to solve the same puzzle, and each puzzle makes you feel accomplished when you've completed it. Some of the puzzles seem simple, but most of the simple puzzles are only there to teach you the basic mechanics of your tools so that you are not left completely blind when encountering more challenging puzzles.
- The combat, while not the most in depth or complicated is still very good. There are a variety of weapons each with different move sets that are again, not too complicated, but the variety helps you stay engaged in the combat. At it's most simple, you are simply blocking, dodging and swinging. However, there are a variety of combat quirks that you can master, such as perfect dodges, parrying, effective use of charge attacks, environmental based attacks (such as toppling a nearby tree to land on a foe), and weapon throwing. And of course you can always use a bow, or sneak your way around an enemy encampment in order to take out your foes one by one.
- The difficulty. Anyone who says this game is easy has not yet traveled far from the first area. Even when I've felt unstoppable at times my cockiness has failed my as I get one shot by a new foe. Trying to beat the last dungeon in the game with bad gear was one of the most engaging experiences Ive had so far due to the difficulty.

Noble372,05-03-2017,"I brought this game on this Switch and it is the best Zelda ever made!

Breath of the Wild broke a lot of records in the history of gaming. By that, I mean it is most likely impossible to find one thing wrong with this game. It's like Nintendo took the base of Ocarina of Time and modernize it to make it look like this game over here. This is why Nintendo will forever remain in my heart no matter where it all goes. I'm telling you this, Breath of the Wild has everything... yes, every... single... thing that made Ocarina of Time look like a masterpiece. This is the lost brother of Ocarina of Time and the true brother Ocarina of Time will ever need. Just go buy this game, it wants your money so bad, it wants you to play it so bad, it wants to be your local friend literally bad. I'll be waiting until you get this game",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aoryu,05-03-2017,"OOT siempre fue mi favorito, todo indica a que breath of the wild viene para muchos a quedar en un pedestal aun mas alto. Y es que todo es fantastico en este juego... todo tiene un sentido y un por que... Realmente una Obra Maestra!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
NinjaDave,06-03-2017,"At first I didn't think it could live up to the expectations that I had for this game but it succeeded. This really is a huge leap in the Zelda series and this is what they needed to do.

The graphics can be debated if they are good or bad but i personally enjoy the art style the same way i love Windwakers style. The soundtrack is very different to past installments. They went for a more relaxed and ambience style which works very well in this game but you do hear past songs every now and then so its a good balance and a nice throwback. The combat is really good. Not on Dark Souls or Bloodborne's level but you can parry with your shield, leap attack, charge attack and many more. As far as the world goes, I've been playing this game since launch and I've put over 20+ hours in it and every time i play it, there's still so much i have to do and it feels like playing it for the first time and I can't say that for many games. The new mechanics like the shield sliding and slow motion bow time is really cool and just makes exploring more flexible. I haven't been to into the story but it does its job in giving you a reason to do all this and you can even go straight to the final boss if you up for it. you can almost go wherever you want and do whatever you want.

In terms of whats bad about the game, the only thing i can really say that's bad is the frame rate. In handheld mode it is fine but when playing in docked mode, it really starts to chug in areas but this is mostly when you're in villages or just in the open world when walking where it has the least impact. As of now I have not had it when in combat or shrines but in terms of frame drops, the game is that good, you will just ignore it for the most part and they will probably have a patch for it in the near future.

There's still a lot more i haven't got into like taming horses, combining and cooking food, The amour you can get and colour changing, the powers you get from the sheikahslate, side quests, the weather having an effect on your exploration, tons of different weapons to use, choosing whether to upgrade your stamina or health and a ton more.

In conclusion, this really is one of the best games to come up in recent years and still shows that even with limitations, Nintendo can still make some of the best games of all time. The way I look at Breath of The Wild is if The first Legend of Zelda on NES was made today and all the sequels were all combined into one to create this Fantastic game. A must play for anyone who is a fan of Zelda or a fan of open world adventures.

For reference, here are some of my favorite games from the top of my head:
Dark Souls, Bloodborne, The Last of Us, Super Mario Bros 3, Street Fighter 2, Donkey Kong Country, Super Metroid, Yakuza 0.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DaSquyd,06-03-2017,"The Zelda franchise finally returns to its roots: open-world exploration.

daBene,06-03-2017,"What a great game! My biggest concern was that the gigantic world would be empty but nintendo solved this problem in a wonderful way.

You have encounters with npcs on the roads and can always find different ways to approach the problems you find. The greatest thing about this game are the small details and how you can work with the environment like setting some grass field on fire to give you a barrier against enemies.

Its like the series has grown along with its fans that where a certain age when A Link to The Past launched and now are adults... like me.

I'm very critical of games, even if it is of the illustrious Zelda franchise, however this game hasn't had a single thing wrong with it.

ThisIsSandwich,08-03-2017,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a fantastic game and while I would not personally give it a perfect score, I can see where it might earn that rating from others. The visuals are beautiful, the story is compelling, and the game play is entertaining. The addition of voice acting is a bit strange for a LoZ game, but it does give weight to the cutscenes it is included in although there are times where it feels a bit forced and/or awkward. For the most part, the challenges are fun, but I've run into a few fights or sections that seemed frustratingly unfair. The controls can be a bit confusing or overly complex and even ~40ish hours in I find myself pressing the wrong buttons. As for the performance, I've mostly been playing in docked mode with the display on my 1440p monitor, and there are noticeable frame drops, specifically when you're in an area with a lot of particle effects, a lot of enemies, or even a lot of foliage. It hasn't been an issue in combat (at least for me), but it has been a nuisance. Switching the HUD to Pro mode seems to have alleviated the problem somewhat, but it's still present and still very noticeable.

In conclusion, this game has its flaws and to call it perfect is a bit hyperbolic in my opinion. Still, it more than earns a high rating and it definitely feels like the killer app for the Switch. Seriously, if you have a Switch (or even a WiiU) and don't have this game, you should go out and buy it.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
crapmandingo,09-03-2017,"I found it hard to review this game. Not because it's bad, but because I loved so much about it so early on I had and am still having trouble articulating it. This Zelda game does everything right, so far. I haven't completed the game so take this review for what it's worth, nothing.

Every Zelda game is, more or less, about picking up a Sword and Shield and then saving a Princess, and this one doesn't change that up. That's about the only thing it doesn't change up. First thing I did in this game after waking up was picking up a tree branch which I used as a weapon. I proceeded to kill some enemies and steal their weapons. With their weapons I cut down some apple trees until I collected about 10 apples. I then spent 30 minutes killing enemies to get weapons to kill boars and foxes to get meat. It got late so I started catching fireflies. When morning broke I thought oh yeah, I should probably start the main quest even though I just spent a couple of hours doing whatever I wanted. Cool.

How different the game is really started after you're - *spoilers* - told to go to the first 4 shrines in the game. These shrines give you a taste of the mini dungeons throughout the game and how you can approach them however you want. One of the first shrines is located a little high up on an icy mountain. I walked towards it and froze to death, I tried approaching from another side, made it further, still frozen. Jumped in the river to swim. Froze instantly. I didn't get discouraged though because the auto save feature kept me coming right back. I finally noticed some enemies nearby with an open fire and some plants. I wiped out the multi colour orcs and picked some near by spicy plants and threw them in the hot pot and made some weird plants and cooked them. This made some food that boosted my immunity to the cold. Brilliant. I ran to the river and dived in. Froze to death instantly. Fair. Reloaded and tried again, this time I just climbed the mountain slowly and made it in. Success.

The trek changed everything about Zelda, I didn't need to get the boomerang from dungeon one to get the arrows from dungeon two to shoot the flower and put the flower seeds in a bottle from dungeon three. I saw something and decided I wanted it and figured out my own way to get it, and that's the entire game so far. I found a shrine with flowers and every time I walked on them a woman yelled at me to stop, I got tired of following the tiny path laid out so I climbed a mountain nearby, ate some food that increased my stamina and floated over to it and dropped on it past those jerk flowers. Success.

It was at this point that I realized, this game isn't holding my hand. A fairy isn't telling me I can't go to apart of town yet, or that I can't swing my sword. I don't even have a sword anymore, just a club from that GD blue Orc. Some blue **** pardon my french, isn't telling me the exact path to take.

Sitting back and looking at the game, it's beautiful and fluid. I've played some on TV and Off TV. It runs as beautiful on the Switch as it does on the TV. The soundtrack is incredible with highs and lows that seem to fit each moment perfectly. The game even does controls perfectly. Switching, natch, between Joy Cons, Off TV, Joy Cons with grip and pro controllers, it's intuitive and works.

I can't recommend this game more for Switch or Wii U, I played a fraction of friend's Wii U copy as I didn't believe him it ran as fluidly as it did. I was wrong but that's besides the point. Go play this game",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This game offers incredible liberty while still guiding you with a really good story, but you can do things in the order you want like the first zelda games. Anybody who tells there is no story haven't played the game, or haven't done what they have to do, I don't know... Shrines are a great addition and DUNGEONS ARE STILL THERE. Story is still there too, the difference with other zelda games is that you have A LOT more to do between each part of the main quest (side quests, shrines quest, exploring for hidden treasures, Discovering new monsters...) and also that you have a lot more weapons to find, and you can find them any time, not at a given part of the story.

YakusokuNoJi,06-03-2017,"A stunningly beautiful game. Not the best Zelda in my opinion (Twilight Princess as that was the game that was so good it brought me back to Zelda and made me buy BotW in the first place) but definitely one of the best. It is atmospheric and charming and even the combat is exciting. Just running around and exploring the world is entertaining and that was the intent, of course. If it would not have that much story then it would probably get a bit of a worse rating from me but the thing is that you very well have the chance too get through story, you just need to live through this game to get to know it. Basically it is a game were, in case you want to know the full story, they want you to just play the game first by exploring and then ""earn the story"" with it instead of just giving it the linear treatment. Of course you can also have shorter version of it by just going to the main villain as quickly as possible but that is not what should be done.
If a game is so great that I am happy everytime I get more stamina to cilmb even higher spots just because I can, then this is a very special game. What could be said about it that I think of as a bit negative? The music is not all that present all the time. That is a bit sad for a Zelda game. It still is there but especially for the great distances that you run or ride I would have loved to hear a theme. Bonus points for the dungeon re-interpretation theme though.

bfrposh,05-03-2017,"I really didn't want to give this game a 10/10. It's more 9.8 out of ten as the game is astonishing but it is not without it's very slight flaws.

You take Ocarina of Time level exploration and you ramp it up 500%. There is so much to do and see along with challenging side quests to keep you focused on something.

The shrine system is brilliant as you can challenge these in any order you wish and they bring back the puzzle solving of old. Familiar side quests (I've lost my cuckoos!) and characters from across the franchises many games. If i'm honest I have only really played Link Between Worlds and Ocarina of Time properly over the years so I wouldn't be able to comment and contrast with other games in the franchise but this takes elements from these games and perfects them. The game encourages you to think creatively to complete tasks and not just mash the melee button until you win.

The very very slight downside is the small frame rate drop at certain parts. This doesn't make the game unplayable but it does very slightly detract from a masterpiece of game design.

I found myself unable to turn the game off. Need to ween myself away in time for the working week!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

umo,06-03-2017,"Absolutely amazing game and one of the best if not the best in the open world genre.

Beautiful graphics in a wide variety of environments from wide open fields to dense forests, steep cliffs, mountain ranges, a gigantic volcano and beautiful view meltingly hot desert. It as much a joy to look at these varied locales as it is to explore them. And traversal is fun and varied from climbing to paragliding to horse riding across the land and lends itself to many screenshot wallpaper worthy moments to treasure forever. All accompanied by the sounds of nature and beautifully orchestrated sound track that dynamically adjusts to the locations and activities occurring on screen and kicks in the defining tracks when you are in the right place and at the right time to maximise emotional impact.

The game has a seamless open world and very few loading screens that only occur when fast travelling or entering shrines and even when they do occur they are pretty short (8-10 seconds) Aside from that you can go anywhere, anytime, from any angle...and I mean it. Feeling like finding shrines? Exploring the world? Doing Side quests? Epic battles? Go right ahead! The game lets you go wild and free after to exit The Great Plateau. Feeling some extra courage? go straight to the final boss of the game.

The world has many small touches that really make it feel alive. Villagers have names and schedules and lives where they interact with one another, go about carrying out their duties and when you interact with them they make relevant comments about your attire, their surroundings, enemies, etc. Talk to everyone, you may be surprised by what you hear.

The game has a weather system that has a huge impact on gameplay. When lightning strikes its best to avoid metal weapons and clothing with metal as it could attract lightning and kill you and Rainfall causes rocks to be harder to climb as they are slippery but will also mask the sounds of your footsteps and make sneaking easier. The weather near the volcano is so hot that wooden objects burst into flame and special gear is needed to make it through their alive. Same can be said for the Cold mountaintops and the desert features a bit of both as it varies between the 2 extremes from day to night. Best part is that you can use these systems in battle by placing metal objects near enemies and have a lightning strike wipe them out! or take advantage of the rain to sneak past them or position yourself for a sneak attack and get the jump on them.

The Combat in this game is excellent as well giving a wide variety of weapons from Swords, Claymores, Axes, Hammers, Boomerangs, Magic Rods, Bows, and Spears etc. and they all have a limited durability that raises the challenge in battle while at the same time giving you an incentive to try out other weapon types and strategise and adapt to situations on the fly. You also have a wide variety of control as you can Parry, do a Slo Mo counter attack, Sneak Attack, Throw the weapon you're holding at an enemy, Combos, Power attacks and jump attacks, and switch between your short range and long range weapons on the fly.

But Hyrule is not all blood and gore as there are over a hundred Shrines, many side quests and hundreds of small mini puzzles as well the 4 main great dungeons of the game that test your wits and understanding of the game mechanics thoroughly in puzzles ranging from straightforward in the beginning to head scratching and mind bogglingly unique. At the same each shrine some times comes with an extra optional treasure chest that tests you further just in case you thought the puzzle in front of you was too simple.

The story is also wonderfully told through voice acted cutscenes that are short and sweet and clearly define the personalities and outline key plot points to help understand what happened in Hyrule all those years ago. Although the story it self is straightforward it shines a new light and complexity to established characters and at the same time serves as a deeper meta narrative to what it means to be Zelda both as a character and as a game.

Challenging convention is main point of this game and it courageously gives the players not only the tools but also the freedom to weave out their own unique adventure on a tapestry that is daring and deep as the player wants it to be. Zelda Breath of the Wild boldly stands out among not only the Zelda franchise but open world games as a whole and stands as a testament to what gaming can be.

I would consider this the Greatest Zelda Game ever made and possibly the Best Video Game Ever made.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DanielDPD,06-03-2017,"I love this game. I miss some elements present in previous games like more complex dungeons or more variety of key items to use in dungeons. Despite the quantity of those key items, the puzzles which involves them are short but well designed and some (I've visited 27 and there is around 150) are a real challenge.

And the world is fu***** big. I've only explored the East and after playing 30h I have yet a lot of places to visit for first time. Yes, only in the east part. And there is A LOT of side quest. And A LOT of characters to talk with. And every one of those characters gives you clues of the relationships of other people and have a routine system that changes depend on the weather and the moment of the day. The world is fully detailed. Even animals and monsters have routines.

By the other hand, the ilumination used in this game is AWESOME. I think it is the most beautiful ilumination system I've seen in a game. Even more than the one used in Ghost Recon Wildlands which I've played in PC in Ultra.

In the negative side, the frame rate and popping. It is true that in dock mode the game occasionally drops the frame rate from 30 to 20, but I think is logical. The moments when thus happens is when you are in an area with a lot of grass, buildings and have some monsters attacking you. Go to the same area, in the same situation but with no grass (cut it). You won't have frame rate drops.

And I have to talk about antialiasing in docked mode. I'll be quick. I miss you!

In conclussion. Despite the technical problems, the game itself is really big and awesome, and it has a lot of places to visit and things to do. Because the iumination you will have to buy a microSD because you won't stop taking screenshots.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Tselel,14-03-2017,"Story - Of course, its your typical Zelda game with good vs evil or to be specific Link (amnesiac) vs. Calamity Ganon. The difference in this installment is that before the start of the game. Zelda lost...thats that. Nothing really interest me the whole campaign nor there was any good characterization of each and every character. Its like the game assumes you know who is who and what is and whats not. I cant say it is bad, but on today's standards...Typical doesn't do anymore. A score of 7/10

Gameplay - Now this is where the game shines. Its gameplay is great! The open world is interactive, storms gets you lightnings if you wield a sword, rain makes climbing slippery and boxed, things, etc. actually hurt when it falls on you, Fruits actually grow on trees through time. The fighting mechanics is also good, with the addition of parries and slow motion mode. Added those things with the unique and classic great puzzles of the zelda franchise. However, not everything is perfect in this aspect. The durability system is **** up that weapons get destroyed in 5-6 hits used. in fact you need atleast 20x of each types of weapons to actually not worry about losing them, next the bosses as well as ALL enemies of this game has bad AI, other than them looting weapons on the ground(which is cool btw) nothing really gives me any challenge from any of them. You just need to press that attack button and no need of actual dodging to actually beat most of the creeps ingame and lastly, the world despite being ok, is lifeless. Therefore, a score of 8/10

Graphics - Well, its cartoonish, colorful but....Its butt ugly as of today's console standards. Yeah the graphics IS decent in handheld mode, but the console is really a pain in the eyes to see. Its so outdated, the design of walls, etc. pixels are so obvious its painful. Thus, a fair score of 6/10.

Sound - I dont have any complaints with the soundtrack of the game. Its great, the intruments used are good, pleasant to the ears and soothing. The same could not be said to the character voice though, i could say the devs didnt really put any effort on that aspect which clearly showed how lazy they are in doing atleas a decent job in putting gooding voice acting to the game's characters. A score of 8/10

Total average = 7.25

First of all. Imo, seeing how HIGH this game in the critics column of the game page. I could say its really overrated. Seeing as most of the reviewers that made it where mostly likely been a fan of the franchise since they were little and that feel of nostalgia got them to be biased with the game. As for me, its not right, BOTW IS A GOOD GAME, but no way in hell it is a masterpiece. The game doesn't really did any revolutionary in its gameplay to consider it a ""best"" nor its story is that engrossing too as well its graphics and environment ist really that good or anything. IT IS JUST A GOOD GAME WITH A ZELDA TITLE. hell, i think if its another title an d without ""zelda"" in it then this would be averaging 70-75 in the metacritic. regardless, i gave what i feel a score that shows what the game is to those potential buyers. Is it worth it if you have a switch? well, you dont have a choice since its the only decent out there. But imo, wait for more good games to come out before buying switch.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ligaea,06-03-2017,"Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a game that will be remembered for decades. It's not only the best game to launch with a system, but more than likely the best game ever made. The Switch is worth buying for this game, and this game alone...even if the Switch never gets another title.

There's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before, but this game has been designed with unbelievable imagination. The landscapes and scenery are well modelled and crafted. The enemies behave very differently without pattern. The wildlife behave as wildlife irl do. It has some very deep survival elements and I'm always having to decide how to approach an enemy before initiating a battle. The climbing aspect is a blast and gives you a rush after reaching a peak on your last stamina potion. The loot system and treasure hunting is extremely rewarding.

The best thing of all is of course the freedom. Do anything, anywhere, anytime. It's a true adventure game with no map icons or hud headers to make you feel stupid and take up screen space. The controls just work and the sound effects and music are extremely aesthetically pleasing. Menu systems are designed for ease of use and visual attractiveness.

As for cons, there are frame drops and some shrine puzzles lack any hint to a clear solution. That's really it. I think the 98 critic score reflects my own opinion of the game. A nearly perfect game that can appeal to an extremely wide audience. My wife even loves it and she never plays anything other than platformers or Mario Kart. The game isn't for everyone...but I think it does appeal to people who even don't normally like Zelda games. It's an absolute masterpiece.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

BouncingBest,14-03-2017,"Before you lose your minds, understand this is a good game and it's worth a purchase if you enjoy Zelda and I love Zelda, it's my favorite series.

With that said - Breath of the Wild tries very hard to be a modern open world Dark Soulsy meets Skyrim kinda game but the mechanics cause it to fall on it's face. One hit kills are a thing. Lock on isn't as easy to use as before. Weapons are as durable as icicles on a hot summer's day (unless in the enemies hands, they never break then) until you have grinded hours and can get better ones and the promise of ""do anything you want, BotW says YES"" comes with the fine print of ""as long as you have the right gear/food/hearts/stamina/amiibos/etc"". The Pay To Win amiibo aspect is also predictable but disappointing. Be warned that things like getting Epona via Amiibo comes with the fine print of ""if you turn off your game or don't stable her, it never works again"". Also be warned the strategy guide seems to purposely be missing things like amiibo functionality which is unforgivable and should be there to prevent things such as having to restart due to losing Epona.

So with that out of the way, let's talk about the positives. This game is beautiful. The world is beautiful. Finally being able to scale mountains is amazing and the fact that you can take your time and do numerous side quests or just explore instead of being stuck in the main story is a huge improvement. Cooking your own elixirs and food can give you a near limitless supply of health, stamina, and other items so you don't need to worry about purchasing them or having the luck to find them. There are so many great things that were added to this game that it's a shame the bad mechanics and flaws bog them down. This could have easily been a truly incredible experience, not a 10 because few games are that perfect, but at least a 9.

If you love Zelda, buy this. Don't be afraid of the Wii U version if you can't get a Switch, there isn't a huge amount of difference. If you're not into Zelda, then this is probably a skip. Other games did open world better and those will be more to your liking but if you feel little tingles of excitement every time you get a new chance to adventure with Link like me, you want this - flaws and all - just because it's Zelda.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
prohobo,24-05-2017,"If you're reading through reviews wondering if everyone is insane, then let me tell you that this is the review I wish I had read before buying the game.

It's just as boring as you think it is. When people say that there is 'so much to do' they mean that you can do the same things, over and over again, a lot.

* The puzzles are boring and/or annoying.
* The exploration is fun for about 10 hours (meaning that it IS genuinely fun, but it gets old if you're looking for any kind of depth).
* The story is cringe-inducing.
* There is no depth beyond the exploration, combat, and the crappy puzzles (shrines). Those three things are what you cycle through endlessly until you get tired or you decide to beat the game.
* This isn't really Zelda, not at all in it's ideal form.

If you consider Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask works of art, or 'experiences', then you will see right through this game. I'm not saying you won't like it, I'm just saying that you'll know exactly what's what after about 30 minutes.

Now, gripes out of the way: This game is RELAXING. Play it if you want to just do random stuff all day in Zelda-land and sometimes impress yourself with your ingenuity, find cute things to giggle about, and just kind of mindlessly 'do something'. The game, however, is not worth investing your imagination into, there's nothing here. It's a theme park.

A solid 7. Good sand-box toy/game, bad Zelda experience.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

adrii9715,06-03-2017,"The presentation card ( The legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild) is almost perfect for Nintendo Switch*. Now I'm going to talk about what are the positive points and the negatives for me.
*I say that it's almost perfect because, I think that there is not a perfect game yet. If the score could be decimal, I would said 9,5.

Pros:
-Very interesting story. The more I play the more I want to play.
-A lot of secondary content and options. The map is huge and there are a lot of things to investigate and figure them out. There are a lot of enemies and weapons, interesting puzzles, new abilities...
-Link is still incredible. New design and now looks like a young men with a tale to tell.

Negative:
- For the actual generations, Nintendo should have given a step forward in graphic aspects. They are OK, and I don't say that they should have work for HZD or uncharted 4 graphics. With this graphics level, the minimum would be the 60 FPS.
- If I said that there are a lot of enemies, now I want to say, that I want more, because a lot of them are the same but with other weapons.

jgonterman,05-03-2017,"First of all, I would like to address the fact that people who are giving this game a 0/10 haven't played it. Do NOT let them troll you because they are fanboys of another system, and don't want to see a game getting better than ANY reviews their exclusives have gotten.

A little bit about me : I would like to state that I am a Zelda fanboy. I won't try to make you believe anything different. I have beaten 18 out of the now 21 main title Zeldas (Phantom Hourglass and A Link Between Worlds being the two I never beat nor played). So, although it seems that I could be biased, I'd like to think of it as I am seasoned, and know my way around a good Zelda title.

Now, onto the review (20 hours in) : THIS GAME IS STUNNING. The soundtrack is at it's best, up there with OOT and Wind Waker, in my opinion. The Gameplay Mechanics are amazing. There is no game out there that utilizes so many mechanics in ALL the right ways. From the best fighting we've seen in Zelda, to the climbing, swimming, flying, and more, this game is amazing in all facets of gameplay. The physics have to be the best of any game I've ever played. From weighted objects rolling down hills, to flying feeling actually reasonable, to aiming the bow feeling realistic, to the weight of items slowing you down, you won't find better physics ANYWHERE. The graphics are top notch. Some give it a knock because it is not ""photo-realism"" like Horizon Zero Dawn. First of all, Horizon isn't (I own it), and Zelda is not meant to be like that. It is heavily Japanese animated, and this is the best form of it that I have ever seen. If you want to see it at it's best, watch videos showing of the grass. In my opinion it is even better than Horizon. The story is FANTASTIC so far. Trust me, I was in the group of wanting to disown voice acting in Zelda, but they pull it off really well. The whole game isn't voice acted like so many thought, just story cutscenes, and I think it brings even more life to an already stunning game. The sheer storytelling itself is great, and every time I put the game down, I canNOT wait to get back on and progress!

Those are the outstanding aspects of the game. So, does the game lack? Are there any faults at all!? Yes, but hardly. There are subtle framerate drops, although I've only noticed this in the mobile mode, not once on TV mode. The gyro controls should be optional. There are a few shrines (no spoilers) where gyro controls are necessary, and I find this dumb as the puzzles aren't hard to figure out at all, it's just forced gyro. I would have much rather seen a hard mind puzzle like Zelda is greatly known for. That being said, those are the only negatives I can speak of so far. I'm being serious. The ONLY ones. This coming from a fan who can be VERY critical of Zelda games.

Now to the most important aspect of ANY game. The experience. On paper, this game is perfect. You can tell that from any review. Is the gameplay/soundtrack/graphics/etc. good? Well, it's AMAZING. So what about the FEEL of the game? It's perfect. This game has been knocked for influences of Assassin's Creed and Skyrim, but that's what makes it so great. Yes, you can argue those influences, but that's what makes it so great. It grabs minor influences from some of the best RPGs of all time, and culminates it into an original Zelda experience, that in my mind creates the best game that I've ever played. Anything you think you can do in this game, you can. For example, I was getting pissed off at this apple on a tree that I couldn't climb too. So, I shot an arrow at it. Subconsciously I thought that the arrow and apple would disappear like it probably would in any game, but then the apple with the arrow fell on the ground, and I was able to pick up the apple and retrieve my arrow. Yes, it's subtle, but it blew my mind. The smallest things will grasp your attention in this masterpiece! If you drop a torch on the ground, grass will set aflame. If there is wind, it will affect your arrows. The game truly immerses you in it's world and it feels GREAT! On another note, I've never felt the sense of exploration and freedom in any other game EVER (this coming from a nerd who put over 1,000 hours on Skyrim). If you see anything in this game, you can get there. That's what is so amazing about this game. I got side tracked by 2 hours climbing up a mountain just for kicks, and when I got to the top there were unexpected things to my surprise that I would not have known unless I climbed it! This game is captivating, and everything I do feels like an adventure!

I haven't played a game like it, and I can't wait to put 100 hours into it, and then hopefully 100 more! If you have a Switch, this title is a no-brainer. If you have a Wii U, and don't plan on buying a Switch, this title is a no-brainer.

In short, don't listen to the haters. They're jealous of the closest to perfect a video game has ever been. In my opinion, this is the best game I have EVER played.

ukvfjkd,06-03-2017,"It's crazy how many 0/10 reviews there are from people who admit never having played the game!
There are some frame-rate issues when playing on the Switch, but that is my only complaint. The game feels simultaneously new and nostalgic, and it is breathtakingly beautiful. There is so much more content than any past Zelda game, which is both wonderful and a bit overwhelming for people who are used to 100%-ing Zelda games.
The game really captures the feelings of adventure and discovery that are the hallmark experience of Zelda games. The new features (cooking, climbing, magic, quest log) are great, and I don't miss the removed features of old games (heart piece hunting, fishing, loud music).

RadioboyMeta,07-03-2017,"Each meter of the mapping of Breath of the Wild, every moment, is full of adventure spirit and substantial activities that give more depth to the history and universe of the video game.

Never before a game had such masterful balance between mechanics and narrative. That is, all the playable options it offers (magic, physical powers, buried places, etc.) have a why, a reason to be within the story.

Never before has a sandbox style game given such freedom when it comes to traversing the map. The only limits are your experience (both stamina and hearts) and the things the world gives you (armor, shields, clothing, ingredients, metals, ...). Only you decide how and when.

In Breath of the Wild you will not spend a second without doing something substantial and fun. It is the ultimate open world game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Naggischnulu,06-03-2017,"(First of all sorry for my bad english)
In my opinion Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game of all time. You can read many very negative and positive things about the game online, I want to talk a bit about them.

I've played 7 hours so far, I don't know everything about the game, maybe this game gets worse.
One negative point is the open world, which is ""too huge and too empty"". I can't confirm that, maybe I'm very curious but everywhere is something to explore. There are many monster camps, many forest with special items and many shrines. There are also ""villages"" and sometimes there are people you can talk to. I didn't played games like Witcher 3, but I think the world of Breath of the Wild is not empty.

Another criticism are the shrines - shrines are very tiny dungeons. I can understand why people are complaining about it, it's just nothing compared to the dungeons in other Zelda games, BUT there is one problem. NOBODY PLAYED THROUGH THE GAME. The release was three days ago. I can't give the game zero points because there are no dungeons or the world is empty - this is just ridiculous! In my opinion you have to play the game several hours to find reasonable criticisms. So in the end there are the common criticisms: The world is empty, there are no real dungeons, the weapons don't last very long. I can understand these points, but is this worth it to give the game 0-2 points? I've got the feeling many people want to get the score low, maybe the metascore is too high? I don't know, but this game is NOT bad!
I have very much fun with the game and after playing 7 hours I can give a score of 10, in my opinion it is the best Zelda game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Robban,07-03-2017,"A challenging and incredibly well designed game, filled with innovative content, polished to perfection. 10/10.

After about 20 hours of game time, my experience is that the game is a strong contender for the best game of all time. The vast open world is well thought out, and with thousands of little things to do. You need not run in a straight line, the option is completely yours, and there is little-to-no handling - yet you always feel taken care of. The learning curve of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is not steep, but it is long, and in a good fashion. This game can be played for tens (if not hundreds) of hours, and with every hour you will still feel the wonder of amazement and discovery.

Boss fights and dungeons are intuitive and new. The transition from open world game play into dungeons is as seamless as you could ever imagine. AI is strong, and with many fun little details in NPC behavior. Overall, the attention to detail throughout the game is breath taking. Zelda has evolved, and in doing so it has reached a new high. Nintendo's experimentation with this striking new role play experience hit home, and immediately became modern classic.

If you at all enjoy open world sandbox games, adventuring, and the freedom of choice that was Zelda's essence of old: Do not miss this game, you will love every waking moment you spend playing it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

HeartThrobinson,12-03-2017,"Good: This game explores open world in a brand new way that hopefully other triple A games pick up on. The way Link moves around and explores the map from climbing to custom map markers makes this world more open than any open world before it. The map is bigger than Skyrim and smaller than the Witcher 3, but it is the only one where 100% of the maps surface is explore-able, thanks to the mechanics of exploration.

Te combat is interesting and makes you think more than past Zelda titles. You can't just charge into a battle with even smaller enemies and expect to live. The world is full of things to do, and the biggest problem with completing objectives is how easy it is to get distracted on your way. The funny but sensible cartoon physics make the game more interesting.

The NPCs are all super interesting, and dialogue with them is snarky and funny. They also act like a regular village or explorers and make the world feel alive.

Bad: Despite how excellent an open world game this is, it did make mistakes.
The destructible weapons mechanic is one you can get used to. But that is the best I can say for it. It doesn't really add much to the game. It gets you to try more types of weapons, but there are only about 5 types and worrying about breaking your good ones actually locks you into using your worst and least enjoyable weapon most of the time. They could have included the varying weapon system and allowed people to keep the best weapons they got and achieved the same effect.

The cooking mechanic is kind of fun for the first couple meals you cook, but then it gets tedious. They should have used it exclusively for stat buffing, and left in game health recovery and buy-able health potions, so only those who wanted to cook a lot had to, and no one had to spend twenty minutes preparing their health recovery items.

Zelda does dungeons better than any other series out there. There are plenty of great dungeon crawlers, but none of them have the unique, beautiful, puzzling, and epic dungeons the Zelda series is famous for. This game does away with that.

There are few dungeons, and they are all short and have a bland, brown aesthetic. They combined could have made a single dungeon in another Zelda game, and not a very interesting one.

They used shrines, mini-dungeons, to address this. The problem is the shrines also have a consistently boring aesthetic, and aren't that interesting either. I completed every single shrine in game, and maybe 10 of them had interesting puzzles. The rest of the shrine puzzles were pretty obvious, and more designed to show of the game mechanics than to puzzle you. On top of that a huge chunk of them was just a repeat of the same three kind of boring fights with the same slightly varied enemy. An enemy that could have easily just been an over world enemy.

The side quests are almost all just fetch quests. There are a few really interesting and fun ones, but overall they are kind of boring, and most of the interesting ones are just a shrine in disguise.

Shrines end up making up for what the game is lacking in both dungeons and side quests, and while they are cool on their own, they are not enough to make up for either of those things. They at best can replace the over world puzzles that led to getting heart pieces before, they serve the same purpose and have the same length and difficulty. So they took three of the best parts of the series and tried to bundle them into one inadequate mechanic. If the shrines were put together you would have enough content for just under two dungeons in this game, including all of the actual dungeons.

Concerning other reviews: Yes, this is getting extra high scores because people are on a New Zelda high, and that will die down eventually. However anyone who has tried the game obviously knows it isn't a zero either. These people are just petty and for some reason offended that a game which isn't their favorite got good reviews.Ignore those morons, and don't believe people who overpraise it either. In a few months they will stop being so hyped up they can more accurately assess this game.

Its great, but could have been much better. This game does the worst thing you could to a lifetime Zelda fan. It gives you the craving to play Zelda, but it doesn't satisfy or meet that craving. This is mostly because of the lack of interesting dungeons and in depth side quests.

I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MediaFreak,21-03-2017,"This game is not perfect 10, but its much better than a 9 so I'm having to round up.

This game is like no other zelda game that has come before it, personally I've never been a fan of open world games baring the GTA games, as they're usually just big for the sake of big. But with breath of the wild exploring it is more fun than the actual story itself.

The main quest is fairly poor by zelda standards, the plot it very generic, the traditional pre boss dungeons are simple and dull, and all 5 bosses don't requite much skil, just the right equipment. I don't think I ever quite figured out the perfect dodge mechanism or the timed shield block.

The fact that I'm praising this game inspite of that should tell you how good the rest of the game is. The huge ammount of shrines create some of the most memorable moments in gaming I've ever experienced. The lack of hand holding and how quick the game starts is refreshing, the combat is great, (not quite as inventive as skyward sword, but much less frustrsting) but most importantly rhe game creates a feeling of adventurousness that I haven't felt since I was a child. Never has a single player game felt like such a multiplayer experience, if I'm not playing it I'm sharing stories with friends about our unique experiences and the adventures we've been on. The pokemon go phenomenon is the only other experience within games where i've encountered this before.

The only sad part is, I'll probably never play a better game again.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

A game this good doesn't come around very often. I haven't had this much fun with a game since... I can't remember! Perfect 10 from me.

godo,06-03-2017,"This is a Zelda unlike any other, yet with familiar elements to it. Nintendo managed to create a huge open world and yet keep it interesting at every turn. Though exploration is a major mechanic, it always feels rewarding to do so, discovering the many delightful surprises peppered throughout the map.

Yet, it never feels unguided. With other open world games I ended up feeling lost and like the game had forgotten about me, which made me give up on playing them entirely. Zelda feels like it gives me gentle pushes and hints in the right direction so I never feel without purpose, without being patronising.

The game makes you work for everything. Don't expect to be handed anything on a silver platter. Want a weapon? Better go fight some monsters and take theirs. Want a horse? Go find a wild one and tame it yourself. Yet, this never feels like a chore, especially as there are about a million ways to achieve anything.

Well done Nintendo, I hadn't felt this way about a Zelda, or any game actually, since Ocarina of Time. This is about the highest compliment I can pay a game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Orizon,07-03-2017,"Don't mind all those 0: no intelligent being could ever think of such a rating for BotW.

Wanna know the only flaw in BotW? Graphics look *technically* outdated due to poor texture filtering, objects pop-in and some FPS drops here and there.

BUT ALL OF THAT REALLY MEANS NOTHING.
1) Graphics look *artistically* AWESOME, you'll feel like living inside an AAA anime most of the time.
2) Gameplay mechanics are simply the best ever, both combat and ambient interaction: a nice and natural learning curve really drags you into the game.
3) The world is huge. I mean, really huge, also vertically. And while huge, it's also full of stuff, creatures, touches, puzzles, and overall feels alive and funny.
4) Great storyline brilliantly narrated and integrated into the game: just the right cutscenes at the right times. Then, just action, freedom and more things to do.

BotW has only a REAL FLAW: I think it will make me like and play way less games in the future, because it really set a new standard for open world RPGs.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Screedledude,06-03-2017,"Simply put, an amazing game. Challenging but not overly punishing, meaning a Game Over is a learning chance and not a punishment. Weapon durability is a divisive feature, but I feel like it helps prevent you from being stuck to one weapon style for 100 hours. The puzzles are great, simple yet rewarding, reminds me very much of Portal 2. The world is full of hidden secrets... never before have I played a game where exploring always feels FUN rather than just going past an obstacle.
Any issues I've had have been with the Switch and not the game (e.g. the analog sticks aren't precise enough for aiming on occasion). I would implore you to BELIEVE THE HYPE; even if you don't care for nintendo and it's 'gimmicks', you have to appreciate that a game like this is a rare gem.

A delayed game is eventually good, but a rushed game is forever bad."" I am so glad they chose to go with the former.
In summary:
ZELDA: 10/10, my only issues are with the controllers themselves, no fault of the game. Switch is a 7/10 for me.
THE SWITCH: 7/10. A few motion control issues; the portability is amazing, everything is decently executed, but I very much feel that 'first gen' vibe from it. Can't wait for the Switch XL Pro Plus four years down the line.
I recommend Zelda: Breath of the Wild wholeheartedly; but, as an early buyer, I would warn you to be wary, and consider buying the Switch when it's on sale (likely christmas) so that it has more games and is more worth the value.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ubermonkey88,17-07-2017,"I must admit I've never been a massive Zelda fan over the years - I've enjoyed some of the games but it's not a series I've been mad for. However, with the hype surrounding this latest installment, I thought it's time to dust out the Wii and have a go! After playing through it, here's my thoughts from a neutral standpoint!

The Good

Given the Wii U or Switch can't compete with PC or other consoles from a hardware point of view, Nintendo have done very well to create a distinctive style for this game, and I think it works very well. Sunrises and sunsets are pretty, character models are well designed and the landscape is nice and varied. It's a cartoony style that I think works very well.

Combat, although basic, is grand. There's a variety of melee, ranged and magical weapons available and encounters with groups of enemies or strongholds include a degree of strategy or planning required. There are some annoyances though, which I'll mention later.

The inclusion of shrines was a sore point for many but I enjoyed looking for them and completing them, especially as each shrine gave you a token to use toward increasing your heart containers or stamina. Some are very short and simplistic but the majority of them are well thought out.

The Bad

The open world, although well designed and very pretty, can be a bit barren at times. There are very few major settlements throughout the map, aside from a handful of villages and stables to rest. I found myself spending too much time running across landscapes looking for something of interest, only to find very little.

Combat, although quite good, does have it's issues. Firstly, the lack of variety in enemies means it can get repetitive very quickly. Secondly weapon degradation is an issue. Many have pointed out this to be a minor annoyance, however I disagree. There's nothing worse than finding a great weapon only not to use because you don't want it to be destroyed after 3 hits. It takes away from the enjoyment of finding weapons. Also, during battles it's incredibly frustrating to have a weapon break and have to pause the game mid-battle to change it. It certainly helps break the immersion of the game.

Story is something that is an issue for many open world games (The Witcher 3 and Red Dead Redemption being exceptions), and BOTW is no exception. There's a story in there somewhere, but it's very bare bones, and the open world format takes away any urgency of the main quest - ""Please Link, you must get to Castle Hyrule as soon as you can and help Princess Zelda!"" ""Sure, but after I find 300 Korok seeds and all 120 shrines, then we'll think about it"".

Overall, BOTW is a very good game, and is worth playing if you have a Wii U or Switch (well if you have a Switch, you've already bought it!). However, it's not the best open world game out there, and i fear that the very high scores are a lot to do with the fact that it has ""The Legend of Zelda"" tacked on to it. There are definitely much better open world games out there (Witcher 3, Skyrim, Horizon ZD, Red Dead Redemption, GTA V) but again, it's faults aside, it is worth playing and is an enjoyable game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Svenne,06-03-2017,"First of all I actually played this game from start to finish on Nintendo Switch. So I believe I can say something that makes sense. I'm not a fan of open world games. I had the Witcher 3 on ps4 and I sold it after playing it for a few hours. So I was scared to start this new Zelda game. But all my fears were not needed. It has a huge map for sure and it has good variety of dense and open spaces. Some people will dislike the open spaces but I love them, The world looks beautiful but the game suffers from some frame rate issues. It's not a huge deal in my opinion but it is noticeable when playing docked. Also the textures, especially on some rocks, look kinda stretched. But I have to say that these 'flaws' don't take anything away from the experience and for me, the experience, is the most important thing.

This is a real Zelda game. It has an amazing story, awesome music, memorable characters, collectibles and you have more freedom than ever before. This game has a user score of 7,6 as of March 6 and That's far too low for this game. The hate and disbelieve is pathetic in every way. Haters gonna hate of course, but believe me when I say that this game is worth your time. JUST HAVE FUN!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I think this is the perfection, a masterpiece that has everything in it : perfect gameplay, nice storytelling, the most beautiful and fun-to-travel open world, musics that will be in the memories for decades.

Thank you Nintendo, Thank you Aonuma-San, this game is really for me the BGE. Never felt this since Ocarina Of Time came out.

jerr888,07-03-2017,"As soon as I started my journey in the new world of Breath Of The Wild, I immediately fell in love with it. This amazing game is filled with content I would never have thought to find in a LoZ game such as the battle mechanics and cooking. Breath of the Wild has a giant variety of lovable characters, beautiful music, and a giant, gorgeous land that keeps on giving new places to explore. The amazing story and capability of doing what you want makes you want to restart the game as soon as you complete it and revisit and experience it all over again. This new addition in the Zelda series is by far my favorite and is now my favorite game of all time. I have already put about 50 hours into this game and I will probably triple that number in no time.

My 9 year-old imagination ran wild, but was always restricted by the limitations in the actual game(s). Those limitations are now gone. Your imagination is now the limit. Graphically, the game looks like a beautiful piece of art has come to life. Every time I turn a corner, I am stunned at the beauty and detail.
Every other Zelda game now seems quaint by comparison.
I am a huge LoZ fan but didn't care for most of the games in the last 10 years, mostly due to weird control gimmicks that didn't work for me. My expectations for BOTW were extremely high.

HOW then, can 977 give this masterpiece a negative score? I'm all for opinion, but the negative scores are bordering on butt hurt jealousy.

As a gamer that has become disillusioned with the electronic gaming industry in the past few years I was eagerly awaiting this game with quiet trepidation. OoT and ALTTP are two of my favourite games of all time, but having played countless ""must-have"" games of the past few years - looking at you The Witcher' - and then being thoroughly let down by what I saw I was beginning to think 'Breath of the Wild' would further let me down and that I may be coming to the end of my gaming life.

Imagine then to my my surprise, that 'Breath of the Wild' has thoroughly reinvigorated my love for gaming and given me trust that games can still surprise you with wonderment and excitement.

Everything from the gameplay, story, open world, shrines and quests have been painstakingly crafted with loving devotion by one of the best gaming companies ever created. Nintendo have not only outdone themselves, but they have made clear and and reiterated their main ethos of progressing gaming first, power later. Gaming should be fun and exciting, full of wonderment and awe.

S0urceC0de,07-03-2017,"First things first, all the negative reviews? Just ignore them. They are all either butt hurt Zelda fans that cannot adapt to change who wants everything linear and loves to be guided by the hand throughout the entirety of the game who have no real grasp on an open world environment nor even want to OR they are the usual trolls that love to bash every new entry in the Zelda franchise for reasons unknown (either childish and immature or its taking attention from the gaming scene away from their Playstations or Xboxes). Giving this game a score of ""0"" or even below a 7 for that matter makes absolutely no sense to me. So, pretty much what those reviews are saying is that this game is on par with Superman 64 on the Nintendo 64 which is widely regarded as one of the worst titles ever created. Uh, no...I don't think so. Perhaps these people need to have all their games taken away and stripped of the title of ""gamer"". Now to the game:

It is absolutely amazing and HUGE. Those complaining that the environment is ""unfinished"" or what have you are simply wrong. You can do just about everything in this game and interact with just about everything, something that is lacking in most open world games. This is the first Zelda where I have actually felt the ""want"" to explore every nook and cranny. Just because the world is vast unlike your Grand Theft Auto and there is more ground to cover doesn't mean the world is empty. Do me a favor and go out into the wilderness in the middle of nowhere (in the real world) and you will see that the similarity is uncanny. I have been a fan of Zelda since the original (yes, I am that old) and I can tell you, this is the first one that really makes me feel like I am going on this huge journey to save Hyrule. Not to steal away from Harley Davidson but ""it's not about the destination, it's about the journey"".

And don't get me started on the weather in this game. The weather plays a role unlike any game before it. If it rains, good luck climbing that steep rock face. Lightning storm? Better not be wearing anything metal or be in combat with broadsword. You are more than likely going to get fried. The rain also wets the ground so when you are going downhill riding on your shield all snowboarding-like you will travel a bit faster. In this sense, the weather has essentially become a strong ""character"" with this Zelda. It is mind-boggling the amount of depth that is in this tiny little cartridge (or disc if you are playing the Wii U version).

The game runs fairly smooth. Those complaining about framerate are doing nothing more than grasping at straws to find something negative about this title. Sure you MIGHT find a choppy frame here and there but ultimately, if and when you do find a choppy frame, it does very little to detract from the overall experience. A game like Skyrim, just for comparison's sake, was a buggy mess when it released back in 2011 and got a user score of 8.1. Where is the logic here? This only proves that trolls really do exist and what spews from their fingertips at the keyboard is nothing more than immature ridiculousness.

While playing Breath of the Wild, what I have found is that for the first time in any title I have ever played, I feel like this is a world that really exists and that I am apart of. You can look to the sky and see birds flying, you can see the clouds and know if bad weather is coming, you can see every blade of grass, there is wildlife all around you and the music is absolutely astonishing. While the music only accentuates certain moments in the game, it does this on purpose to make you feel like you are really in this world out in the wilderness and on this massive journey. Sadly, this game comes to an end like all good things. I say ""sadly"" because this is simply a game I do not want to end. I will certainly be playing through again upon completion of my first runthrough.

I can go on about the many things that make this game great but honestly you can find that reading every other review. Overall, I really feel like the changes made for this entry were much needed in order to keep this series fresh and relevant. I do not believe that Zelda could have survived using the same old bag of tricks and mechanics that helped define this genre when Ocarina of Time came out in 1998. My only hope at this point is that Nintendo rolls out more DLC to take advantage of this beautiful world they created because it would a downright shame to let it go to waste. What would be even better is to use the assets they created to create a new Zelda title altogether.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kubinashi,06-03-2017,"This game is big, this game is huge, this game is great!
I wouldn't compare it to anything like Dragon Age, TES or even The Witcher but I think it's one of the better RPGs in the last months.

But what is that great that everyone loses their mind?
For me it's the big and beautiful world Nintendo has created. Yes, you have to climb on towers to discover the map BUT! where in other RPGs you get a ton of question marks or points of interest there's in Zelda nothing. Just the map, that's it.
You have to discover everything for yourself and I like that. If you think that something might be important then you have to go there and manually place a marker at the location.
You get a tutorial at the beginning, yes but it's just the basics and everything else is just your will to discover the game and the world alike.

Another point are the graphics. Where some people are disappointed I'm very happy indeed. It's nothing compared to Horizon or The Witcher but the style and the artwork are very beautiful and I don't mind if it's a bit unpolished. Some more AA would have been a good thing but it's totally fine for me.

The story is well written. The dialogues have no voice over but the cut scenes. I think that even for someone who is new to this franchise that you get a clear picture. They introduce the world, the people and something that happened in past Zelda games very well. Even the German voice over is quite good. One of the best I ever heard.

What I also like is the difficulty of the game. You have weak NPCs who are just there to be killed but you also have hard hitter quite early in the game. This means that every hit you get could be your possible death.

If I like this game that much then why is there just a 9 and not a 10?
Well, it has its flaws.
The main thing for me is the starting area. You have some tutorials and stuff but you don't have many NPCs. It's kinda boring and when you get out of this zone you just hope that it won't be your entire journey.
Other than that are very fast breaking weapons. Depending on your weapon it breaks faster or slower but it will break sometime for sure. I think it's a bit too often. On the other hand you find new weapons behind every corner and you can loot everything which monsters have equipped.

Well that's it. I hope this review was helpful for you.

BabelLion,03-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild for Nintendo Switch is not only an amazing Zelda game, it is an amazing game in general. While it does forgo ultra realism with graphics for a cell shaded look it is truly stunning. The sky box is beautiful and the draw distance all for you to view miles of wilderness. It is honestly breath taking.

The combat is tight and fun. Their are some challenging bosses but if you are patience and come with a plan you can work your way through them. The ability to load up the game and instantly do whatever you want is a big departure from the rest of the series. The character design is unique and they have enough personalities that you want to pay attention to cut scenes.

I did the day one update before loading up the game and I have not had any serious frame rate drops in TV mode or handheld. What it all comes down to is I love this game.

DeViLzzz,15-03-2017,"Here is why Zelda Breath of the Wild is not a 10/10 game -

1. Frame rate (FPS) .... abysmal at times dipping below 30 which is totally unacceptable for this sort of game.
2. Copy and pasted towers all over the place that you need to go to. I couldn't believe Nintendo couldn't do better than that.
3. A bad camera where you have no options to change things.
4. Enemy AI at times is pathetic. Enemies staying up in towers when it is clear they are getting nowhere firing at your with arrows from there and also even when they see their foes dying they don't come to their aid.
5. Stamina meter
6. Weapons breaking all the time for so little use. What in the hell was Nintendumb thinking?
7. The game on the Nintendo Switch barely looks better than the Wii U version as only a few simple lighting effects add more glare which is actually blinding at times so there may be players that don't even like the so called extra graphical feature.

ETC. ETC.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
KesslerCOIL,15-03-2017,"I'll start off by saying I am keeping this review as honest as possible and 6/10 is NOT a ""bad review"", the game is good but the faults I've encountered just sorta chip away at the fun for me.

The combat is simple, but varied and I've found myself using a large variety of weapons, however not by choice. The weapon degradation (or rather fragility) is something I cant bring myself to forgive, especially with how severe it is, the basic trash weapons I can understand breaking quickly, but if I find a weapon with solid damage that is (relatively) hard to find then it should last more than 8 swings. This constant fumble for weapons and inventory management isn't fun for me and breaks up the combat way too much, alongside forcing me to decide if an enemy is even worth breaking my weapons on.

The visuals are beautiful, though I found my frames dipping a lot in bad weather and mountains. The art-style is minimalist, but not simple and the physics in combination is pretty damn impressive for a game on a hybrid handheld console..

The story I feel could have been great, but I found digging for breadcrumbs rather tedious and wishing I got to see more of the other characters. Some of the characters I honestly wish I could play instead of Link, they seemed more interesting, deep and fleshed out.

The world is expansive and deceptively large, expanding more and more as you play. The stamina meter often puts a hamper on the experience until you've invested time into increasing it's size however.
The enemies are probably the biggest highlight of the game, they're interesting, cute and truly feel like they live in the world around you, often times they're interacting with things in a way I wouldn't expect from a nintendo game.

Overall, the game is pretty damn good if I must say so, but the glaring things in the game like excessive weapon degradation punishing players at every turn, stamina nagging at you for having too much fun and the constant dips in framerate (yes, even when docked) made for a rather taxing experience that didn't start to feel tolerable until I was very deep into the game.

6/10, stop putting weapon degradation in games.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Daveman,07-07-2020,"It's admittedly been a LONG time since I've owned a Nintendo home console, much less had a Nintendo game that enthralled me enough to worthy the purchase of a system. The last one I've owned was the Gamecube, but since then I've been wary of the Wii and Wii U. While both systems were fun and had some great games, neither really sold me (Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 were veeery close).

On Friday, that all changed. I bought the Switch and Zelda together with the pro controller with very high expectations, and a slight fear of having buyer's remorse because I didn't want a shovelware system. But the first couple hours I sank into BotW, not only did my sense of dread dissipate and my expectations were met, the game itself left me in complete awe. People that have already seen the gameplay videos already know what to expect, and yet to actually experience it yourself is so thrilling. I lost sleep last night because I brought the Switch in its portable mode with me to bed (I thought it would annoy my wife, but she was just as fascinated with it as I was).

About 10 hours into the game and it still feels like I just dipped my toes into the massive ocean that is BotW. This is the mark of a truly great game: Hours pass by like minutes, and it still pulls you back in to discover what else is in store. It's going to be quite a while before I see myself moving on to another game.

Very few games deserve a top score, and with that said, even a 10/10 feels like it's just expected for a game of this caliber. (Note I do not believe 5/5 or 10/10 means a game is perfect, but it is indeed a masterpiece that was made in the pursuit of perfection.) Nintendo has proven once again they have mastered the craftsmanship of developing a fine game, one filled with so much wonder and imagination, and above all else, so much fun. I'm happy they've focused their efforts more into the elements of what made the Zelda series such a fantastic and memorable franchise and pushing it in the direction of open world fantasy adventure that we gamers have painfully wished for, instead of gimmicky trends (cough Skyward Sword cough).

If you consider yourself a gamer, gaming enthusiast, anything along the like, you owe it to yourself to play this masterpiece. To see and feel virtual art come to life. To experience the wonderment Nintendo developers have created for us. To disregard the game because of fanboyism or blind hate for Nintendo is to only deny yourself a fantastic product that was built specifically for you with tender love and care. In fact, looking at the 1/10 reviews from people that haven't even played the game is rather sad. It's like a child throwing a tantrum because their parents bought them a plate of gourmet restaurant macaroni and cheese, yet they'd rather have microwave cheesy mac.

It's true that the game is not perfect: there are occasional frame drops and the inventory and weapons management could be better, but overall the experience is so overwhelming that you forget everything else. It's a true masterpiece that gets inspiration from previous titles of the series and other open world AAA games in a perfect mix. Recommended",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Wizardography,04-03-2017,This is the Zelda game I've been waiting for Nintendo to make. This game is full of unique experiences and incredibly deep gameplay that stays fresh even after 60hrs. I'm still finding things that surprise me and new ways to interact with the world. I can't wait to see what Nintendo has up it's sleeve for next time around.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
sd11,04-03-2017,"SO 700+ negative scores from people who have supposedly played the game, mostly all posted on the games release date of 3rd March, for a game that takes 50-100 hours to complete.
Now just for information on my review I have not yet completed the game, so my score might alter. But I have put in 30+ hours already and there is still a huge amount left to do. This game is that good that in only 3 days I have played 30+ hours worth.

The shrines start off easy, but soon become challenging. The puzzles grow in difficulty and the combat trials soon get hard. There are supposedly over 120 shrines to find during the game.
Next the size of the world is daunting. It is absolutely huge. It starts off a little empty with only random enemies. As you venture into the game random large monsters appear, some very difficult to defeat. A single blow is enough to kill players with minimal hearts. As you explore further afield the game becomes littered with a greater number of monsters that simply want to kill you.
The atmosphere and dynamic weather is phenomenal. If it rains, suddenly you can't climb the same slopes. Venture too far into the cold with the wrong clothes and you will quickly perish. But you can overcome some of these effects by cooking potions and learning recipes. This game has the same level of excellence as Ocarina of time. It starts off a little slow, but after completing the first 4 shrines soon takes off. My score of 10 is based on my enjoyment of the first 30 hours of play. I would disregard any 1st day reviews, whether positive or negative because this game is so huge that I do not believe any of these people could have truly played it unless they had early access.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

QuantumPelican,05-03-2017,"Firstly, I'll start by addressing some complaints I've seen in negative reviews of this game:

""There are no dungeons.""
Yes there are. There are 4 dungeons, accompanied by a myriad of shrines.

""It's too easy/hand-holdy.""
I'm sort of baffled by this one, and all I can say is that is that the people saying this must not have engaged in any exploration whatsoever. A lot of the main-quest and areas around towns, etc. contain relatively easy puzzles and fights, but if you take the time to leave the beaten trail, you'll probably come across a fair challenge pretty quickly. Reviewers who specifically mention hand-holdiness have clearly not played nearly enough of the game to piece together an educated review.

""The music sucks.""
A quick read through of comments in this vein shows that the actual meaning behind this criticism is that the music is different. Music plays a different role in this game than it does in previous titles. Here, it gives the game a bit of flavour and atmosphere rather than blasting the player with overt, repeating musical themes. It's fine to not like the music in this game, but it's useful to note that a thorough playthrough of this game will be far longer than the typical 20-40 hours of previous 3D Zelda titles. It's likely, given enough play time, that catchy, repetitive themes in the context of this game would end up being incredibly grating. As it is, there is a clear emphasis on the environments here and the use of music to simply enhance the mood set by the environmental sounds works extremely well (plus there are some really great musical moments where music is present).

""There's nothing to do.""
There are over 100 shrines to discover, a bunch of sidequests if you look in the right places, over 300 unique photos to take in-game, and a number of diverse and engaging areas to explore. I'll concede that if you don't enjoy exploration, this game isn't for you.

""It looks terrible.""
It doesn't have the best graphics on a technical level. It's low-res by modern standards, with some pop-in and frame drops, and it could do with a bit of anti-aliasing, but the game's art style stands out from its technical limitations, as was the case in The Wind Waker, and even Skyward Sword to some extent. The frame drops are a a fair complaint, however I haven't found this factor to have any effect on gameplay since they mainly occur in places with a lot of NPCs, which tend to be less timing-sensitive areas. They do occur in forested areas quite a lot, but this isn't an online FPS, and not every frame is critical in combat, to be brutally honest. It's a valid complaint, but I don't think it's a big enough issue to make this particular game less enjoyable by any significant measure.

That's pretty much every complaint I care to cover. Now for some reasons to like this game, rather than reasons to simply not hate it.

1. Combat/Gameplay
The enemies in this game vary significantly in difficulty. Some are extremely easy to beat, and areas of the game that have high proportions of these enemies can begin to feel a bit too easy after a while, but what's interesting is that the combat never gets boring. The combat in this game requires a lot more strategy to deal with than in previous titles and keeps you on your feet since dodging becomes a really important aspect of swordplay. Coming off a 40 hour play-through of Twilight Princess HD, this a breath of fresh air to me as enemies have different attack styles that require adaptive strategies, unlike in Twilight Princess, and these strategies are often based around your fundamental moveset rather than gimmicky items and gameplay mechanics (I'm looking at you, Skyward Sword).
Speaking of which, the basic controls are surprisingly deep for a game of this nature. Hours in, I was still learning new things about the controls. It could be argued that the game not teaching this to you from the outset is poor design, but in my experience, these elements are unnecessary for the progression of the game, and I'd argue that it's a plus that the early game doesn't get bogged down in tutorials or hint panels.

2. Shrines
The shrines can be divided into two categories: Combat and puzzles. The puzzle shrines have a wonderful amount of diversity, though they are not all particularly challenging. As stated above, the more isolated or out of the way a shrine is, the more likely it is to pose a challenge. The combat shrines are pretty homogeneous, but a lot of them pose a really great challenge, taking the aforementioned combat mechanics to their limits. Some of these shrines feel like dedicated boss arenas, and it's a lot of fun to employ all the strategies you've accumulated up to these shrines in defeating their enemies.

3. There's a great sense of progression in this game, even without an experience or leveling system.

4. I have reached my character limit. The game is great.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

j3lack,08-03-2017,"Largest open world I've ever enjoyed, I've heard people complaining about it being empty but honestly have they played it?

Yes the graphics aren't photo realistic but they are beautiful and except for when i'm looking at the water color clouds i'm fully immersed in this game. The ubiquitous shrines more than make up for the limited dungeons and the Sheika Slate is way better than limited bombs and having to unlock items before you can reach said area like in OOT.

Tenks,14-03-2017,"Legend of Zelda BoTW what is there to say about this game that hasn't already been said. Its a huge open world adventure game that puts you in the shoes of the hero of hyrule yet again.

Pros: Open world
Lots to explore with the shrines and side quest
Voice acting
Hours and hours of content.

Cons: This may be me but if feels as if it spikes in difficulty to fast
Weapon durability is way to small this is a big sticking point for me
Finally Dungeons there are only a hand full and they are short I guess you
could say that it was balanced out with the shrines but they could of used a
little more for the big dungeons.

Thoughts: Should you play this game? Yes I recomend this game whole heartedly. It is a good game just has a few design choices that make it feel more like scavenging game than an adventure game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
eaboo316,16-03-2017,"I have super, super mixed feelings about this game. To provide some context, I have grown up playing games from Japanese RPG series, and I only play JRPG's mostly because I know I'll enjoy them, and there's too many games in the world to try with too little time, so I limit my choices to games I know I'll love - games from the Legend of Zelda series being one of them. I am also pretty flexible with the games I like, the FF series has changed their gameplay style almost every game, and besides the online games, I've played and enjoyed all of them. So, I have played a mix of open-world and linear games, and tend to prefer something in the middle.

Before I delved into BOTW, I decided to play and beat Wind Waker HD to get myself reacquainted with the Zelda series before this game, because the last time I played a Zelda game was Skyward Sword in 2011, which I loved. And I loved Wind Waker as well. I knew this game would be a bit different with an open-world concept, though I have played similar open-world ish JRPGs before, so wasn't too worried. Though, almost 20 hours put into the game, I did not feel the same level of engagement that I immediately felt with Wind Waker just a couple of weeks before, and I decided to pause playing it.

The story is not as engaging as previous titles. While the previous games pulled me in right away, I felt like I was trying to hurriedly get through the first four shrines in the beginning of the game just so I could get to what was happening. And this is the main issue I have with this game. As someone who appreciates a good story and character development in a game, the benefit of exploring a vast, virtual world in order to do so, is not appealing. I also enjoy doing side quests in JRPG's, and try to do all of them. But the side quests in here hinder me from progressing to the main story, and reap rewards that aren't very helpful. I also tend to hoard items and weapons whenever I play, and the fact that weapons and shields have to be thrown away or broken at some time, really bothers me.

I love the graphics and the character design, the world is quite beautiful. I liked how the runes are incorporated and can be used pretty flexibly (though would lead me to mostly try to use bombs to kill enemies because I didn't want a sword to break or arrows to run out -_-). The method of taming horses is cool too. For me, the fun kinda stops there though. I play games to destress from the difficulties of the world, and just kick back and play through a good story, and on the contrary this game stresses me out. @_@ A virtual world can be too vast for some people, perhaps.

I think I will try to beat this game at some point, but the excitement that I usually feel for a Legend of Zelda game isn't there. I could just be becoming a dated gamer (hopefully not, in my mid 20s here), but I miss the intricate dungeons, the different tools (hookshot, boomerang, etc), and most especially the engaging story and lovable characters. I think this game is more appealing to those who play Western RPGs more, though I hope the next title in the Zelda series tries to attempt a more universal appeal and mixes both linear and open world storytelling (maybe something like Xenoblade). If not, I think I will keep to re-playing the older games, which is fine with me, and stick with new games from JRPG series that release games that creatively build on their previous games without needed to transform it completely.

I'm glad most people are happy with this game and perhaps are even getting introduced to the Zelda series for the first time (because it's an awesome series!! Go to the LoZ concerts!!). Though for me, this is just an okay game outfitted with the Zelda name (did not mean to make that rhyme, but it came out well). There is not much really besides the names of the characters and typical Zelda items (master sword, boomerang) that make the connection with the rest of the series, and if these characteristics are swapped out, no one would know this is part of a series, and that's really disappointing to me. For now, I'll put it down and use my destressing time to play the recently new entry of another JRPG series that I am enjoying, and get back to this one later.

Overall, if you are like me and like JRPG games that put a lot of emphasis on storytelling and character development and have fun gameplay, this may not be your cup of tea. Though if you love open world games and exploring virtual areas with little direction to go through the story your own way, and don't mind doing tasks in video games w/o incentives, then you will most likely enjoy this game.

Whichever type of gamer you are, how well you enjoy a game is ultimately up to you, and don't let others push you down for what your opinion is, whether you love this or any game or don't (my wise words after reading forum discussions that are virtual war zones w/ words).",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
revillo,11-04-2017,"This is an enormous game that functions well as a casual handheld experience. Pick it up whenever and kill a few hours running around its theme park mmo style world. Solve a few shrine puzzles, clear out some monster encapments, finish a quest, see what's on the other side of that mountain etc. It's your run of the mill RPG experience, but with stunning draw distances that let you see clear across the gargantuan map, and somewhat novel climbing and paragliding mechanics that help you get around.

It's easy to be blindsided by the scale of the game, but after spending a few dozen hours grinding through it, I'm finding myself a little baffled by the perfect scores. The essentials here are weak, from the dark-souls-for-children combat mechancis, the ability to heal yourself whenever in the middle of combat with essentially limitless potions, puzzles that telegraph their solutions so blatantly you don't feel much reward in completing them, and maybe worst of all, an awkward, gaping void where a story ought to be.

There's fun to be had for sure, especially when you find some novel way to play in Breath of the Wild's coherent but gimmicky physicsy sandbox, it's just that little charming quirks don't add up to a deep gaming experience. The expertly polished, pitch-perfect game design i've come to expect from the series appears to have peaked with Twilight Princess. I'm genuinely happy Nintendo is flexing their engineerig muscle and taking some big risks with a change to the formula, but I hope they make a smaller, more concentrated map next time and fix this game's clunky controls and shallow components.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Zidane_Mina,06-03-2017,"I've been playing games for the last 24 years (Since i was 4), and this is the game i have always dreamed of.

The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is the first true open world game in the series, and it sets a benchmark not only for upcoming Zelda games, but all open world games in general. The amount of wonder this version of Hyrule (the name of the land) brings is otustanding. There's never a dull moment while traversing the landscape, and the amount of sigths is incredible huge: from pretty vallleys filled with flowers and greens, to hellish volcanoes, perilous deserts and freezing mountains: it's all there, and everything blends perfectly.

Gameplay wise, if you're a veteran 3D Zelda player, you'll have to unlearn everything you've learned over the last 2 decades, this entry mixes up things a little: no longer does Link auto-jump gaps, there's a dedicated button for that. Your weapons break, you have to change them at the middle of the battle or procuring new ones either in the battlefield, looting them from enemies or finding them on the wild. Is sorta like a mixture of Dark Souls and every other eastern action RPG.

Storywise, Zelda has never been this epic in scale and dramatic yet heroic on execution, and the game last however long you want it to last: the story has good pacing, interesting characters and a very (very) satisfying ending.

Graphics are incredible, though with some little problems here and there (bad anti-liasing and some frame rate drops, but nothing too serious, (no really, they happen veyr rarely), but the artistic style is pure bliss: the amount of color and life put into this open world is outstanding, and it makes every other open world out there (except maybe, Dragon Age Inquisition) look dull and boring in comparison.

There's not a single thing i can complain about on this game that hinders the overall quality and awesomeness Nintendo has brought to this franchise. Nintendo has looked over every other open world game out there and surely thought for itself ""i can do the same, but better"". Experienced players will surely identify things that other games did before this (Assassin's Creed, The Witcher 3, The Elder Scrolls, Dark Souls), but Breath of the Wilde took those elements and made something special out of it: like a recipe for perfection). At the end of the day, BoTW may not be the biggest open world out there, neither the most dense with side activities: but it is, beyond any doubt, the most fun open world game i've ever played.

Breath of the Wild has become the best game i have ever played, and in a world where i also played the everlasting awesome games like Bioshock, Red Dead Redemption, Dark Souls, God of War III, Bloodborne and The Elder Scrolls, that's one hell of an accomplishment.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

josei1985,24-03-2017,"Zelda Breath of the Wild es un grandísimos videojuego que sin tener los gráficos de la actual generación es realmente bello. Cuando estamos en la cima de una montaña o en una torre y nos lanzamos con la paravela nos damos cuenta que estamos ante un espectáculo visual. Y si coincide con un amanecer dejaremos la misión o lo que quiera que estemos haciendo para observarlo.

Es un juego que te atrapa, donde estaremos horas y horas que se pasarán en un suspiro. Podrás jugar seis horas seguidas sin darte cuenta, sin apenas avanzar en la historia principal o haciendo apenas un puñado de misiones secundarias o superando santuarios. Más de 105 horas tengo a mis espaldas tras habérmelo pasado.

Los detalles según lo que hagamos, las físicas, son sin duda una lección magistral para otras desarrolladoras. Ver la hierba moverse según sopla el viento, como ésta va cediendo a nuestros pasos, cómo podemos cortarla cuando está alta y pueden aparecer animales que hacia un rato se había escondido a nuestro paso, cómo nos cuesta escalar cuando llueve (todo cuanto veamos es escalable, según la resistencia que tengamos), cómo podemos quedar achicharrados si en una tormenta de rayos vamos equipados con nuestro escudo/espada, el movimiento del agua cuando estamos en ella, poder cortar árboles al golpearlo ver cómo se deslizan si hay pendiente, la IA de los enemigos al eliminar o devolverte las bombas que les lanzas, ,... Alguno le parecerá una tontería pero no muchos juegos atienden a estos ""detalles"".

No hay mucha gente con la que charlar salvo en postas y aldeas y los que nos encontremos en el camino nos podrán dar pistas de tesoros o lugares que hasta ese momento no hayamos tenido noticia o puede que se conviertan en enemigos. En las aldeas, lógicamente, no hay muchos edificios pero en todos ellos podremos cotillear, sin excepción. Lo cual deja a otros mundos abiertos como una decoración de cartón piedra.

A continuación les paso mis puntos negativos:

- Poca profundidad en la historia y escasas misiones principales. Eso sí, las cinemáticas son muy bonitas y bien hechas.

- Quitando postas y aldeas, poca vida (humana). La interacción con estos poco profunda.

- Misiones secundarias decepcionante. El héroe de Hyrule reducido a recadero: tráeme X gemás luminosas, X setas raudas, etc. o busca a menganito que no sabemos dónde está. Ni rastro de misiones secundarias tan buenas y con tanta enjundia como una principal, que vimos en juegos como The Witcher 3.

- Sistema de combate ortopédico (hasta que con el paso de las horas vamos puliendo, pero es malo). Venir de jugar Nioh y encontrarte con esto.. cierto, no son géneros comparables, pero deja mucho que desear la simplificación del combate.

- Dificultad del juego. Nula. Nula para jefes finales de las bestias divinas y Ganon. Si no estás pendiente de la vida, si no tienes flechas ancestrales o no cuentas con la espada maestra, puede que te cueste. Si tienes todo eso, prácticamente a la primera los vencerás. En cambio, los guardianes pero especialmente los centaleones son muy complicados. Lo curioso es que son enemigos opcionales. No tiene lógica.

- Algunos tirones en modo TV, no molestos, pero siendo exclusivo es imperdonable. También el último día me hizo una cosa extraña en modo portatil, auqnue aquí el juego es estable y se ve de lujo. En modo TV jugando con el mando pro gana muchísimo.

- Esto es más subjetivo: tras 105 horas y con estos puntos negativos, no entiendo tanto maldito 10 de la prensa. Maletines?

I do not like the design of open world games that chase a lot of icons. Of course, the legend of Zelda also has an icon indicating the destination. But that's not enough to disturb adventure and make you feel like working.

This is exactly adventure.

Go up a mountain, find a shrine, and glide in a different place. Go to the unexplored place, meet occasionally Kolog. The enemies in the road are very stronger than the previous series. I devise how to fight and make it through.

I was truly impressed that the sound environment matches time and space. The ascending air current by the flame and the physical calculation are wonderful, but it is a spice for directing the world of Breath of the Wild. Of course, rising air current can be used for para-sailing, wow.

It is pleasant to fly in the sky in a world that is still too vast. It is fun to climb up a vertically elevated cliff. I think whether this enjoyment can not be tasted by moving only on the ground.

Combat is OK once you get the hang of it and weapons breaking ""all the time"" slows down as you get better gear and progress, it's not as much of a headache as weapons drop from pretty much anything you kill. Major gripe is FPS drops and overall smoothness in TV mode on the Switch, it does occur but not too often; in tablet/handheld mode the game is buttery smooth most of time, I haven't been pulled out of the game once in handheld mode due to FPS issues.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dontdothatmkay,08-03-2017,"One of the best games I've played in a while! if you own a Wii U or Nintendo Switch, BUY THIS GAME! it has been the most fun I've had since I went to my friend's place as a kid and played N64 for hours. This game totally deserves a 10. Idk why people are so butt hurt about it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kirby2049,08-03-2017,"Be warned that the Negative reviews for this game are just Nintendo haters trying to tear down an amazing game. Let me start with the nid-picky stuff to get it over with. The motion controls for some of the shrines may be off putting (you can turn off the motion controls for the bow), if you are looking carefully you can see pop in but since the game is rendering mountains across the massive map it's expected and anyone complain about this, especially since you don't notice it much if you aren't looking for it, are making too big a deal about it. And finally the lack of customizing controls, I noticed this right away when the run a jump button were not next to each other. Non of these things should cause a drop in score, especially when the rest of the game makes up for it. Now to list off the pros: The game is beautiful, it's like an art piece you play in. It doesn't hold your hand with anything, It will tell you some basic stuff but other than that you must figure out things on your own, and you will based on the direction you take. The platauo are is the tutorial but doesn't feel like one, as soon as you get the paraglider you can go anywere you want, even if it means getting yourself killed. Leading to my next point, this is the hardest mainline Zelda game to date, there are enemies in the starting area that can one shot you. It is a survival game so you have to hunt and gather to get your harts back, and it's very rewarding. In fact everything you do in this game feels rewarding because you are the one who choses to do it without anyone forcing you to. Want to climb a mountain? Bam you go climb it, when you reach the top you look around and bask in the beauty. Or maybe it's rain and thunder that you are basking in, the realism and new physics engine are amazing, you can actually be struck by lightning if you are carrying metal, and not just you but enemies as well. Fires spread and the rain can put out fires too. Weapons, Bows and Shields can break now so you must manage your inventory, but not to worry because you can increase that space with those korok seeds if you find the right person. Speaking of shields, you can shield surf down slopes, and wow is it fun. There are lots of side quests to do and tons of hidden things to find. Breath of the wild brings back horses in a big way, not only can you tame and register multiple horses to use but you can name them and change their manes (including some colors), bridals and saddles. Breath of The Wild feels like Nintendo took lots of great aspects of every Zelda game, crammed them into one and made it better. 10/10 this game is going to truly be a legend among games.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bigsky154,08-03-2017,"It has been a long time since I have played a game without being able to put it down. There is so much to this game. For Zelda fans looking for a game with the usual formula, you will be disappointed. This game take Zelda in a new direction but I believe it is for the better. It is a great game alone but the fact that it is part of one of the greatest franchises ever, makes it that much better.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Caneofsomaria,09-03-2017,"I had very high expectations for this game, and it still managed to surpass them. I have been a massive Zelda fan for 15 years - and this game stands tall amongst the best.

The vastness and beauty of the open-world, and the constant exploration through the wilderness is a feeling I have not had before from a video game. The freedom this game gives you is almost overwhelming. There are distinct Zelda elements throughout - familiar items, races, mechanics etc - but there are also complete fresh reinventions to the series that have not been done before, and it is here, I feel, that lots of the negative reviews are coming from. Don't get me wrong - everyone is entitled to their own opinion - but I personally feel that doing a few things differently is not a bad thing - every Zelda game has brought something different to the table - why not this one too?

People have complained about the music - whilst I agree there aren't as many catchy melodies as there have been previously, the new, gorgeous piano driven music trades ""catchyness"" that for an incredible atmosphere - and I feel sorry for those who can't enjoy what this style of music is bringing to the game. People have also complained about the exploration being slow - but for me, I find it enormously satisfying, turning over every leaf and finding all the secrets the game has to offer. Another complaint people make is that the weapons break - whilst frustrating at times, it adds an entirely new survival mechanic to the game.

I suppose what I'm saying is - depending on your personality and patience - if you take the things that make this game different from other Zelda games and embrace them (rather than complain about them) - then this game stands to be Zelda perfection alongside the great Ocarina of Time.

I would also like to praise the storyline and voice-acting which is brilliant and completely fresh, yet fits perfectly into the Zelda universe.

My only complaint would perhaps be the lack of classically colourful, unique-looking, sometimes claustrophobic Zelda dungeons (though I do really enjoy the new shrines!). I still give the game a 10, because taking this into account, I'd give it a 9.6 which is still rounds to 10.

Really take caution with the negative reviews, they are very subjective - I feel you get from this game what you want to. I am so happy with this game, it is a true epic.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Eylul,23-05-2017,"You are basically travelling, visiting, cooking and helping people for hours and hours because fighting break your beloved weapons, story is not that immersive, shrine and korok seeds grinding is repetitive and main quests too less to make it a great game.
I hope upcoming DLC will breathe some more life into it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
paulthehanna,14-07-2017,"I don't understand all the 10/10 reviews. I finished this game today. It was disappointing from the start. I've played and enjoyed Ocarina of Time, Link to the past, Majora's mask, and many other legend of Zelda games, so I have some experience of the series.
The music is dull, the graphics are nice but ultimately do not make up for the sparse storytelling, the uninspired game-play and the scaling of difficulty. Worst of all, this game does not live up to the previous series in terms of solving the dungeon puzzles. I didn't enjoy unlocking shrines.
The first few hours are excruciating. It can take up to 10 hours for the game to pick-up and then the reward is minimal. After climbing this starting requirement, the game is actually too easy and the final boss was pitiful.
Everyone praises the huge open world but most of is empty. They have taken an ordinary Zelda game and stretched it out. In fact, this is an apt metaphor for this game. The game may be longer, bigger and so forth - but this isn't matched with story elements, interesting characters, or enjoyable game-play - this game lacks depth. Every Zelda game but this one has hooked me from the start by making me care about the characters, having strong story elements, and rewarding puzzles (i.e. getting a cool new item as you complete a dungeon). Finally, the game lacks many of the enjoyable quirks that characterise the Zelda series.
I look forward to these things being rectified in Breath of the Wild 2.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Broxs,05-01-2020,"Last time I felt that way, was while playing The Witcher 3. You have a great story with well-written characters and also unique fight mechanics and also puzzles. I wasn't really a fan of most of the shrines or even the Divine Beast. But all fights felt really epic and sometimes you needed to use some special items or things to survive. BotW is my number 1 RPG, because even The Witcher wasn't that good!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Braduk,15-09-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a decent and mostly fun open world game, but it is missing a lot that would make it a good Zelda game in my eyes.

-- For starters, it suffers a lot of the problems that a lot of other modern open world games do, where the content is stretched out quantity > quality type content. Skyrim has a lot of dungeons with copy-pasted aesthetic and radiant repeating quests for example. A good chunk of Breath of the Wild's content comes from having 100 shrines with a copy pasted aesthetic, fighting the same enemy outposts, and having 900 koroks to find (a task that, really, no one finds fun and is really tedious). This is the bulk of the overworld's content. So it ends up feeling kind of lacking. Especially when, other than a handful, the shrine puzzles are really easy and not that in-depth, and when you have 100 of them and only a handful are somewhat difficult, that's not a good ratio.
Another a problem that comes from it being open world is how barren the overworld feels at times. You go through large expanses of just, emptiness, too large of expanses, even. And there's really no places to explore or discover other than shrines and koroks. There aren't any unique secret or interesting areas to find. It's just, well, kind of bland.
The point being the actual content that is in the game is just overall not very engaging, innovated, or unique, despite what everyone claims.
-- Outside of the problems that come from it being open world the other main issue is how much it lacks of core Zelda aspects and mechanics. Dungeons have always been a very big part of the series, especially dungeons where each one has its own theme. Breath of the Wild only has four dungeons and all of them share the same theme amongst them. In addition to that, all the dungeons are also really easy and not memorable at all.
Along with reused dungeon aspects comes the fact that the bosses are all literally the same. They're all aspects of Ganon and other than different elements behave the same. This is a big downside in a series where boss fights have always been a focus, as well, and the series has a lot of memorable and unique bosses in it. Breath of the Wild does not have that. Another memorable part of the series is the OST. Most of the time playing Breath of the Wild is spent with no music outside of a few clicks of a piano, the OST is really only in towns and other similar places, which is a shame, really.
-- The last and probably most impacting missing series staple is having a large variety of equipment and items at your disposal. Breath of the Wild has tons of breakable weapons to use, but they all bubble down into one of four categories, and outside of combat melee weapons there's not that many different items in the game. There's no hookshot or pegasus boots, two items that'd make for VERY good later game upgrades, there's no ball and chain which would have worked perfectly with the combat system, there's a lot of series staple items missing and it really is a shame, because it would have helped liven up the gameplay having more toys to play with. Instead Breath of the Wild has probably the least amount of items in it out of any 3D Zelda game.
-- Breath of the Wild does some things right. The story is good, though the story is also not there that much. The characters are for the most part also good. The new species designs are great and other than looking washed out at times the game has a decent art style. But there's so many flaws in the game and there's so many elements of a good Zelda game missing that it boggles me that it has such perfect reception from the masses, and it's disappointing that there's so much missing when the base idea has so much potential.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BinsF,08-03-2017,"I have not done many reviews, but this one deserves it. This game is a masterpiece. I finish all the main quests this weekend and now I'm going for the 100% until Mario Kart comes out. Although it has changed a lot from other Zelda titles, it is still a Zelda, and one of the best. I sure miss some stuff like old dungeons and the old way items were introduced to us, but you realize this are small details after you play for a while, and you realize you don't need that to have a great experience. It is for me the SECOND BEST ZELDA GAME so far.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ZachGrubes,17-03-2017,"I have never written a user review, but feel compelled. I have been playing games since the Eighties when I first played Space Invaders, Tetris, Super Mario Bros, etc. I have played most of the Zeldas to completion. Because I've been playing games since the glory days of Sega vs Nintendo I have a soft spot in my heart for Nintendo games specifically, but I also play other games, COD, Portal, Assassins Creed, GTA, Minecraft, etc. I also play tons of indie games because I think small-time dreamers making games in their basement deserve to have their games played, they are often of incredibly high quality considering what scarce resources they are made with. I've played a lot of games. I do not think it is unreasonable to make a statement such as ""Breath of the Wild is the best game I've ever played"". I would not be alone if I did. Many people have made statements such as this, and not just user reviewers, critics. It is telling to observe that actual critics have rated this game much higher than users. When this is the case, you can tell something is much better than users are saying it is. Many of the user reviewers admit in their review to not having even played the game. I would posit that, generally, critics are better equipped to assess the quality of a game than caustic, sweaty palmed children who spend all their time swearing at people over their X-box live account, while racking up head-shots. Most critics are fairly impartial and will try to give a fair, objective review. It is telling that of the nearly 100 critic reviews perhaps only 3 or 4 score it less than a 90, the vast majority are perfect 10s. The lowest scores are around 70. Three outliers scored it near that area. To score a game of this scope, this grandeur, a game with this much charm a mediocre score just seems like their may be axes to grind there.

Play this game. If it's the last thing you do!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

TripleMoonPanda,01-03-2018,"So I wanted to actually play this for a while before I left a review so after about 40 hours I think I'm ready.
Massive open world with great variety of environments and weathers. The survival aspect is superb.. The climbing mechanic they added was also a really nice touch and made exploring the world just that much better. You see a mountain and you're like ""I wanna go and climb that mountain and see what's up there"" and you can do every bit of that plus some. The story is good, not great but much better then the past couple of Zelda games. Side quest are also good, I think they could've improved more on these though. A lot of them seem kind of shallow and also I feel like there's not enough of them scattered threw out the world. A bethesda game like Skyrim or Fallout 4 feels like it has a smaller map but they feel that map with many memorable locations and more quests that are more fleshed out then BOTW, and I'm not even going to compare side quest in BOTW to side quests in the Witcher 3 (honestly BOTW can't compete with the Witcher 3 in this aspect).
Dungeons. . . I really would've liked to see more large scale dungeons like in previous Zelda games. The 4 main ones are really short and really easy. I was honestly bored with them. I found many of the shrines to be more challenging then the 4 main dungeons. Oh and about the Shrines, sure there's a bunch of them (100 to be exact) and I like the aspect of completing these shrines for increasing your health and stamina to be a nice addition but I still would've like to see fewer more challenging shrines. The dungeons and the shrines I feel are really not all that good and I would much rather have the old large challenging dungeons in place of these.
Weapon variety in this game is great but another big negative for me is the weapon durability mechanic. This is just annoying, weapons break far to easily and you can't repair any of them. It feels like fake difficulty because you have to keep picking up crappy weapons and use them and you don't get to keep any of the cool weapons you get besides the master sword. I would've like to see a much more indepth durability system with crafting and repairing and also make metal weapons last longer then the sticks. All the weapons no matter what they are seem to break after the same amount of use. I get like 3-4 hit's with a stick and with a metal sword it feels like I only get 4-5 hits before it breaks and I have to use the freakin stick anyways.
Now on to performance. . . Performance on the switch is really unexceptable. Constant frame drops and only 30 fps. 720p resolution that actually drops down lower when playing in handheld mode and only 900p which also can drop when docked. Now this isn't really the games fault but the fault of the switch. I like that is portable but they really could've put more powerful hardware in the thing (plus WTF Nintendo only 32GBs of storage unless I shell out another $50 - $70 for a 128GB Micro SD card) after getting tired at the crappy frame rate while docked, I actually ended up downloading Cemu and running the game threw that with some mods that let me play it at 60fps and a resolution of 1440p which made the visuals look much, much better. Oh and visuals that's another thing I understand the switch doesn't have the power to do it, but the visuals look like a game from 2011 and not 2017 luckily the fantastic art style and weather system really make up for the lack fancy graphics and effects.
So all in all I rate the game a 7/10 it's really good but not as good as everyone will have you believe, I consider the Witcher 3 a 9/10 and compared to that game BOTW sits at a solid 7. One piece of advice I would give you guys is if you actually OWN THE GAME and have a decent gaming PC then download Cemu and play it there instead of playing it docked on the switch. If you wanna play it on the go then the Switch is a great/only way to play.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Yhatha,25-03-2018,"Zelda botw is the best switch game I've played by a long shot and may even be one of the best games I've ever played in the first place. The worlds are so open and expansive, and discovering a new place is so satisfying or getting a really good item. This game truly feels like a completely open world and the replay value is splendid. There's 120 mini dungeons called shrines, all giving you a challenge to complete weather that's fighting an enemy, doing a puzzle, or just plain getting to the shrine itself is sometimes the challenge.

The combat is also really intriguing and being so complex but simple at the same time. Unlike other Zelda games, you don't just target and enemy and spam attack. You have certain moves you can do like flips and parry's which are super satisfying to pull off. Also weapons break, so this makes you more destined to not be constrained to one weapon all the time and explore to get more.

The tutorial in this game doesn't even feel like a tutorial. It's very good at teaching you what the game has ahead of you but somehow not feeling watered down and boring. It's like the first super Mario, it does it in a way by making you learn yourself.

I could talk about this game for hours, but the rest i'll say is this is a must have for switch owners, and Nintendo fans alike.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

jeremyMcAlli,07-01-2020,"Ok, so I'm not just giving this a high score because Zelda is delivering some fan service... But it helps of course! Normally never care but the fact that he can be shirtless throughout the entire game, and the characters react to it (""Oh you're so... in tune with nature!"") makes me giggle.

I had never played Zelda, and am always a bit wary of Japanese games with their respect to representation of women. I am barely into the game though and I'm hooked. Cannot put it down. And I love the way the piano comes in to say hello briefly and leave again whenever you're wondering around. The blood moon also scared the brollies out of me. Very very impressed.

My bones of contention are that it is marked on the map where you died and the food. With the former, I understand it's to warn you of any big monsters who's path you crossed, but it feels like a stinking mark of shame. With the latter, it's a tired trope of Japanese media to make everything about food (apparently this started in the 90's). The original pokemon games never had it, the original Final Fantasies never had, now EVERYONE is cooking and eating yummy food, and oh how it is soooo yummy... I'm bored and frustrated by it. It's a societal distraction that is doing Japan no good. Food is a great way to understand the other, to experience life, etc... but well climate change may destroy that opportunity soon enough, so maybe the media in Japan could present the opportunity to think critically about some things?

The worst part of all that should kill it for most people is performance; if we would ignore that 720p 30FPS is unnacceptable on 2017 (or 900p with bad performance), the game has unnacceptable fps drops and a graphic style that while it is unique, it isn't impressive at all.

TULFrich,06-03-2017,"When we talk about today´s game developing standars we all know the big N always choses a different path. Breath of the wild not only improves as it should but it takes all what has mae the franchise so succesful and mashes it up in a masterful way. It all takes off in a traditional way of unraveling Link´s story and it´s past events, a 100 yeas ago to be precise, but instead of taking the usual linear or semi-linear path, it just leavs you out on this massive open world to explore and to survive as you get usual RPG elements like weapons and other gear.

The game itself is gorgeous in watercolor artstyle, but don´t get me wrong, it is not just an artstyle for hardware ""limitations"" but a style this itteration of Zelda that managed to nail all it´s details on an intriguing way. As far as the game goes in terms of processing power it has a lot of things going on even on the portable mode tof the switch, and a lot of times you can get beautiful sceneries with particle effects going on, an excellent physics engine, weather conditions, etc. It´s scale is just massive, and mostly if you can see it you can reach it, even on large open areas where nothing appers to be going on, the pure scenery and music gets you the chills of a relaxing spot leaving behind all the frantic things that are going on, and it is truly appreciated. Even animals behave in natural ways. And, damn!!! the music on this game is just masterful, check it for yorself.

The way the weapon system works and the durability of each weapon works in a bastly fair way, as they break over and over but you never feel like it will leave you on a bloked position, and what it makes it even better is your management, as you you might want to leave your better weapons for later or tougher situations, just see it for yourself when affronting guardians.

Cooking in tha game not only is the mechanic to replentish your health but to give you certain boosts or extra temporal hearts, and you have to think through your recipies as it can be bad for link in a funny way too. And this is only the tip of the iceberg as you inmerse to find out other collectibles and crafting materials.

Talking about gameplay, it is a superv polished experience as weapons are handled in differnt ways, parring and dodging are simple but you need to polish your skill as the enemies behave acorrding to their equipment and your moves, unlike the rest of the other zelda games were they have a determined move pattern (yes even in skyward sword). So is up to you to interact with your environment and improve your reaction skills to master the game itself, and there ar a lot of options to do so.

Storywise, Breath of the Wild, is as charmy and goofy (at times) as you would expect from a Zelda game, but don´t get fooled, it really goes into deep emotional scenes and reelations as you explore the world and meet unique characters that well are part of the main story. The voice acting in this games works wonders, specially in japanese and latin spanish, as I found a little less emotive dialogues in english, specially Zelda´s emotions (and we all have seen it on the trailers, so it is not spoilers). So I can say it has been an improve to include it, FINALLY, and talking it to a great level of quality overall, and even if it´s still not fulle voice acted it does a magnificent job all the way, cuz it still gets the nostalgia feeling of all zelda fans. Thou, I would have preffered a Hylian made up language for it, but that is just me hehe.

It is hard to say if it takes Ocarina of time´s spot as Breath of the Wild has been crafted in modern standards and with a more integrate overall experience, but is easy (foer me) to say is the best Zelda game ever made, if not, THE best Nintendo game ever made!!!

P.S. I Really don´t get how people give this game 0s and 1s? I can just imagine that they have not even played it yet or just based their opinions on trailers or even just nintendo hate, Metacritic should do something about that, for all games in general.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lorenzo92_,13-03-2017,"I'm a great fan of Zelda series;
I have completed most of Zelda's games from ""A link to the past"" to ""The wind waker"".
I have bought Zelda and the Nintendo Switch to revive my old passion for this beautiful series, but it has really disappointed my expectations. After entering more and more on the real gameplay of Breath of the Wild, i feeling annoying and unsatisfied.
After i have discovered first villages and played ""dungeons"", i feel playing another game.
Zelda of the past years contains long and difficult dungeons, in those Zelda they are only mini games and four - five dungeon.
Let's talk of the World Map: what the meaning of having a really extensive world map but with only few contents?
This is not the game that i expect;
This is a Zelda too different from other games.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
andisart,07-03-2017,"I've clocked in around 30 hours since release 5 days ago, but barely scratched the whole content of the game. There is so much still left to explore and discover, yet the time I spend so far was filled with wonder and excitement. The world of BotW is the star of this game! This is the best designed open-world I have ever played. Beautiful, alive, rewarding. What a pleasure to take in on breath of this wild after the other.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Exanthius,07-03-2017,"I tried very hard not to get too hyped, despite all the footage of the game, all the early reports of how good the game is and the great trailers Nintendo released. As a Zelda fan since 1998 with Ocarina of Time being my favorite game of all time, I was of course looking forward to the release of Breath of the Wild. A huge part of the excitement is caused by nostalgia, of course.
After playing the game for around 20 hours I can already announce this game as my new favorite game of all time. It blew me away from the first steps. Every 2 minutes I encounter a new feature or detail that just makes we stare at the screen with an open mouth. It's not only the major features of the game, like the vast world to explore, the intelligent enemies or the well placed music. It's the little details that Nintendo obviously put a lot of effort in. All so often I think ""Hmm.. let's see if this works"" ... and it DOES. Every single time. I was in need of a fire to prepare some food, so I read the description of the flint and I just put some wood on the ground, placed flint next to it and hit the flint with a metal weapon. The wood caught fire and I had a nice cozy place to roast some apples. 10 seconds later the fire went out and I wondered why. Of course, because it was raining. I set up the next camp fire under a tree.

The graphics of this game are stunning. Yes, it's a special art style but they really did a great job at creating moody atmospheres, detailed models and oh my god, the lighting is incredible. Besides Witcher 3, this game has the most beautiful sun sets that I just enjoy watching at for minutes.

The game has flaws. But none of them justify a 0/10 rating. I don't understand why Metacritic allows that. THe performance on the Switch in TV mode varies, but is satisfying over all. The controls are difficult to learn and it happened that I died because I hadn't mastered the control layout, yet.

On a side note: The sound design is on point. Everything makes sounds as you would expect them to do. Your wooden bow on your back makes wooden sounds as it continuously hits your wooden shield. The wind blowing through the grass while animals make their own noises made me forget how little music is actually played throughout the game.

I have only made a few steps into the main story so far, but what I have seen up to this review made by jaw drop to the floor. Of course, a lot of nostalgia is causing this (and the tears in my eyes) but the story they're are building up from the beginning is compelling and makes me find out more about it.

What I probably love most about the game is the feeling of being rewarded. You get rewarded for being curious, for exploring new places, for experimenting with techniques and gameplay mechanics and for taking that additional step through a forest, over a river or down a cliff. Not in Skyrim, not in The Witcher 3 have I felt this sense of adventure.

Despite not being flawless this game deserves nothing but a 10/10 rating, for all the positives easily outweigh the negatives.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Richtea87,09-03-2017,One of the best games in recent years. Im not even a big Zelda game and this game has had me hooked since day one. Don't believe the 0 scores on here. This game is truly magical. 10/10,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Captivate,05-03-2017,"This game is absolutely amazing! I'm playing on the Wii U and it looks gorgeous! The colour palate, the sound design, the character design are some of the best I've seen in quite a long time. The story itself is beautifully told with a more mature theme behind it and Link's portrayal is done beautifully. I can't say anymore without spoiling the game. I can't say anything about frame drops since I'm playing on the Wii U but I haven't noticed anything jarring or game-breaking. This is quite possibly the best Zelda game ever made, and maybe even one of the best games Nintendo has ever made.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

licorice,15-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a very fun game, and it has voice acting which is generally pretty good but can be dodgy at times. However it loses major points with its weapon durability system that proves to be nothing more than an enormous headache. Aiming is a bit of a pain in the ass as well and arrows never seem to go as far as you'd expect.

It's a good game and it looks like a lot of fun, but the intense frustration of the poorly designed weapon durability system is no end of frustration.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
blakehaas,24-03-2017,"This game looks beautiful, has some good game mechanics but has a pretty boring story (didnt grow up playing zelda). Ontop of the boring story, it quickly gets lonely in this large world. The primary fun things are the ruins but after a while the puzzles get tiring and you dont have much left to do but to fight random enemies that are scattered around the land.
This feels like a lord of the rings game without the ring.. I just dont feel any compelling reason to beat the game. I feel like this was beyond hyped and really is only for zelda fans.

Overall i was disappointed.
Snipperclips is the hidden launch title gem btw.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Antioch,13-03-2017,"I, like many others bought the Switch solely for this game. I bought a console, for one game... and note that I'm predominantly a pc gamer. Not many games has that power over me but I have had a thing for Zelda games since childhood. So needless to say I had high expectations.
This game delivers on alot those expectations but also comes with alot of dissapointment and some frustratingly annoying obstacles and imo mindblowingly stupid decisions that does not add but detracts from the gameplay and ultimately stops it from reaching a higher score.
It's a beautiful world filled with alot of stuff to do but there are also alot of empty areas. You are completely free to explore it at your leasure. You can even run to Ganons castle and take him on right off the bat, of course your chances of success are very slim to none in doing so wich in a way forces you to play certain areas in order to get your character strong enough.
There are shrines with puzzles around the world that can give you uppgrades and four big bosses to take on in what you could call dungeons, even though they are more like puzzle rooms with a boss at the end.
The enemies arn't at all that waried and mostly comes in the form of the same enemies with a different color, but they behave in quirky funny ways reacting to what you do. They even goof around going about their business even when not engaging you.
Normally most games borrow from Nintendo games but there are aspects in this game that you can clearly see they have borrowed from other games like the ""Far cry towers"" and some DS influences.
Combat is generally fun although the difficulty in this game is just making enemies hit harder and be damage spoonges. It also borrows from survival games and the witcher where you can cook and make elixirs. The menu/item management for this task is a bit fiddly. In fact inventory and menu management overall are a bit fiddly and non intuitive.
Motioncontrol is implemented but in a smart, good and creative way, it never felt like a chore.
The bad comes in the form of frames tanking heavily alot. Maybe I'm more sensitive to this than others beeing a pc gamer, but when it happens during combat it has such a negative impact on gameplay, especially when the max is already a low 30fps.
""Link"" also has a ridiculous low level of stamina to start with. Stamina shows up as an ugly bloblike green circle above your character that drains when you sprint, swim, climb etc. And I kid you not a fat legless man can outrun ""Link"" and you need to spend atleast 4 upgrades on stamina to even get to the level that I think is the very least Link should have started with. And these upgrades comes at the cost of much needed health.
Also when you climb Link slips ALOT if it rains (and it rains ALOT), most of your stamina is drained while getting nowhere... wich means if you're half way up the mountain and it rains you are utterly f*cked. A pointless frustrating gamemechanic that adds nothing, it doesn't really add challenge, it only adds frustration based on bad luck.
Unlike some previous games you don't really get a specific special magical bow. You can find alot of bows but they are utterly useless because arrows have a dropchance akin to legendary drops in a Diablo game and are too expensive to buy.
But one of the worst things they added to the game is weapondurability. I never really cared for weapondurability but they were okay and manageable in some games like the DS series. There resource managment and preparation was a huge part of the gameplay. Also the weapons lasted pretty long and could be repaired to their former glory.
Weapons in BOTW are made cheaper than the cheapest chinese fake copies and rarely last you more than a few enemies. And each time a weapon breaks you have to pause mid combat and choose another weapon, if you don't have any you have to scroungefor defeated foes to pick up their sh*tty sticks to fight with.
The few weapons that can be repaired are needed to be taken to certain npcs and they cost so much to repair they are never worth the resources to repair to just last a couple of enemies more.
The only weapon I came across that breaks but can return to it's former glory is the master sword, but even that comes with alot of caveats.
This constant breaking of weapons means you never look forward to looting new weapons and you are put off using the better ones because you want to ""save them"" for a special enemies, meaning you will be fighting mostly with crapweapons the entire game.
This was to me a mindblowingly unnecessary sh*t gameplaymechanic that detracts so much from the game. Constant interuption of flow and combat with frustration as a result. Atleast if the durability and repaircosts were somewhat reasonable it'd be a bit better but as it is now... no it is a HUGE negative.
But despite that, overall this is still a good game but it is not the masterpiece alot of people claim. I do recomend it to anyone having a wii u or switch",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ookami1111,03-03-2017,"Un gran juego no es el que tiene los mejores graficos o el juego que carece de fallos, un gran juego es un juego que brilla mas que todos sus errores; es un juego que despues de haberlo terminado se queda contigo. Dicho esto, Leyend of zelda breath of the wild es un gran juego. Por que no se trata de historia, graficos, jugabilidad o banda sonora, se trata de una experiencia que junta todo lo anterior y lo hace magistralmente, puede que a primera vista si se analizan de manera individual un par de aspectos parezcan deficientes, pero es la suma de todo lo que conforma a Breath of the wild lo que hace la diferencía, este es uno de esos casos en el que analizar los ingredientes que componen una receta es una accion injusta, si tenemos en cuenta que el resultado final es grandioso. No quiero entrar en spoilers, así que solo dire que si eres del tipo de persona que gusta de los mundos abiertos o eres seguidor de la serie Zelda, disfrutaras mucho de este juego, y si no eres parte de ninguno de los dos grupos anteriores no te cierres a este maravilloso juego, mira un par de gameplays, deja de lado los prejuicios y adentrate a este hermoso juego.

Al final, para mi con sus mas y sus menos este es un juego de 10, por que sí, tiene algunos fallos, pero como dije antes un gran juego no se trata de fallos, si no de los aciertos que eclipsan esos errores y en este juego lleno de luces te sera muy facil ignorar todos esos pequeños huecos de oscruidad.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Story: there is a story! It's just not your old straightforward Zelda type of story. There is a very clear line of main quests. It's just not linear. You can opt to do them out of any order.

The game is really fun, and sometimes quite hard (but never frustrating). Because you are allowed to explore just anywhere, you may wander into some pretty bad-ass enemies. But just imagine your satisfaction when you single handled kill an entire army with explosion, stealth and combat, which also gave you awesome shields/weapons/arrows.

redsyrup,04-03-2017,"IMO Nintendo's games are on their own scale because we all expect excellence from a developer with infinite resources (EAD) and on that note this game is a solid 8.5. You can round up or down from that based on nit picking. For me my concerns proved true and there's hardly a story. On top of that the music is so sparse it feels like you could be playing on mute.

Nintendo, like Konami with MGSV, focused on satisfying but eventually repetitious gameplay. Both companies sacrificed tight narratives in doing so. This could be a modern curse for Open World games. In Nintendo's case they also withheld on voice acting which just makes them look cheap in today's market. For instance Mario (Mario 64) talks more but has less lines of dialog. It's 2017 and Link still doesn't have a voice? Charles Martinet is perfect for Mario and so many other Nintendo staples why hold Zelda back in this area?

If you've played Fallout 3, 4 and MGSV you'll know what to expect. It's none of those games in terms of story but in gameplay it's satisfying just not ground breaking. Certainly not a 10.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The wilderness can be punishing but you are introduced to the rules early and the game plays by those same rules throughout. This game is truly a masterpiece and deserving of all the praise that it's receiving.

All the characters feel fleshed out and they're fun to interact with.

The eye candy this game gives you makes you forgive the framerate drops as you find yourself truly on an adventure that i haven't had on a nintendo console since Metroid Prime. The organic way the game teaches you how to survive in this world coupled with the out fo the box thinking you adopt to tackle not only combat but the puzzles is refreshing and was needed for the launch of the Switch. I'm 25+ hours in and have just now done my first big boss and find myself not just wanting but needing to explore more. every mountain is an opportunity and every stone needs to be turned. If you were on the fence with this game there are far worst things on the market to drop your money on than this game. Its an experience that is worth having as you'll remember this game along side FF7, LoZ:OoT and pokemon as being eon you wanna revisit often and with pure love.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Antares1187,06-03-2017,The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an incredible journey and an exhilarating adventure in a rich world. A real must-have. I played a little more than five hours and I can not tear myself away! A truly unique game!,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Fabiking,06-03-2017,El juego esta muy bien logrado. Es increible la cantidad de cosas que puedes hacer y la gran posibilidad de exploracion que tiene. Los graficos son muz bellos y los paisajes apabullantes. Aqui hay horas y horas de diversion. Totalmente recomendable.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Wuffelz,06-03-2017,"I was a little bit concerned because of the crafting system they implemented in the game. I really dont like crafting in most games. So I was quite surprised that it was actually fun to craft all the different food. Otherwise the game is really great. The world looks beautiful, the atmosphere is great. I love that there is not much music in this game.
I play it on the switch and after the day 1 patch including the zelda patch i didn´t had any framedrops at all. Untill now I only played it in portable mode.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Unmoth,06-03-2017,"Best game in the world! I played all the Zelda's console gaming (not the gameboy versions) and this is one of the best Zelda ever made! Probably it's not as good as Majora's Mask, but it's in the second place for me :D",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MiinaMat,06-03-2017,"One of the best games I have ever played. I am quite big Zelda fan, and for a long time Ocarina Of Time has been in my top 3 favourite games of all time (that includes also Dark Souls and Fallout 2)... But now I must say this is the best Zelda game I have ever played. Superior atmosphere, hard enough, and it is really fun to explore this huge world. Usually I don't like all the (new) hyped games (rather hate those) and I think there has been lack of good games for a long time. This game I like very much!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TechniTIger,06-03-2017,"I'm going to break this into 3 parts, and start with the negatives I've encountered, then talk about the characters and story (no spoilers past what's shown in trailers), and the world and exploration.

Let's start with the bad. There are frame stutters and occasionally I've seen the game lock up for a moment. On the Switch version, this happens most when docked on the TV. They never really ruin the experience, and are not overly frequent, but you can't ignore it. Weapons break easily, so you're constantly shuffling an inventory with a somewhat clunky interface. The Inventory UI is shared with system menu and quest logs, so your shoulder buttons change the menu entirely. In order to search through the several categories of picked up items you have to scroll through the pages one at a time. At first this is alright, but later in the game the clutter stacks up and it becomes more difficult to deal with. For the most part, the UI is OK, but I'd say it's JUST OK in an otherwise stellar game. Now, this one kinda stings a bit. Some of the voice acting seems to fall flat, or is missing the emotional intensity it feels like it deserves (at least in the English version). It may be deliberate, as the characters I notice this with most are not Human/Hylian, and most of them don't quite talk the way we do, so despite my personal gripe with this I'm giving it a pass, but I'll still call it out. I think they could have done better.

Moving onto the characters, I've always been a Zelda fan, but it's been years since I've been pulled into a game as much as this one. The story is written in a way that makes you, the player, fit into it. Link remembers nothing but the world remembers him and it leads to really interesting and powerful encounters with the characters around the world. Everything is written in a way that makes the world feel alive. The game had me seeking items, accomplishing tasks and running on adventures through dense forests searching for what happened or why characters know my name. I'd love to go deeper into this, but I'm trying to keep this spoiler free. I absolutely love the characters and the story is emotionally engaging, I'll leave it with that.

I've put about 35 hours into the game so far and I've explored about a third of it. Every shrine feels new, every village is a surprise to come across, and even the fields in between are full of the unexpected. The world has a certain buss to it. Monsters hunt on their own, wind can move the environment, and I've even seen a monster killed by lightning for raising a metal sword in a thunderstorm. The people of villages wander about, hunting, foraging, and trading as you'd expect small settlements to. All of this makes the game world feel more alive than most open world games. Every corner is filled with content, and even returning to fields you spend an hour or two in earlier often reveals something you may not have noticed.

Overall, I'm giving this game a perfect 10. Even the UI drawbacks and frame-rate do not diminish the score in my opinion, because every other part of the game exceeds expectations and certainly makes the title one worth looking into.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AKraftyBasterd,06-03-2017,"This game is an awesome return to open world exploration. You have a plethora of things you can do, and a huge world in which to do them, and generally you can choose any order in which to do them, even if that means you WILL die a lot. The game auto-saves often, so test your might, stretch your wings (or paraglider), and explore a world with loving detail. The negative reviews, from what I have been able to see, are whiny little elitists upset by technical things like FPS, but don't bother to actually, ya know, play the game. Some of them even say it is good, but then give it a zero, which implies some misunderstanding of how the score works?",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Zalbags,06-03-2017,"I came here to just see what the score was, because after 4 days of playing this game, I thought I would give my 2 cents worth and was surprised at the polarization. Most people seem to love this game, but about 20% seem to not like it at all. This is very puzzling, so I thought I would give my take. To begin, I have been in love with the Zelda series since the first installment on regular NES as a young child. I grew up on Nintendo, and have played almost all of the Zelda games completely. For those who have been around and played all the games, and loved the original Legend of Zelda for NES, you will most likely love this game as well. To me, this game is the closest they have come to actually realizing the epic adventure of the first installment. There are so many throwbacks to that original game, and it is truly epic. Had I been in charge of game design, this is the direction I wanted to see. Open world exploration without a set linear path, which is how the first game played, granted, as open world as you can get for a 2D game, but none the less, this is the modern day version of that game. To be honest, I haven't enjoyed the last 2 games as much, skyward sword and twilight princess, as the games felt to me pretty linear. Go to dungeon, get new tool, go to next dungeon. Solve some puzzles, and don't get me wrong, I love the zelda puzzles. But that original title has a lot of exploration too. To me that has been what was missing. Not to mention, the past couple games were in my opinion, too easy. This game gives a healthy challenge. At times, almost feeling like Demon Souls. Creatures will just 1 shot you if you get hit by some stuff. Overall, this game is just breathtaking, and to me, is the best zelda game period.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
CunningGoblin,06-03-2017,"Game is amazing. Can't stop playing it. Have not had this kind of bewilderment with a game since I was a kid.

GrilledYaki,07-03-2017,"Minus some issues with frame rates, I was pleasantly surprised with this game. While admittedly a bit tired of the open world style of game, BOTW handles it much better than say far cry or just cause, as you are able to reach every area right out of the gate after finishing up the first area. The AI is reactive and smart, as enemies that may have been benign threats in earlier titles are now more challenging, as they will often kick bombs that you dropped back at you or attack from range if you're far away. The Physics are impressive as updrafts from fire and trees will sometimes fall over while fighting larger enemies or if you chop them down. All in all, I think Nintendo hit a home run with this title and BOTW will likely be praised long after release.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
GhostRyderz,07-03-2017,"Although I have not finished the title to completion I have spent many hours playing this fantastic game. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an outstanding title that I would recommend to anyone. I for one have spent a large time exploring this massive world and have not got bored or tired of traversing this diverse and captivating world.

The gameplay is crisp with the odd lag spike here and there that does not ruin the experience at all for me.
The combat is rewarding and the new weapons system satisfying. Even when a weapon breaks the animation is oddly satisfying to watch and eases the pain of your favorite sword being lost forever. Even cooking in this game is fun as there isn't a need to look up recipes online but instead just throw whatever ingredients feel right into the pot and start cooking.

Overall I have no issue with giving this game a 10 as it has offered a lot and still has more to give. I can't wait to keep playing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Why I gave it a ten when I think It's flawed, well I cannot describe how much I enjoy playing this game, just the feeling I have when playing this game, and all the experience I had with it so far are totally worth a 10.
So go play the game and just find out what I'm talking about. And 0s for it having a ""bad"" graphic and low framerate are hilarious just like the ""the world doesn't have enough to do"" ones, please just for story and mechanics I'd give it a 7, but then combined with me having so much fun just exploring makes it a 10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Fastidiado de tantas entregas de mundo abierto, en las que simplemente se limitan a ofrecer una experiencia generica, cómodas en su mediocridad, sin intentar ir más allás y ofrecer un experiencia que verdaderamente te ofrezca un punto y aparte en tu historial de videojuegos. Hay un gigantesco número de jugadores segados por gráficos medianos y una jugabilidad promedio con mecánicas del montón, pero en Zelda Breath Of The Wild por fin encontramos un respiro. Seguramente que será un título aborrecido por los casuals que tienen en la retina tatuados los gráficos y las historias grandilocuentes de tantos juegos genéricos, pero es motivo de alegría ver que aún hay gente que puede apreciar un título de calidad, la cual va más allá del aspecto visual e historias pretenciosas. Nunca juzgues un libro por su portada, y es el mismo caso cuando hablamos de una entrega de Nintendo que lleva su sello de calidad. Naturalmente alguien que no lee, o que tiene pañal, ni siquiera podrá vislumbrar el significado de lo que he escrito, así que no se dejen engañar por pseudo analistas y gameplays por parte de gente cuyo rango de calidad es tan amplio como el patio de su casa.

There is so much to discover in this game that I feel like rushing the main story doesn't such a disservice. I really love the climbing aspect of the game. It adds a whole new dimension to the world. Instead of looking at roads, you look at cliff and and towers. I never expected Nintendo to pull of a game like this. Also, the frame rate issues are overblown.

A solid, fluid combat system. Probably the best combat system ever implemented in a sand box open world.. I love how vibrant and colorful the world is.

DMJohn0X,23-03-2017,"The best Zelda game? Maybe. Personally, LttP will always be the quintessential Zelda experience. But we are talking about BotW.

This game is a great entry into the 3D open world genre and the physics system is quite fun, allowing you do float objects with baloons. On the surface, it doesnt seem very special, but later when you find yourself bombing grass for flames just to swap to your parachute to use the wind currents generated by the flames to drop in on an unsuspecting encampment and you gain an appreciation for the nuances this system lends to your playstyle.

The story is good for a Zelda game, but don't expect an epic tale of any sort. The worst here is how lame Gannon feels in this game. He doesnt come across as particularly powerful and dont expect to learn much about his character or motives. He's simply the generic bad guy this time around and hardly memorable.

Now the bad.

The UI is awful, you cant reassign buttons, they arent intuitive, and early game weapons break often times every other screen making the first 6 hours of the game feel like an exercise in menu navigation management. The interface doesnt lend well to how many weapons drops given your limited inventory space. Due to the frequency by which your weapons break, the band aid fix was to throw a limitless supply of loot at you so often you'll find yourself spending far too much time browsing your inventory and dropping weapons to pick up new ones, until you get to the point where you wont pick stuff up anymore.

Another issue is the lack of music, much of the game is supported by ambient noise and what music is here, isnt anything compared to older games in the series.

Lastly, On NX Switch, the game suffers frequent frame drops and stuttering in docked 900p mode. This is mostly resolved in portable mode. And DigitalFoundry on youtube has done a great video on documenting this topic.

Ultimately, I can only give this game a 7.5 out of 10. This game was a GREAT Zelda game, but just missed the mark on several issues and ultimately takes a hit due to performance. I think many of these reviewers are doing a disservice rating botw 10/10 which should be reserved for Genre defining works of art rather than just a good game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

jeffbizloc,31-05-2017,"The more I thought about it the more I did not think this was anywhere close to a perfect game. It was still good overall with the bonus being a Zelda game.

Pros:
- Excellent puzzles in the shrines
- The 4 dungeons though small were also excellent
- The world was overall pretty good as far as traveling and climbing
- The runes were a lot of fun and sort of go along with the enjoyment of puzzles

Cons:
- Weapon system just not a fan of the unrealistic durability
- I love Zelda music. This game did not have that epic exploring feel. I understand in the open world for realness but give it as an option or make the 4 dungeons have that awesome music.
- No achievements. Ok that is on the system but I feel to get all the shrines and do all the upgrading is entirely unnecessary to beat the game. Why have all these sidequests and large universe if they don't really matter for the end goal.
- Too easy. You don't need to do much to easily beat the game. A couple health potions is all you need.
- Combat. Basic overall. I did like some of the techniques used on the bosses that were creative but overall it was basic and unchallenging.
- Enemies were very sparse. The ones you do find in the overworld I am not sure the point of fighting them.
- Crafting I am not a big fan of in general. I am sure Zelda does it fine here but again you don't really need much of it.
- Stamina meter. Wait it takes stamina to run and climb but not in combat?",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Cdom,01-10-2017,"The game itself may be fun at first but the more you play it the more dull it feels the combat isn't very interesting and the types of weapons that aren't just different because of their higher damage, is low and the enemies aren't much of a threat if you think that the ""Master"" mode will be more difficult you are wrong, what is actually does is make gameplay MORE dull and boring as the enemies have more health and regenerate said health making any strategy that doesn't involve damaging the enemy every 2.5 seconds invalid. The map design although is pretty enjoyable and by far the best part of the game is just exploring and doing puzzles but even then the puzzles can be pretty dull sometimes. There is also very little true adventure in the game it never feels as though you really are at risk, making you just get bored and listen to a podcast or something while walking through the open plains of hyrule.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dangem91,10-07-2017,"The game is very good, but not the masterpiece everybody is overrating.

The game is amazing when it comes to the sense of adventure.
Exploration element is good.
It is very immersive as you feel like you have to take notice of everything around you, cook food, take shelter, hunt, change armor depending on area.
The art style really suits it.
Main quest is good.
Shrine puzzles are awesome.
Sound and music are good.
Game word is diverse in terms of areas but not in terms of enemy diversity.
After the boasting that Nintendo did about how Zelda is 1.5 times bigger than skyrim map, there are only 8 types of enemies with some enemies having different forms ice, fire, red, blue, etc.

Cons/needs improvement:
The game falls short when it comes to actual progression of your character; By this i mean your character will not be any different than your friend who's also playing the game.
This is a weak area in BotW when compared to the likes of Elder scrolls or Witcher where you have to upgrade skills and stats.

In Zelda the only choice you get to make when it comes to character progression/customization is whether you want to upgrade your health or stamina.
Even when it comes to armors, most of the time you will be using a specific armor set not because its strong or looks cool but because you have to (in volcano area you need to equip the flamebreaker armor set for fire resistance, In desert area you need to equip the Gerudo armor for heat resistance, same for when it's raining you need shockproof armor or when its color you need cold resistance).

Weapons break after 30 seconds of using them means the game is basically treating an the weapon system as scraps/tools to use and throw away after a few slashes, instead of encouraging exploration to get a weapon that you want and grow attached to it.

Fighting monsters in the wild is pretty useless since you don't gain anything and lose more weapons.

Side quests are also a bit boring and bland. While some might argue it is a good thing that the game does not tell you where on the map you must go to complete a side quest to encourage exploration and immersion, and i agree to the extent that the side quest is interesting.
In Zelda's case most side quests are so basic (go fetch ""add here"") that doing them does not feel worth the time since you rarely get anything noteworthy as a reward.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

You have a lot of armors to choose from like climbing and swimming armors that can really boost your climbing/swimming speed and make those things enjoyable. Many weapons to choose with different attack speed plus you have special powers like freezing time of some things or even monsters. A lot of shrines to find and figure out. 3 things i would add are fishing rod, unbreakable weapons and more dubbing",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Bad points: No HD rumble and, before the update, the frame rate had some issues playing on the tv. Now it only occurs when the system is about to save the game.

Senpapi,03-03-2017,"I feel sad for the troll reviewers who don't even dish out substance, only shallow reasons. Graphics=/= Greatness. Breath of the Wild has proven this. At the center of gaming is the sense of ""fun"", those are what games should be, not just a pretty looking, moving mural. Breath of the Wild brings what other open world games haven't exactly done, giving us a truly ""open"" world. You are at the wheel of this ride. You drive it to its eventual route, not the other way around as what games have been lately, and this is coming from someone who mainly plays on PC. Neglecting what it holds just cause it's a Nintendo game or its Zelda or it looks cartoony and childish is mind boggling. Undertale should've taught you this lesson already as it was arguably one of the most well acclaimed games during 2015. Breath of the Wild is a breath of fresh air from games that have been suffering from an overly similar style of play. Games as of late are either GTA clones or Batman Arkham clones. They become either shooters or beat-em ups. Breath of the Wild takes what is already there and refines it. I cannot possibly stress enough that of how many games I've come across, Breath of the Wild brings the ""open"" to open world. Open to exploration, open to possibilities, and only open to your imagination.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

iceburn91,06-03-2017,"This game is like watching a Ghibli movie. Every place is pretty detail and tells a story if you pay attention. The world feels alive and have a lot of hidden secrets. Exploration is really rewarding you can climb, jump, swim, skate the mountains and fly.

Music is not heavily present but that is great because the world and exploration is the focus point of this game, the music is only something used to better express emotions in certain moments that brings refreshing rhytms to the visuals. Also think about when you go to a new place to a mountain or a forest you really have quiet moments where you listen to your surroundings, birds, wind, leafs and so on and I think this game captures that feeling really well. Try to go to a new city for exemple and you will notice that your additive system will get more aware because you are experiencing something new.
Artistically this game is really appealing with a lot of colours and a imaginary look that let your imagination fly.

In terms of gameplay I find it really interesting because I hate when a game give's you weapons and armor that breaks but in this game I find it interesting because I teach you to use your resources well like in real life you have to take care of your things and also the message that nothings lives for ever, don't get attach to objects because that is not what makes your journey. So I find this interesting if we think about what to we carry after a journy what stay with us, what really matters?

Story wise I think is a good classic type of story where everyone can relate with.

Tot i que el joc tens un objectiu clar i pot sobrepassar l'amplitud del mapa i pot donar la sensació de soletat, realment no es així pq han sabut crear un mapa, que tot i que no te molts npc's, si que té la suficient quantiat de objectius i coses per fer, que fa que t'atrapi... pq de cop i volta et pots trobar amb un campament de goblins, com de cop et pots trobar un santuari, com un enemic formidable, com una foguera per poder cuinar , etc.

Absolutely love this game!

But I can't deny that it doesn't really do anything monumentally different, as most of the game mechanics and ""ideas"" are just watered down versions that you've seen done in other games. That's not to say this game doesn't do it just as well, if not better. But I can't praise a game for simply taking elements from other games and jamming them into a Zelda game and calling it innovation. Love the game, and having a blast playing it, but don't go in expecting a ""true"" Zelda game, 'cuz it ain't. It's Skyrim with rupees and no outstanding musical scores to even mention. Ouch.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Sicarius089,27-03-2017,"What ever has generally made a great Zelda game in the past from it's atmospheric dungeons, in-depth story and memorable characters to bizarre temples that often have religious, psychological, philosophical and theological elements to them often backed up by music and architecture that compliment and enhance the experience all seem to have been taken out. The only thing close to this is Hyrule Castle. Which has tunnels that link to different parts of the Castle, around most corners are enemies hiding in nooks and crannies, whilst a ghostly composed Zelda's lullaby plays in the background. This would've been more atmospheric had the game given more emotional support to characters from Link's past that had died rather than just experiencing less than a minute of memories for each character.

I felt no attachment to the four champions that had died, often I felt glad to be rid of them for how they treated Link. I felt little impact on when the footage of the guardians were waging havoc on Hyrule as I had no interaction with those characters and or towns. It had no personal element to it, I didn't have much empathy towards Link after playing for the first 30 hours as there was no events that brought out anything to flush out his character or to make the player feel attached as this was a new Link. There were probably only two memorable moments in this game that made me feel anything, that was reading Zelda's diary as well as the cutscene where Zelda tries to feed the frog to Link.

Voice acting is by far the most terrible I have heard and I wish I could turn it off. Having 900 koroks is overkill and is often pointless repetitive tasks, not puzzles that after a while you don't even get excited about exploring anymore after you have completed the shrines, found all the memories and side quests as you know it'll just be another useless weapon that'll break, or another korok. Had the Koroks actually had a heavy emphasis on the story such as planting seeds in heavily affected areas so the forest could be restored to it's former glory would be much more intriguing and investing into.

No under water exploration?! what the hell?! this was said by the creators to be the ultimate Zelda experience. Side quests were lousy and I would often complete them unintentionally even before speaking to the person. Only after speaking to a person would it flash up on screen only to come up with a completed marker. The pay offs aren't that great too, rupees I can easily farm using ore deposits, Weapons? they're just gonna break, armour, yeah I got that piece 10 hours a go. Where are the people that have been cursed where you have to find things like the skulltalas to lift the curse. This would've at least been an incentive to explore rather than just have an isolated cliff with four koroks.

Shrines in this were massively disappointing, as they were way too easy and I barely spent any more than 8 minutes max in the high difficulty ones. Where previous games had temples that you'd get lost in for hours. Had there been actual Temples in this world some the size of the great plateau in terms of space with dozens of individual rooms to explore and fight your way through would've helped make this a far better game. The shrine add nothing to the story only a means to gain health and stamina. Having certain shrines reward you with stamina and the rest playing a heavy role in terms of story would be a far better way to implement a better story. Not to mention having the heart pieces in previous games encouraged exploration as you're needing more health. In BOTW exploration isn't even rewarded.

The four bosses in the Divine beasts were a let down, I was looking for some interesting not to mention individual and unique designs. Whilst the four forms of Ganon did look awesome. It just felt like I was fighting a cheapened puppet four times.

Side quests have little to no choice involved what so ever. The most linear side quests I have seen in a long time.

What this game does right though, is open world is proper open world. You see a mountain, you climb it.
See a river with no way across, ok I'll cut down a tree and use it as a raft.
Horse riding is the best I have ever seen in a game, with little to no effort involved when on roads/paths, the handling feels natural and very easy. The cooking system is actually pretty fun with the different animations and noises for a successful or none successful experiment in cooking. The art style is amazing and breath taking, quite often I'd run out of stamina using the paraglider and fall to my death as I was just taken back by the scenery.

So the game was good, but no way near the ultimate experience it was said to try and achieve.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Captiosus,26-07-2017,"I grew up playing Legend of Zelda. The first game on NES was one of the first games I saved my allowance and mowed neighbors yards to buy. With exception to Skyward Sword, I have enjoyed all of the mainline console entries (and many of the handheld entries) of the Zelda franchise. So when I finally got my Switch, and thanks to the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I was stoked to pop in Breath of the Wild.

30 hours of gametime later and I'm woefully bored. Let me be succinct: This isn't a Zelda game. Sure, it has the location and character names, the stylization, the same old ""beat Ganon""/Triforce story, but don't let that fool you. The core of the game is a mediocre open world collectathon.

If I were to mention a game where you have to collect hundreds of items to upgrade your inventory, health, and stamina, have multiple in-game currencies for items and other upgrades, and have to climb towers to unlock area map information while using a scope to identify landmark points of interest, you'd think I was talking about an Ubisoft open world game. Except that's precisely what Breath of the Wild does.

BotW takes this penchant for collecting further by almost becoming a survival game. Gone are the days of buying/finding jars, buying potions in shops (or from witches!), finding hearts in containers, or keeping fairies in jars. Now it's all about hunting animals for meat, gathering insects, enemy parts, ores, herbs, spices, and other ingredients and then cooking. Endlessly cooking - and there are HUNDREDS of different materials. The materials themselves give paltry benefits (if any at all) but cooking them turns them into feasts and exilirs. Unless you go look up a strategy guide for what ingredients you need, the cooking process is all experimentation. In the 30 hours I've played thus far, I wouldn't at all be shocked if I've spent a third of that in front of a fire.

It doesn't end with just cooking. Weapons and shields have paper thin durability so you're constantly breaking weapons even in the most basic of fights. This requires constant carrying of extra gear in order to swap when your weapon, bow, or shield inevitably breaks. You must also carry different sets of elemental resistance gear because if you wander into an area that's too cold or too hot and don't have enough resistance from gear or potions, you can DIE from exposure as it reduces your health as a damage over time effect. And just to remind you that they're going for realism, basic actions can become more difficult with various weather conditions (e.g. climbing while raining means you'll slide down a lot and have to start over).

""But the shrines"", I can hear people saying. Sorry, these Shrines are a very poor imitation of what previous Zelda game dungeons had been. They're often only one or two rooms with little to no challenge. Take ten of them and mash them together and you'd be close to having a proper Zelda dungeon. Quantity (and there are many, again, see ""collectathon"") doesn't equal quality.

I don't know what this game is. It looks and sounds like Zelda but it plays like a sub-par mashup of open world games from Ubisoft, Rockstar, and Bethesda. Stylistically it looks great and despite the occasional frame drop, I enjoy looking at the game and visiting its locales. But the combat, the constant need to be a hunter/gatherer and cook, the open world fluff and the snorefest Shrines.. it's all just so dreadfully boring.

It's not a 9 or 10, nor is it a 0 or 1 game. It falls squarely in the middle. On some level, it pains me to rate this so low as it's clear they put a lot of effort into it; However, this is an example where going to a western RPG open world style fundamentally changed the core of what made the franchise and not in a good way.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The shrines feel too easy and short as well as never reaching that wow this is cool moment, the weapon durability is a nascence but i dont feel its a massive downside to the game. another problem for me is the lack of truely cool places to discover outside of quests like ive never come across a cave thats keeps getting deeper n deeper full of enemies n cool scenery leading to a cool reward.

•Annoying animation and text popup when upgrading armor.
•Annoying animation everytime you complete a shrine, and there are hundreds of them!
•Annoying breaking weapons, even Master Sword breaks and needs to reload.

•Inventory (WAY too many different items + too much time spend in inventory menu)
•Bad / Inconvenient inventory management (to drop item or weapon you have to press start first)
•Durability of damaged weapons/ shields, doesn't show how many more strikes until it breaks.
•Sprint and jump button layout very inconvenient
•WAY too many armor sets and pieces. And most of the armor makes Link look even more feminine.
•Link looks like a girl / shemale / very feminine
•Link is Spider-Man. Link can climb ALL walls like spiderman, even flat surfaces.
•Link can't climb walls in shrines = Inconsistent!
•Link can't DIVE UNDER WATER in this game! Not even with Zora armor.

•Combat feels clunky, jumping instead of rolling
•No more Z-Target Bow/Arrow shots
•Swordplay is big degradation compared to all other 3D Zelda games. No horizontal or vertical attack with sword anymore, only one type of attack.
•Little to no enemy variety. Same enemies over and over. After first couple of hours you have seen all enemy types.
•Bombs are infinite , overpowered and boring.
•Bombs are infinite , why bomb arrows not? =Inconsistent
•Map is way too big, therefore empty and boring most of times.
•Your horse wont hear your call 99,9% of the time, have fun walking around this huge map.
•You spend 90% of the time climbing some damn rock!
•Game physics: items and bodies tend to slide/roll very fast, as if the ground is out of ice
•Killing harmless animals (birds, squirrels, fox) and eat their flesh? WTF Nintendo?
•Stupid animation when killing an animal = animal turns into a steak!

•Fairies look like fat transvestites. -No joke. What happend to OoT good looking fairies?
•Korok Seeds are boring and very, very cheap map filler. Have fun finding 900 of them.
•NPCs have no character, are not memorable and look like anime cartoon.
•Shopping is boring. Shopkeeper in old zelda games had charisma and were memorable. Not in Breath of the Wild.
•Sheika Slate, an electronic iPad like device in a Zelda game WTF? It just doesn't fit!
•Chests and sidequest will only give you useless rupee or another breakable item. After a while you wont even bother openening chests anymore.

•Very bad voice acting. Not only the voices are bad, but also the usual zelda npc noises sound worse compared to other zelda games. One example: Beedle, the merchant from Wind Waker, sounds overly exited, as if he was on drugs, which makes him sound silly, and he doesn't say ""thank you!!"" anymore. The overall voice acting is just disappointing. Also, speaking voices don't fit in a Zelda game at all. They should stick with noises and text.

Final thoughts:
Breath of the Wild is like a very expensive bottle of whiskey or wine, which has been mixed with too much water. There are very good elements in this game, but it is watered down by the overly huge map size, which makes it feel empty and boring at times. The lack of connection to the actual story, the fact that the sidequests and the million chests that you can find in this game are completely unrewarding, the lack of background music combined with the fact that there are no valuable weapons or items since all of them break, makes this game feel more like an open world, survival, climbing simulator, than a real Zelda game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The combat is the biggest change here. They have an item system with durability rolled in so weapons and items are all temporary. There's no more 1 sword, 1 boomerang, etc. You get tons of swords and boomerangs. Makes it that much more special when you find the master sword.

The game is also hard. I used to rarely if ever die in a Zelda game. I died a few dozen times in the first couple of hours alone in this one. It's more like Dark Souls than the typical Zelda. They also realized that getting items like the bow and bombs and all that is really boring so they made them super easy to access right from the get go.

The game has been refocused on exploration with the new climbing system, which is really the only true innovation in the game. Almost every terrain is climbable. It adds a new dimension to the exploration that has always been a Zelda mainstay.

The puzzles are fun but not too challenging, pretty typical to the Zelda series. They did try for different ideas in this new game with spatial problem solving which I appreciate. The dungeons seem to have taken a few pages from the Shadow of the Colossus book.

One of the coolest, most thoughtful additions is that the last boss is accessible probably less than an hour from the start of the game. And you can go try your luck too! A really cool idea and it was very well implemented.

So with solid combat, great exploration, and good puzzles why is it a 7? The game just has too many noticeable flaws.

The voice acting is terrible. Everyone is gonna complain about it, it's truly God-awful. I wish I could just have silence and read text but there's no option to do that. What a shame...

Second, the graphics. They're bad. I get that Nintendo never cares about graphics and while the art is beautiful, these textures are worse than games from 7 years ago. I almost want to say I've seen better texture work in games like Gears of War 1 from 2006... That's just unacceptable. Being 2-3 years behind is whatever, being more than 7? Give me a break.

Third, music. I hate it. They tried to make the whole thing into a Miyazaki movie. The music just doesn't fit at all. You don't need symphonic music for everything with little cutesy piano pieces. It just doesn't fit the action or what's happening on the screen at all. I just never get that exhilarating feeling during action sequences because of how low-key and mellow the music is for fighting. I never felt like any of the zones had music that fit the mood or the atmosphere. It really detracts from the experience very very noticeably.

Lastly, the open world concept was just not done well. There's not enough here to warrant exploring an open world. There are only so many moblin camps you can clear out before it gets boring and old. While some of the environmental puzzles and enemies (like stone monsters you have to climb on) can be fun, the novelty wears off. Eventually it dawns on you that you're completing little mini-games. Where other games made their side quests deep and immersive (a la Witcher 3, Skyrim etc) this game's side quests are fairly bland and unimpressive.

The game is fun, if you're gonna buy a switch you probably already have it. If you're debating whether you need to buy a switch for it: pass.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
StuOhQ,05-03-2017,"How many of the users posting reviews for this game have even played it? 784 down-votes? Metacritic really needs to verify ownership. Sooo much salt!

Either way, I love my Playstation as much as the next guy, but this is an exceptional game and certainly among the best ever made. Nintendo could have very well just crunched Zelda plus open world equals quality game. Instead, they created one of the biggest, most immersive open worlds ever made and expanded on the Zelda formula itself in too many ways to count.

I was incredibly over-hyped for this game and (despite all odds) it has exceeded those lofty expectations. Thank you, Nintendo. You've brought another masterpiece to the world at large.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bennibop,08-03-2017,"Good game not great and not one of the best Zelda games. The game has 4 dungeons and 100 shrines (mini dungeons) all of which are very easy and pose no challenge unlike previous instalments. Finding new Vistas and the sense of exploration can be great but getting there in the first place can be repetitive and frustrating as you are unable to climb when it is raining (which is the main mechanic for getting anywhere.)

The games framerate is awful, probably the worst I have seen since Just Cause 3 and it can impact on the game and definitely does on the immersion. I have also seen issue with physic where the game seems to stutter (perhaps due to switch cartridges.) Considering this is a Nintendo game it is very surprising as they have always prided themselves on high quality software.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Liverpoolgamer,07-03-2017,"Well i have been playing this and horizon since their launches to get a good feel of both games. I am not a fanboy, i own every console currently on the market and a P.C. Nintendo has been with me since a very young age, and i will always continue to invest in them for myself and my kids. But in my opinion this just is not the perfect game that a lot are making out. I can see the positives but it just does not give me the enjoyment i have experienced with past Zelda games. The visuals are not stunning for a brand new console, the textures seem very outdated and this affects the overall effect. Because there is a lot of empty space, the views of the world just dosn't have that wow factor. There is also alot of pop ins which can be distracting. Don't get me wrong it still has some of the charm you come to expect but comparing to HDZ this dosn't have the same appeal.

DarthWader,03-03-2017,"There are two types of negative user reviews for this game; those who have not played it correctly, for example claiming there is nothing to do or that the world is empty shows either a lack of creativity or exploration. This is a video game in the same way that the Godfather and Gone with the Wind were movies, or that Moby Dick and Don Quixote are books. Hyrule as presented in this game is the most complex, dense open world I have seen, and it ""feels"" alive in a way that no game has ever accomplished, which is difficult to convey in a review. To best enjoy this game I would recommend turning off the HUD, and not approaching it as a video game. Gamers for a long time have diluted ourselves into thinking we have used our creativity to solve game problems, when we were just using set pieces in a way that the designers had setup to create the illusion of creativity on our part. Nothing Breath of the Wild has done diminishes Witcher 3, which appears to be what the trolls are upset about, at all, on the contrary this title elevates the medium. As Zelda said, open your eyes.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Bristingr,04-03-2017,"This game is hands down the greatest game not just in the series, but possibly this decade and is a contender for of all time. Those that are giving the game a 0 or 1 are just trolling or picked up a game expecting it to be something it wasn't. It was announced to be an open-world game, and that's exactly what it is. It perfects what an open world game is supposed to be, and it does it flawlessly.

An open world game isn't supposed to have something to do every 5 meters, it's supposed to encourage exploration, finding treasure and secrets that may not be easy to reach or see. I haven't even finished the game yet, as I'm still working my way through the map alone, let alone the main storyline, and just the music, the immersion, and the fighting style is enjoyable. This game does live up to the media and fan hype, and is definitely the best launch title since Super Mario 64.

While the dungeons (now called ""trials"") are definitely much shorter, it's still puzzling at times to complete a few, and yes, there's still a god-forsaken trial that deals with water. There's plenty of things to explore in the game, and plenty of side quests to keep the game fresh and enjoyable. Those that say they completed it in under a few hours, well... congrats on doing a speed run and running straight for Ganon, ignoring the storyline completely. It can definitely be played that way as like Nintendo said at E3, you can literally do that if you so desire, but it's not recommended and you won't get the full immersion of the game.

As a game designer, this game is the bar that all developers should aim for when designing such large-scale/open-world games. The mechanics and difficulty are perfect for those who have played a Zelda game before. Nothing seems over-powered, and there's plenty of small amusements (those that love to find a way to interpret meanings to being more innuendo than it should be).

They delayed this game for so long and pushed Switch's release up just to get this perfect, and Nintendo nailed it perfectly (the game, not the Switch). This game is worth that perfect score of 10 for its category.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

GhettoBoxMan,08-03-2017,"This game does not deserve a 10/10. People who give Zelda BOTW that score are being completely bias because they are a ""Fan Boy"" and by giving the game a 10/10 they are staying that nothing is wrong or should be changed in the game, which is ****

This is the first Zelda game I have ever played and the only reason I played it is because there were no other good launch titles for the Switch. Many people say this is the best Zelda game in the series but of course as this is my first Zelda game I can not confirm that. I am pleased with the game and have a sorta ""Addictive"" feeling to keep playing it, but I also have many issues with the game.

Yes, the game looks amazing and it is kinda fun to play but that doesn't mean its a perfect game.

What I mostly don't like about the game is the Lack of purchasing weapons. This is an open world game where weapons, shields, and bows have a breaking point. It is very hard to get through harder portions of the big map because you have to find weapons and you can't just go to a village store and purchase some like almost every other RPG game has, Instead you have to find chest hidden throughout the map with items in it. With weapon degeneration this makes it especially hard to fight bigger enemies since you have very limited item space for weapons and once your weapon is broken you lose it forever and can't go purchase a replacement.

The music in this game is ABSOLUTELY annoying and repetitive in the Villages or Stables, all you hear is ""DO DO DO DOOOOO"" on a repeat and it pisses me off to the point where i just have to turn my volume off.

On that point I would like to complain on the lack of settings the game has. There is no Audio control for the sounds and music in the game like every other modern game has, there is no button remapping, and overall the settings are just so basic that it makes me wonder who the **** made this game. I feel like a mental retard must of made the setting tab because it seems like they forgot most things that belong in a settings menu.

Now lets get to the gameplay, the fighting mechanics can surly 100% be improved upon. This is a up close and personal combat game that does't have proper DODGING OR ROLLING! Like WTF basic movements are not even in the game. There's really no combos ether (or at least the game hasn't told me how to do them).

Most of the time when doing missions the game doesn't even tell you in detail where to go or what to do, the game gives you a brief ""Clue"" on what to do and expects you to know exactly what to do. Most of the time I'm left looking up the game guide to know.

The shrines in the game are repetitive, its the same room just a different puzzle and they get harder depending on where you are on the map.

The map is big but it is also very empty, where is all the big villages? All you get to go to are small villages that have more people than they do houses.

Where is the in game voices? You get little voice acting in the game. You can go from a character talking in a cutscence to being quite back in the game. They shouldn't of put voices in some parts of the game but then leave the rest quite. Surly the Zelda creators have enough money to have everyone in the game speak, but I guess they were to lazy to do that.

There is also a lack in dialog you can say and the outcome you will have, you get no sense of choice in the game.

There is a lack of places to explore to, all you really explore in the game is the wilderness that's it. No caves, no abandon places, no random structures, nothing other than the shrines.

There is no recipe book ether for cooking, most of the time you have t go off memory on how to cook certain stuff. I don't get why they couldn't add a basic book or recipe tab in the inventory menu.

There are many more things in that this game has wrong/lack with it that I can't get into because of the 5k character limit but what I can say is that this is just an average game in its series. It may be the best since is is now open world but it does not deserve a 10/10.

This game is a very basic Open World RPG. In fact if you took away the Zelda name it would really just be an ""Okay"" game. You add Zelda to the title and everyone instantly gives it a 10/10 because they are fan boys who find nothing wrong with it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

There's SO much to explore, so much little detail, I can't help but applaud the Zelda team for managing to step above and beyond.

gq_foine,03-09-2017,"UPDATE: Over 136hrs+. This is in the top 3 best Zelda Game ever made! Anyone giving this less than a 9 is not being honest or fair because this is absolutely stunning!! Disregard all 0! They are lies! And truth is this game. The puzzles and open world is nice. While this is NOT a perfect game. I think it is should go down has one of the best Zelda games.

Positives: Great Open world- Con - 9.5 The world can be sparse and not enough variety of enemies
*Game play - 9.5 Amazing puzzles and dungeons - Cons - Need more Dungeons- They only had 4 mechanical beasts dungeons (not enough)- Swords break a lot and require you to pick up silly weapons - sticks.
*Music - 9.0 its great during the battle and open world but its not loud enough or variety.
*Graphics- 9.0 -its definitely good, but frame rate issues and could be better in some areas - Wii U+.
*Story - 7.0 - I think Link to the past is better game.

Overall, I think its a great game and one of the best Zelda's ever created, but I think its missing a few important things - amazing story, more variety of enemies, More dungeons, and frame rate issues, music needs to be more dramatic. I think a perfect 10 on this Zelda game it is not. Its definitely a solid 9.0+.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

tsmasher1000,03-03-2017,"First of all do not be alarmed by the difference in critic score and user score. That is merely salty fanboys who don't have a life and probably weren't even born when the classics were around. That being said, this is one good game.

Let's get the negatives out of the way first because there's very little of them: The graphics and textures look a little sloppy and the framerate dips (though not very often). That's all of the negatives.

Now for the positives: The innovation in this game is quite astounding. I've played the Witcher 3, the Dark Souls series, Skyrim, and Grand Theft Auto IV (but not V), and this game has definitely a new feeling to it. When I play the other open world games, it feels like I have great scenery, but I am always limited by something. It was a little disappointing at times to feel like I was limited. Perhaps I can get over to that mountain, but there's no reason to really do it, and often I actually can't climb that mountain. Perhaps it's too steep or there's an invisible wall. In the case of Zelda however, there is the feeling that not only can I reach that mountain, but I can interact with it too. I can approach things however I would like and not only does it work, but it rewards you for it. That gameplay mechanic in of itself gives an incredible feeling and sense of awe. I can climb (almost) any surface, but I must be prepared to do so. Just having the tools isn't enough; you have to have the brains as well. To be quite honest,

I did not enjoy Skyrim or the Witcher 3 as much as people hyped them up to be, and perhaps that is my own fault with my expectations. However, even with my expectations hardened, I felt Zelda made me respect that world and respected me. This game will allow you to do almost anything you want; the whole environment is interactable in some way or form (and yes I literally mean EVERYTHING. See that tree, you can cut it. The grass you can burn it, etc.), but if you are not prepared for it, you will be knocked down. I will not spoil the game too much, but all I can say is that the gameplay is truly incredible.

Now onto graphics. The graphics were the only part of the experience that was not out of this world. There were some bluriness, pop in, and frame rate issues (though the last one is rare). However, that being said this is a VERY good looking game. I often found myself marveling on how I felt like I was playing a Studio Ghibli film. Though the resolution may not be the best, the artstyle is incredible and truly beautiful (which matters more to me) and the slight hit in resolution and texture quality was not bothersome. The artstyle makes the world feel incredibly alive and is incredibly beautiful. Even in this category, Zelda Breath of the Wild seems to excel if you can forgive some minor downsides.

Next is sound. Though there are not much music, I must say the amount there is, it only added to my immersion in the game. I was initially disappointed when I heard that there would be less focus on music in this Zelda. Every Zelda comes with a classic soundtrack and hearing that there would be less of that in this one was somewhat disheartening. However, I take that back now that I've played the game. I actually prefer it this way. The game is so immersive that any overworld music, that was not the delicate sounds of simple piano that sometimes plays in the background, would have been immersion-breaking. You are so invested in what you are trying to do that simple overworld music may break you out of the experience. The sounds themselves are very impressive. You realize when there is something amiss in the atmosphere, or when you hear a sound you recognize it for what it is. It is very well-synced to the world.

For the last one, story. I am not going to spoil this game. It's not just a game, it's an experience and only my 5th 10/10 ever since I started gaming in 1996 (for reference the other four are Zelda OoT, Metroid Prime, Resident Evil 4, and Chrono Trigger). So, just hear this; I found the story to be good and mature and only helped to increase my immersion and enjoyment of the game.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is truly something special. It's a masterclass game, an instant classic, a game that we will be talking about many years down the line. The world that this game takes place in feels truly alive; it is a game that will continue living on as one of the greats and is truly a legend.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Ok so starting with the gameplay, it isnt repetitive as people say, they think it is because they dont try new things such as with the combat, people say it si repetitive but they make it repetitive for not trying diferent things, the music, people that dont like it give the game a 0, eiter you like it or not every single song fits the game perfectly, the storu people give the game a 0 because (spoilers) link wins and it is to predictable, the story is good and gives you the sense that you are ina an epic story and that you are part of it, that is why lik is such a bland character. As for graphics, they are bad, but i never have cared for graphics so this doesnt affect me and the game is still beautiful because of its art style. Seriously if people looked at the game objetively the scores wouldnt be lower than 9/10, for me this game is perfect in every sense i highly recommended it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Nintendo kept me waiting for very long, and I was indeed hyped for this game. i confess I was so hyped that I was afraid for a disappointment. It usually happens when we get so hyped about something that takes so long to be released...

However, this was not the case. The game is just perfect so far. Beautiful. the game innovated so much, brought so much new stuff compared to old zelda games without going away from the roots. The story is beautiful, the music is beautiful, and the graphics a beautiful. I love the gameplay. I always though 3D zeldas had a problem with AI, but this time it is really hard to fight versus group enemies because they are so smart now. Well done Nintendo.

So many open world games make exploration feel natural and forced, but not BotW.

I'm a little biased as a Zelda fan, but this may be the best game I have ever experienced. The ONE con I can mention is that there are still some framerate hiccups. But they aren't terribly frequent and the game doesn't turn into a slideshow, it's just a brief drop.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I have been playing it for hours and hours, and this game deserves a 10. The only thing that I didn't like was the short durability of some weapons, but they're so easy to get that it isn't even important. Wolf Link is really recommended. Its graphics are perfect, its story is perfect (specially to Zelda fans or people that know a little bit about this saga) and it is really, really funny and relaxing. Fights are fun and I think that dungeons, even they're not as memorable as in Ocarina of Time ir Wind Waker, they're great and very well designed. Although very people say it, it isn't overrated at all. Don't believe those people who gives it a 0 or a 4, because most of them are Sony fanboys that envy this game... And finally, I have to say that I'M NOT A NINTENDO FANBOY, I REALLY LOVE SONY AND PLAYSTATION, I HAVE EVERY SINGLE PLAYSTATION SINCE PSX, but some people like me hates Nintendo.

Gecko300,11-03-2017,"I'll some this up in one sentence.
This is a great game, it's not a great Zelda game.

Lets start with THE GOOD:
-The open world aspect IS fun, exploring the world and wanting to know what's just over that next ridge is thrilling. (However this does wear thin pretty fast .... see bad.)
-The combat is probably better than it has ever been; rather than enemies being mostly a nuisance that you just thwack away at...these enemies take some timing, potions and skill; especially in that early-mid game. It's not dark souls/witcher but it's V.Good for Zelda.
-The artistic design is nice and never gets stale to look at. It's a far cry from the drab and dreary OoT or Twilight princess.
-It's different...hell that might be a bad or a good thing but I'm putting it in the good. Zelda has been doing the same thing for 30 years and it's nice to see them try something else.

THE BAD:
-The story, I'm not asking for greatness in a Zelda game, however it was so cool in OoT when you pull out the sword and fly forward in time...In link to the past when you go to the dark world. Where is THAT here? It feels like I'm playing half the game most the time...with all the coolest and most fleshed out characters left 100 years in the past!
-The ""dungeons."" These are embarrassing to say the least, why even keep these hollow shells of their former renditions in the game? Just try something different. Instead we are left with what essentially comes down to 4 larger shrines that take all of 10-15 minutes to complete with 0 difficulty and 4 end bosses that fight/look almost identical.
-The sidequests, 90% of these SUCK SO MANY EGGS. This is basically about an effort/reward type deal. Minor spoilers but one person wants me to go searching high and low for rare ingredients or a super rare weapon and rewards me with JUST 100 Rupees!!! (Which I could get in 3 minutes from grabbing all the apples in a town and throwing them in a pot.) With heart/stamina containers given out for completing the shrines and the breakable weapons it almost makes the sidequests completely pointless.
-Which goes back to exploring...I used to search in Zelda games because you are looking for that hidden quest that leads to a heart piece or some rupee's for a bag upgrade. But with nothing to really upgrade other than armor it's kinda worthless other than just enjoying the beautiful world.

THE UGLY
-The music: for a series that is known for it's beautiful music...this game is severely lacking in it. A few musical cue's here and there and a bit of fight music. The rest of the time enjoy the dead silence and the sound of Links sword banging against his shield.
-The faaaaarming. Ok the most farming I've personally ever done in a Zelda game before this is about 30 mins farming in Majoras mask for the biggest wallet upgrade. But in BotW my God...to upgrade all the armor would take hundreds of hours of just running around following the bleeping and picking up fish/mushrooms/guts/butterfly's. I think I've already put in over 15 hours of solid farming for armor upgrades.

Again this review may come off as negative but it is a beautiful and fun game.
However take out the useless side quests, crappy farming and kinda not worthwhile exploring and you're left with maybe 12 hours of main quest line for a mediocre story.

It might be harsh...however if they continued to improve on this formula + did the classic 2D Zelda for a handheld console. I think I'd be in heaven.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
childofacid,04-03-2017,"This is one of the greatest Zelda games of all time. A true masterpiece! This is what open world games should strive to be like.

Its graphics are good, it's mechanics and game design are pretty decent. It's a nice open world game, but it isn't perfect. I would prefer OoT or maybe even the original, although I did like WindWaker. I think the game is fun, but I think it needs a tad bit of more tutorial. The fighting mechanics are nice, but not the best again. The story might need a slight bit more work, but I will wait for the expansions. The soundtrack is also another plus. In my opinion, the main points holding it back for me is the lack of a tutorial and the fighting mechanics. The world is massive, and if you are a die-hard fan, go get it. If you're a casual Zelda player, go get it. If you've never played, it's a nice entry to the series. If you don't like open world or adventure, I would not recommend. I think the story is nice, but once again, slightly lacking.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Bullish,26-06-2017,"Been playing Zelda games since the early 90s and this is easily the most impressive world they have ever created. It's just a shame they put nothing in it. I 100% completed this game just so I could say this confidently: This game is trite. Look up the word, and you'll know I'm right.

It's almost as if the creators are laughing at me for collecting all 900 seeds. When you get 900 Korok seeds, you're rewarded with a gold trophy that looks like a pile of **** and in the description it even says it stinks.

+ Huge World
+ Exploring, especially the climbing and flying around
+ Shield surfing

- There's nothing in the enormous world but repetitive shrines and a billion Korok Seeds. While on the topic of Korok Seeds. There are 900 seeds, discovered by 12 different puzzles. 900/12=75. That means you are doing the the average Korok Seed puzzle 75 times each. That's awful.
- Cooking was tedious and made Link unkillable
- Weapons/Shields/Bows all broke too easily
- The Master Sword has a battery life
- No balance in the 4 main dungeons (the 2nd was a rubix cube the others were a joke)
- Lack of enemies, especially in the 4 dungeons
- All the bosses look the same and took no thought. If you had enough food you could just beat them to death. Not that every boss needs to be puzzle, but I think it would have been better if they were. It is a Zelda after all.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Zemeckis,17-04-2017,"I played all previous Zelda games and couldn't continue with this one after 12 hours. The game is just not fun for me. Weapons that break all the time? Cheap deaths like in swimming or lightning attacks? One-hit kill by stronger enemies? Starting the game with tons of powers instead of gathering one by one as the story progresses? Framerate issues? Seriously, how come people say this is the best Zelda, and even the best game ever made? Better than A Link to the Past, Ocarina and Majora's? Extremely overrated, in my opinion. If it were any other game without the Zelda name on it, it would not get more than a 7 or 8. Some things in this game are great, like physics, visuals... But that's it. I'm concerned about the future of this franchise.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dark_D3s7r0y3r,22-08-2017,"I'm using the scale of 1-10 where 5 is average, 7 is very good, and 10 is a game that's perfect, no flaws or frustrations to be had during my entire experience. As in, there is absolutely nothing I can say that I think would improve the game. So rating it a 7, I think this is a very good game. If you have a Switch, definitely pick it up, you'll probably have a good time regardless of the things you may not like about it.

Let's start with the good. The world is ENORMOUS and you really feel it. Seeing a mountain off in the distance that you have to run to before you can fast travel to has that grand feeling of wonder and exploration. The world feels alive and active, as well, with different weather patterns, events, and collectible flora and fauna to use in cooking and upgrades. Cold areas require special gear not to freeze to death, and hot areas require special gear not to die of the heat. Some areas rain frequently, some areas have thunderstorms that make it a bad idea to carry metal weapons around, some have sandstorms and blizzards and rolling blankets of fog that obscure your vision. It all makes each visit to an area that much more unique, since there will likely be a different weather forecast each day.

The art style is stunningly beautiful. It's as if they took cartoon drawings and directly translated them 1:1 into a game. It really speaks for itself.

The story is very compelling. Throughout the game, I genuinely wanted to know more about Link's past and was interested in learning more about all the people he met along the way. And with an entirely non-linear path (it's totally possible to beat the final boss from the get-go without breaking anything), the journey feels like it's my own unique pathway through the game.

I absolutely love the horse capture/training system in this game. Finding the perfect horse, registering and naming them, and forging a bond with them as you ride all feels surprisingly natural, and makes each horse you train feel special and personal. Though I'd prefer if patterned horses weren't arbitrarily worse than solid colored horses...

And now let's look at a few negatives, starting with the obvious durability system. The issue isn't having weapons to fight with, the issue is what the durability system brings to the table. Which is just making you pause mid fight to switch to the same weapon you were just using just for it to break again in the same fight because Lynels have a billion health and weapons don't. Previous Zeldas did just fine without a bizarrely hamfisted durability system, and Breath of the Wild would have lost nothing if they gave you less frequent, incremental upgrades rather than a mountain of weapons to break. In fact, it would have made combat, hitting stasised objects, and archery minigames actually fun to experiment with instead of just dreading having to break that one weapon you found because the game says so.

Draw distance, framerate, and resolution are all terrible due to the Switch's extremely limited processing power. I'll frequently find myself missing distant items or enemies simply because the game can't draw them from more than a moderate distance away, and in areas filled with visual effects the framerate plummets from its already sub-standard 30fps. It's sad to see such a grand idea for a game limited so severely due to only being released for underpowered hardware. While the Switch is a great mobile system, it certainly doesn't make a very good modern home console. But I digress.

Rain is also a big pain to deal with. If you need to climb somewhere and it's raining, you may as well just plop tour controller down and go make something to eat while you wait it out. And if the rain lasts for more than one weather segment, you could be sitting around doing nothing for minutes. I don't understand why they decided to add in this bit of realism instead of weapons that realistically didn't shatter into dust after a handful of encounters (or one big encounter).

There are a few puzzles that force motion controls. These same puzzles also give what you're controlling a significant delay. It basically feels like shouting instructions at someone across the room to do something that requires a deal of precision with how unresponsive it is. Not at all fun to deal with.

And finally, there are also puzzles that require precise player movement. The issue with this is that on top of Link not immediately moving as you instruct him, the Switch's joycons don't give nearly the level of precision required for these puzzles to not feel like a chore. I guess I just need to shell out another $70 on a pro controller...

Again, this is a great game, but I seriously fail to see how it gets perfect 10's.

metapaws,06-03-2017,"Haven't finished the game yet - nowhere close - but I can see already that BotW is one for the ages. The experience of navigating this world, the detailed eye for its rendering of nature, the way the tonal color palette and mood changes constantly with the dynamic weather system, amounts to what feels like a first-person Legend of Zelda anime movie directed by Miyazaki. It is done so well, and crafted so beautifully, that you will find yourself choosing to bypass the fast travel system and ride your horse on your forays - or even go on foot - simply to wander the endless expanse of Hyrule in search of its secrets. In that way it recalls Shadow of the Colossus, although it far exceeds that games level of detail, beauty, and variety of environments. BotW places its aesthetic experience in the foreground, of equal importance with any of the quests you'll undertake on your adventure. Somehow Nintendo not only makes the approach work, it makes it sing.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

MorseMoose,05-03-2017,"It has been nearly 10 years since I've purchased a video game system but something about the Switch got be to get back into gaming. A part of that was the openness of Zelda. I had played a few Zelda games but never on my own system with my own copy so ""nostalgia"" doesn't play a factor here. But after three days of nearly non-stop playing, I can be assured that it was well worth the price. After many hours spent playing Skyrim, I was worried that this would feel too similar or to childish compared to that but my worries were for nothing. It's huge...it's epic...there's non-stop stories. The only thing that it lacks is in the graphical front. While the scenery has a look of what should be beauty (and at times, does look nice), it lacks a bit - especially when a lot is happening.

brent2223,09-03-2017,Metacritic needs to address the amount of trolls spamming negative reviews. I'd say like 95% of the 1200 negative reviews are from people who have never played the game.. Ignore the user score. Read the critics reviews. They're not blinded by fanboy alliance. This game is absolutely phenomenal. The sense of exploration and wonder is unlike any other video game. Great combat. In dept side quests. An immersive world that you can interact with. Very intelligent puzzle design that's physics based. A masterpiece is a the perfect way to put it.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Grimmke,23-04-2017,"My feelings on this game are terribly mixed.
Good: a truly excellent open world, beautifully designed, artistically gorgeous, endlessly explorable. It brings fresh life to the now-standard idea of an open world. The new Link is full of personality for a guy who never really talks. NPCs are charming, quirky, and often funny, and exhausting their dialogue options is always worthwhile. The physics engine was incredible! One thing they really did right was in all the little details. There are plenty of joyous surprises for those who want to experiment and explore. So let me repeat--this is an excellent game, and it's worth you time. A superlative game, compared to others on the market. It is not, however, without flaws, even quite serious flaws.

Bad: The enemy variety is uninspired. A handful of enemies that are repeated endlessly, with different skins and colors. Unlike previous Zelda games, you won't find any redeads, wallmasters, poes, or any unexpectedly terrifying monsters like Dead Hand from OOT. No scary enemies or creepy dungeons where you might hear the telltale shriek of a redead paralyzing you.
Hand in hand with that is the boss variety. Unlike previous Zelda games, there aren't new and exciting, visually impressive bosses that challenge you to use the skills and tools at your disposal. You fight the same boss 4 times, and then again as the end-game boss. Over and over, with slightly different elemental powers. The final boss looks like it's trying to pass for a monster in Yharnam--but if I wanted to fight Yharnam monsters, I'd be playing Bloodborne, not Zelda. It's nothing like Ganon. It doesn't have the crushing difficulty to match a Bloodborne enemy anyway.

Combat quickly becomes lackluster with the frustrating weapon durability mechanic. Rather than encouraging variety, it encourages you to use your worst weapons the whole time for fear of losing your good ones, or the ones with elemental powers that you need for special enemies. The master sword's ""energy limit"" is some serious garbage too. A breakable master sword? Really? In the end, the durability mechanics turned the MS from the Blade of Evil's Bane to the Blade of Chopping Down Trees Because I Don't Want to Waste My Other Blades.

The story is often charming and could have been great, if they had put more focus on developing a compelling story. But, like the music, it's so downplayed it's barely noticeable, so that when the occasional familiar Zelda element slides in, it feels weirdly out of place. The music is not very memorable, and nothing like the sweeping epics of its predecessors. Once in a while, a familiar tune will play, and in the final castle, it finally comes in full-force. But it feels like a fun musical Zelda reference in a non-Zelda game. Jarring.

Dungeon variety is woefully nonexistent. Arguably the most impactful element of the franchise's incredible legacy, sprawling, complex, rich, and sometimes nerve-wracking dungeons are part of what made the series so famous. They're iconic. But they're totally excised this time. You have shrines, 120 samey mini-dungeons with repetitive puzzles. And you have divine beasts, 4 samey, slightly larger mini-dungeons. There's no variety to them at all, nothing to make them even visually distinct and interesting. Even exploring the beautiful open world begins to lose its appeal when you realize that the only rewards you will find are shrines and korok seeds.

I could go on. But it boils down to this one sad, strange feeling. There's a difference between shaking up convention and straightforward iconoclasm. And this game falls too hard toward the latter. Utterly gutting the series icons gave us a breathlessly beautiful product, with nothing under the surface, least of all a Zelda game. Maybe it sounds trivial, but I find that Link's redesign is not only one of the worst offenses, but emblematic of the underlying problem. They took Link's iconic green outfit with his pointy hat away, reportedly because it doesn't ""look cool."" Sure, in isolation, there's nothing especially cool-looking about the green tunic. But it DOES look cool--because it looks like Link, from the Legend of Zelda, and Link is cool. He makes it look heroic. There are lots of cool-looking video game characters out there, but there's only one who looks like Link. The attitude among the devs that said Link isn't cool-looking enough is the same attitude that said Ganon needed to look like a Soulsborne villain. It's the same attitude that took away deep dungeons, exciting bosses, creative enemy designs, and cool weapon variety. It never felt like I was playing Zelda. As an open-world RPG with a barely passable Zelda skin, it was neat. But it soured so fast I was feeling heartbroken by halfway through the game. It's sad to see the devs disregarding the legacy of such an important series. In the end, what makes Zelda so special was gone, and that, for me, outweighed the joys.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
a6210,05-08-2017,"While I would consider BOTW an above average game, calling it a 10/10 masterpiece is just wrong. This trend happens with most new Zelda games, skyward sword which many people now consider to be ""bad"" is also blanketed with perfect scores and user reviews calling it a masterpiece. In truth, Breath of the Wild suffers from glaring design flaws... First is the world, the map is HUGE, but there's not much to do and there aren't enough enemy variations. Once you figure out how to dispatch a certain enemy (Lynel for example) its a matter of rinse and repeat on the next palette swap variant. Exploration is the main focus of the large map but I found it to be unrewarding. The biggest things to find or Korok seeds which are used to increase your inventory size...there are 900 of them... and they are often found simply hiding under rocks. Have fun traversing a large map literally turning over ever stone you see. Speaking of inventory size, get used to seeing ""Your inventory is full"" every time you open a chest. Others have mentioned their disdain for the weapon durability system, and I tend to agree with them. Having the ability to repair weapons would be nice... or having some sort of durability indication besides ""oh btw, your weapon is about to break 5 minutes ago""

Not to knock the specs of the Switch, but I'm torn on whether or not BOTW is a good looking game. At certain times the landscape looks awesome, it's colorful and vibrant with an impressive draw distance...Other times the textures look muddy and gross, reminiscent of a ps3/x360 game to be perfectly honest. Another thing that erked me was the overall difficulty of this game. It's just not challenging. There are cooking mechanics that can break your game, plus being able to pause mid combat to heal yourself/restore your stamina really takes the edge out of combat/climbing.

The story was told almost entirely through memories which I couldn't find immersive or interesting. Overall the story is the average: save the princess, destroy Ganon. They really did not take ANY risks on the story.

The physics engine, whatever it is, is cool. Your movements and attacks have a good 'weight' to them and watching enemies ragdoll can be hilariously entertaining.

I believe that fandom and the launch of the switch propelled this game into getting high mark reviews it didn't fully earn. It's a fun game for sure, but It's just not a masterpiece in my opinion. I think in time we will look back at this Zelda game and consider it to be ""just okay"" much like the legacy of Skyward sword.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

zuldo,11-03-2017,"Good, but not 98/100 good. I was a little disappointed in creature variation/design, difficulty level (its always like medium difficulty, but after you unlock some ""special abilities"" you just become super overpowered), the shrines were a bit repetitive (i wish they'd made the puzzles a part of the world instead of the same instance over and over), and I really felt that I missed the old way they did dungeons. The beasts are okay, but I didn't find the puzzles that interesting, and the beast bosses are just copy pasta? Would've liked to see some more creativity.

Other than that, Im sure you've heard all the praise this game has gotten. Id give it a 90/100, so all in all still a great game, but its been a bit overhyped if you ask me.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Coolcaspar,08-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the wild has the biggest Zelda world ever. But where Zelda stands apart from its competition is that the world not only is gigantic but also extremely interactive and inviting to exploration. The world has so unbelievable many different places that you wanna visit that you can just go visit. See an interesting place in the far, just find a tall place and glide over to it, find a horse and ride to it, climb a tall mountain and shield surf down at it, meanwhile you encounter different and interesting characters as well as varied and difficult enemies, which is also a plus.

This game is not just a walk in the park, it's actually quite difficult as you learn that many enemies can kill you in one or two hits especially if you don't have any armor equipped. It becomes a sort of chess match where you have to constantly analyze your enemies. Does he have a shield that he can use to block me? yes! Then I need to dodge his attack first and get the upper hand and then attack, parry his attack with a well-timed shield blast, jump around and attack from behind, or hit him really hard with a big weapon. Meanwhile you also have to be focused on the other enemies that are nearby and so on and so forth. And different enemies have different kind of attacks and properties so new challenges in combat are constantly being introduced. `

Then there are the shines, that are first introduced in the starting area "" the great plateau"". Here they give you cool abilities that you activate with your new item the ""sheikah slate"".Then after that shrines are mainly for given you spirit orbs which you can trade 4 of to get another heart or more stamina. Which I at first did nor really like that much because you don't get anymore cool new abilities. But then as I moved more out in the world I was rewarded with awesome loot from these shrines. And shrines are absolutely everywhere up, down, on land in the sea and so on. You usually use a lot of stamina to get to these places which segway's nicely over to the stamina portion of the game.

The games new function is that you can jump and climb absolutely anything which is so amazing. there are nearly any obstacles in your way of exploration that you can't overcome partially do to the climbing. It does however require much stamina which is why large mountain climbing trips is hard for poor Link if you haven't upgraded the stamina, but again if you are smart enough you can still make it up the majority of the mountains if you just plane you ascent correctly, and scout out resting spots where you can stand and get your stamina back, which means that you are again for the majority only limited by your own skills. Certain areas do though require that you are well prepared with some being either too cold or hot for Link to travel as he is without certain equipment or (which is so damn cool) special elixirs that give him heat, cold or flame resistant.

But how do you get these special elixirs you might ask, well, you make it. In the Legend of Zelda Breath of the wild you are also able to cook, which you can do to make food or elixirs which both can give you special effects as for example the resistant I mentioned before, attack boost, stealth boost defense boost, and many more. Cooking is also so fun because you find different ingredients in the wild like, animal meat, insects monster part and plants and then the description give you a general idea of what are use to make elixirs and what can be cooked into food, but you are never given specific details on what different mixes does what, so cooking is an adventure all on its own too as you try to mix all your new different ingredients in new and different ways you discover so many new recipes and it's always a joy to discover a new one that works well, trust me.

With all this exploration and open world gameplay you would think something like story might get shoved a b it away which I would have had it fine with, but F*cking no, Nintendo just gives this gift that keeps on giving because the story in the legend of Zelda breath of the wild, is the best goddamn story there has ever been in any Zelda game, with the best goddamn stories there have ever been in any Zelda game, and probably also in most games in general.

TL;DR and Conclusion
The legend of Zelda is one the most highly acclaimed video games series there have ever existed, and every installment in the series is another amazing adventure that so absolutely few games can hold up to. The shame this time is that there now just is no games that can be held up to its standard as it without exaggerating ascends over every other game that id out there at the moment, which I know is a HUGE statement to make, but after only playing 32 hours and not even being close to finish the game yet is it one I can with outmost confidence and sincerity. It is a masterpiece in every possible way, and I urge everyone to grab a switch and get lost in its amazing world.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Bendashcash,08-03-2017,"I love every aspect of the game. It kind of breaks apart in small ways from the norms of the series and they do it in a Fallout 2 transition into Fallout 3 way. Just like the following the original Fallout games have, Zelda is no different. Some people aren't going to like it, just because they aren't. If you love Zelda, and you love games, you'll love Breath of The Wild. There will be those who oppose it, but they know the true feelings they have for it.

DittoGod,08-03-2017,This game is one of my favourite Zelda games (just after ocarina of time). The gameplay is wonderful and the art is just beautiful. It gives you a sense of freedom that you don't get from other Zelda games which is a fresh way to play the game.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Fireantus,15-03-2017,"TL;DR – Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is pretty much the best open world game I ever played, overcoming for me even a brilliant experience from the Witcher 3, the old but trusty vastness of Skyrim quests and the freedom of approach in MGS5: Phantom Pain. The sheer physicality and material tangibility of the world opens up countless possibilities to the player, not limiting us in any way and most importantly, treating a player with respect, never really holding our hands and trying to explain to us what’s what. You need to find your own way, your own solutions and spark that exploration desire within you.

Okay, now that the short brief of the review is out, time for some thicker explanations. I am not a Zelda franchise fan. The only other Zelda I played was Link to the Past more than 15 years. I am not therefore married to the game lore and characters and general style. At one hand, it means I am definitely not blinded by thick glasses of nostalgia, but at the other hand it means I cannot really talk about ‘series atmosphere’ or common grounds with the other games in this big franchise. As for the moment, I put about 50 hours in this game, conquered three divine beasts and got my Master Sword. Did some side quests, explored nearly every region to some degree and had a complete blast doing so! Here’s why.

The game tells me that I am stupid. Or in search for a better word, just too comfortable. Simply put as gamers nowadays we are pretty used to being pampered by games, led by hand, have our games tells us exactly where we should go, what we should do in rich detail, so we don’t get frustrated, lost and impatient. Look at Witcher 3… It is an extremely fun open RPG, but when you pick a quest you don’t really need to figure things out on your own in most cases. You follow the breadcrumbs objectives on the map, or a rather obvious trail of blood or scent and ultimately, you are being led step by step to the quest conclusion. In Zelda quests, you often are given the bare minimum or not even that! Just ‘There is a bridge somewhere near the broken stone, and maybe there is something to it’. Or ‘There a legendary bandit somewhere in this region. Have fun finding him!’. And so on and so on. You are given a hint, a nudge, a little snippet on info, and what you will do about it is your very own decision. Frankly, even in the game tutorial phase the game tries to tell you that. Old Man tells you to find the shrines, give you a hint to use your scope and that’s that! There are no flashy objective indicators of any kind, you need to find the shrines yourself and mark the on your map with your own hands. And frankly, I love it…

Because the game managed to tinge my exploration desire in a big way. Yes, there is plenty of nothing. There are vast empty spaces of grass or sand or snow, but they also have a purpose – they don’t just exist to create a grander scale in the map, but also fills me with quite an irksome urge to find something and manage to spark my interest whenever I see something even a little out of place! Now when on a horizon line I see a curious tree, a ruined building, a cavern or unusual stone formation I will most likely abandon my straight travel to explore such things… And more often than not I am rewarded with a fun little discovery! Perhaps it was just a Korok or a buried treasure with some little reward, but just finding it was rewarding enough for me! And sometimes I find something big and extraordinary and it feels me with a glorious triumph and fuel my desire to wander around and poke under every stone.

The best example of that is my gradual change of attitude towards walking around. At first I ignored my surrounding. I went straight to combat, I didn’t give a notion to the tall grass or trees or rocks. Later I started to sneak, to look for alternate routes... And even later I was quite happy to make tree-bridges, catapult myself with Stasis and big boulders or create flying rafts with my octo-balloons!

The wonder of exploring goes greatly in pair with internal game logic and physics of materials. Wood burns down. Metal conduit electricity. Water is wet. Rocks are hard. It sound silly, but it offers some ridiculous consistency! Need to activate an electric-triggered gate? Don’t look for a second battery, make a trail of metallic weapons from the first one to cheat the riddle… It is possible. Like so, so many other things. Cut down trees to roll heavy log down the hill to crush enemies, burn the grasses to get air updraft, lock time on nearly everything to mess with it… Possibilities are outstanding.

Too add to that… Game is pretty to look at. Characters are fun. Locations differ a lot. Weapon system, where tedious, is superbly fun to manage from a mechanical perspective. Music is fantastic. Stories you uncover are really engaging in most cases. Crafting is superbly entertaining!

This game for me is an open world game done right.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kresnik64,08-03-2017,One of the best Zelda games ever realeased!! The negative reviews are just copy paste from any source the sony **** find just to hate the game that got better score than almost every single game sony has. 10/10 Best game ever...,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

wiiroy,11-03-2017,"Notice how, of the 1,948 user reviews under an 8/10, only 35 of them were written after 2 days had passed since the game came out. Those are fraudulent reviews, those people didn't even play the game. I've been playing pretty much non-stop for 9 days now and can say that I'm ALMOST ready to give a balanced review of the game. It's that big, and that deep. Just about every user review made after 3 days passed since release has given it an 8, 9, or perfect 10.

What I can say is that the ~40hours I've put in so far have blown me away. This game has created a new league of open-world games. A new freedom of play unmatched anywhere. You have total freedom, you can do anything, go anywhere, you can fight the final boss straight away if you're game enough (I tried and got whooped). The combat is deep and challenging. The puzzles are clever, and they make you feel even more clever. The possibilities of play in the physics engine are seemingly endless, with only the players own creativity to limit them.

The story is incredibly touching, making me tear up on many occasions. It has a perfect mix of mystery and progress, without being overbearing on the player's freedom. The world is astonishingly beautiful, I say that without exaggeration. I feel like I spend half my time gawking at sunrises, sunsets, epic vistas, or even simply the reflection of the sun on rained-on grass as it gently sways in the breeze while cloud shadows snake across the landscape.

There is always something mysterious in the distance compelling you to explore. It's a world evidently designed by perfectionists. But to get there, you need to think about how to survive in the wilderness. If a lightning-storm comes - hide from conductive metal. If it's too wet to climb a cliff - find shelter, build a fire, and wait for clear skies. Or else go hunting, foraging and cook meals or brew potions to prepare. Go catch a faster horse, name it and build your bond with it so it will better obey you. The gameplay feels infinitely deep, and all of it is fun.

This is an open-world game, an open-sky game, a survival game, an exploration game, an adventure game, a role-playing game, a puzzle game, a fighting game, an artistic game, It excites you, challenges you, rewards you, makes you laugh, makes you cry, and makes you think.

ThatFlint,08-03-2017,"Right now I feel like this is my favourite Zelda game to date and that's saying a whole lot. I never imagined a game to overtake Majora's Mask's number one spot. While that game's dark atmosphere and characters will always hold a special place in my heart, this game's amount of freedom to explore and its huge world, while still being accessible and not causing choice fatigue completely blew me away. The visuals look amazing (while the performance is somwhat unstable sometimes, though it did not hamper the experience), and the gameplay is really addicting, all of it, combat, puzzles and exploration. I simply can't get enough of it. I'm wondering what the next step for the Zelda franchise will be. ^^",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

guek,25-03-2017,An incredible experience. I cannot recommend this game enough. Nintendo has managed to create an experience that feels both familiar and incredibly fresh.

paskan,08-03-2017,"This is the first Zelda in almost 20 years that's legitimately made me question my love for Ocarina of Time. The sense of scale, atmosphere, and adventure in Breath of the Wild... it's simply unparalleled in gaming today. I'd grown so cynical and tired of third-person action adventure games, which makes it all the more surprising that a game like BoTW could so unwittingly show up and consume my everyday life. This game is a MASTERFUL example of gameplay engagement and world-building, crafting an environment that's equally fun as it is immersive. It has so many incredibly creative and inspired moments, and so deftly delivers on the promise of an adventure of epic proportions, that in many ways it draws out all of the flaws and limitations that Ocarina of Time had when it first revolutionized the gaming world and the franchise way back in the 90's (though I still love OoT all the same). Breath of the Wild is a fantastic game, worthy of reverence and of every gamers bookshelf. HIGHLY recommended!

Also, be wary of the negative user reviews this game is generating. For whatever reason, it seems there are a lot of vindictive anti-Nintendo trolls trying to besmirch the quality of this game. Please pay them no mind, as they've certainly not played the game at all (let alone own it) to realize just how high amazing a game it is.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Grubhead,08-03-2017,"Excellent game! No, it may not be perfect for everyone, but what game is? It saddens me to see that there are now many 0-3 scores by users who, instead of giving their honest score value, seem to be rating it very low on purpose just to throw off the high score reviews.

To quote a TIME Magazie article: ""...Exploring its expansive collage of verdant, gelid and sun-scorched zones is akin to tromping onto the set of a painterly Studio Ghibli film. It's like nothing else Nintendo has made, an experience so simultaneously prodigious and accomplished that it feels like a mind-blowing mic drop to the sort of ""open world"" games (Grand Theft Auto V, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, The Witcher 3) the industry seems bent on proliferating...."" - http://time.com/4683122/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/

I have played games on many systems since my Vectrex back in the early 80's...plenty of genres and more time than I should have. I definitely give this a 10/10 rating. I really have no complaints other than wanting to play it every chance I get. :) I have played most of the Zelda games and they have kept many recognizable elements from the series.

Just when I think this game has shown me all it can, I am surprised again. This has happened numerous times and I am not yet half way through exploring the world.

For those who are rating it a 0 or 1 just because of one or two things, please stop skewing the stats just because you want to spite other people. I am giving an honest 10/10 because this game truly has blown my expectations away, from the epic battles to the subtle environmental background sounds...this is truly an immersive experience allowing me to create my customized journey through Nintendo's epic story.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Focaccia,15-03-2017,"Although it may not be the best Zelda game ever made, that doesn't stop Breath of the Wild from being a masterpiece. Definitely one of the best launch titles ever, along with Mario 64. One of the main reasons Breath of the Wild is such a good game is its uniqueness: never before in a Zelda game has there been so much exploration. I can't imagine how much time it must take to finish the game at 100%. Breath of the Wild also borrows many things from Skyward Sword (which is definitely a good thing, because Skyward Sword did everything right!): the stamina bar, the shields that break, upgradable items, the temple of time with the statue of the goddess... I won't say anymore to avoid spoilers. Breath of the Wild is definitely the hardest Zelda game, you are going to die A LOT!

Bojangels,08-03-2017,"Truly a Landmark in video game history. Nintendo has shown their ability to not only adapt to contemporary trends in gaming, but to revolutionise and perfect any genre. The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has is far reaching and attempts to accomplish a lot of what you'd would expect from an open world game and much more. Breath of the Wild succeeds in everything it attempts to do due to the fact that while the game is full of many unique mechanics and elements, nothing is convoluted or overbearing. Everything is thought out, refined and available to the player without being forced upon them. Nintendo's mantra of creativity, fun, and accessibility means that the game is easy to pick up and begin, a joy to just even 'waste time' in and is magical and ever surprising to explore.

Retaining all the original charm that its predecessors were loved for, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild explores a new way to play that feels so natural for the series; one that gives more power to the player and puts adventure on every horizon.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Pikastroff,08-03-2017,"When it was revealed that the new Zelda was going to be an open world years back from now, I was one of those who was concerned about how it would be done, especially considering this ""change in conventions"" that Aonuma had talked about. When I saw the Great Plateau footage back at E3 2016, while I loved the new features, I was concerned that the entirety of Hyrule was going to be empty, with nothing to do, with no towns or NPCs, no side quests, nothing. Just a glorified No Man's Sky.

How could I be even more wrong than that?

This new version of Hyrule is FULL of mysteries. Whenever I think that I saw it all, I discover something new, interesting. Sometimes, it is more subtle, such as simply a new weapon, or sometimes, it is an entire town, other times, it is a character, other times it is a surprisingly interesting side quest, other times it is simply a beatiful location, and sometimes it is just an enemy interesting enough to take on!

Unlike the other more modern Zelda games such as Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild DOES NOT hold your hand. Not at all. This means that many mechanics are discovered by YOURSELF, and I think that it is a major thing with this game: things are discovered BY YOURSELF. For instance, many quests do not have a marker (or the marker just points to whoever gave you the quest, or something like that), and all they give you, for example, is a riddle which you have to solve YOURSELF if you want to actually finish that quest. The game is pretty cryptic at times, which does remind of the original The Legend of Zelda at times, which is a good thing in my opinion!

Many of the recent Zelda games were REALLY easy. By really easy, I mean ""so easy you probably only got stuck once or twice in the entire game and NEVER saw the Game Over screen"". Oh boy, that's not the case here. Like I said, the game is NOT going to hold your hand, and can be cryptic at times. Additionally, you will VERY OFTEN see the Game Over screen, since Link can die in many, MANY ways now, which includes challenging enemies killing you, falling off a cliff, getting hit by lighting during a storm (yes, that's possible), drowning, getting hit head-on by a goat which then throws you off on a large slope on which Link miserably slides on hard rocks and then stupidly dies, you name it, there is death everywhere. But yet, it is never frustrating, because even if you do die, the game will never force you to just retry and retry and retry whatever you were doing, you can just leave if you want, if you are frustrated. Plus, most of the time it feels FAIR, and even if you may not consider it is the case for some deaths, the respawn is quick, and there is no punishment for dying, so you very quickly come back to the action.

I've seen many people say that ""there is no story"" in Breath of the Wild. Two ideas: either they did not play the game and are just hating the game because you know, hating on the popular game is their favourite activity, or simply they just haven't reached the first village yet (and honestly, if you did not, you haven't played enough to actually judge the game much). The way the story is handled is a bit special in Breath of the Wild, since the main story is actually completely optional, and non linear. However, IN MY OPINION, the story still remained very interesting. I believe that is because in this Zelda, Nintendo made sure that the world of Hyrule was FULL of lore, much more than what we have seen in any previous Zelda game. And thus, the main story becomes much more meaningful thanks to that lore. Honestly, Breath of the Wild is deeper than ANY other Zelda game in terms of lore outside of the main story, seriously. It added so much to the Zelda mythos that I'm curious how it will be developed in the next games! Hyrule is so full of details in its environment and lore that for the first time, Hyrule actually feels like a world which has a history, which has its own mythology, its own legends.

In the end, I have very few problems with the games. The first one is the occasional frame rate drops. Luckily, Nintendo has done a patch on launch day which has improved them quite a lot, and now, even when they DO happen, which is rare, it is not that bad. I still hope though that they will do ANOTHER patch to remove them entirely. Secondly, while I really like the style of music used for this game, which is more subtle than other Zelda games, I do admit that in the end, apart from the main theme of the trailer, there aren't many musics which really stand out and stay in your head for days, which are heavily memorable, which many other themes in other games have done, such as the Lost Woods in Ocarina of Time, or the Great Sea in Wind Waker. However, the music is still good, so it is not THAT bad, since again, I see why Nintendo went in that direction regarding the music, since it does fit well with the game thematically.

So... Yeah. This is my favourite Zelda, now!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
JagsJaxFan,05-03-2017,"Maybe the best game I have ever played. This huge open world is also a playground of ideas. You can do anything you want and in any order. I've mostly spent my time climbing mountains just to paraglide off of them. Amazing story, great combat, and very tricky and fun puzzles. This non linear adventure begs that you explore every inch of hyrule. Not to mention the high but very rewarding difficulty. Almost everything about this game is amazing, top to bottom. The only limit to this adventure is your imagination. If you have a wii u, play it. If you have a switch, play it. If you don't have either, go to a friends house that has this game and go there very often. It is absolutely worth your time. 10/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The game has few problems, but I choose to look beyond these tiny things for everything else is just to good.

For those who wanna know the tiny things about the game that are a ""problem""
The framerate drops from time to time, nothing that I personally experienced a lot of, but it is present.
The dialog can sometimes seem very bland and boring at times even unprofessional.
and then there is the soundtrack, it doesn't bring a problem for me for I still love the soundtrack plenty, but U can certainly say that it lacks a lot in comparison to say ""Wind waker, Skyward Sword"" Which personally has my favourite soundtracks.

These are the things that can make the game tedious at times, HOWEVER everything else about the game is fantastic.
The journey, the openness, The story is by far my favourite among the Zelda series.
The characters a lovable. From Mipha to Revali to sometimes even the Npc's

GaRv3,08-03-2017,"It's very sad that obviously almost all people writing negative reviews never even played the game.
This is going to be an honest review after playing the game for many hours. This should be a must for reviewers but some people simply do not understand this. This is not the place for trolls and haters. And by the way: How can a game like this be honestly rated 0/10? Think about it yourself and you will see that this does not make any sense at all.

Pros:
There are so many positive aspects to say about this game, that it is simply impossible to list them all. So I will just write down what comes in my mind to give you an idea of what the game is like.
First of all the most obvious and perfectly integrated 'new' feature: total freedom. This is what describes the game best. You can go almost everywhere whenever you want. There are so many ways to travel the world.
This all happens perfectly seamlessly and there are almost no loading screens when you travel the world. There are only few situations you have to wait for some seconds and loading times are (at least on the Switch) rediculously short. So the whole game feels like a long, seamless experience.
That's how the game feels to play in gerneral, but what makes this special is that you can find interesting items, quests and characters all over the huge world. There is so much to find that I doubt there will be more than a few players who are going to find everything hidden in this world.
There are so many secrets and little easter eggs you can find in the game (Ever took a photo/screenshot of a dog next to you?).
Characters, animals and enemies behave convincingly.
The story fits perfectly for a Zelda game and offers some unexpected twists and new information about the franchise.
In most cases there are several ways to achieve something. If you think you found a solution, just try it - it will probably work!
The voice acting in most cut scenes is pretty nice.
You can play this awesome huge game on the go (only on Switch, of course).
Controls are intuitive and work perfect in most situations.
There would be so much more to say but I have to get to the cons now.

Cons:
As in every game there are some small cons too. No game can ever be 100% perfect. But these aspects are no dealbreaker at all.
Some performance issues in docked mode (Switch). Perfectly smooth in mobile mode but suffers from some frame rate drops in several situations in docked mode. Hopefully this can be fixed in a future patch.
Some design issues regarding the controls: If you find a new weapon and have no free slot in your weapon inventory, you have to open up the inventory in the pause menu and drop one weapon. Why is it not possible to drop weapons in the quick select menu?
Uncomfortable Cooking: If you want to cook something, you have to open up the pause menu, navigate to the ingrediants, switch to 'hold in hand mode', select the ingrediants, exit the menu and finally cook the meal. Why is it not possible to simply stand next to a cooking pot and by the press of a button open up a menu to select the ingrediants for your meal.
Durability of most of the weapons: Sure, the mechanic makes sense, since it forces you to find more and more weapons and use several fighting techniques because you will not always have a weapon for the battle style you prefer, but at the same time this reduces the joy of finding a new weapon because you know it will not last for long.

Invalid cons taken from negative 'reviews':
""No actual sprawling dungeons"" - Yeah, but there were dungeons in previous Zelda games that you had to visit over and over again. 120 shrines, each with unique puzzles spread all over the game world vs. a hand full of dungeons you have to spend a lot of time in - pick one.
""You are supposed to enter your own name"" - No, link is actually the character's name. The feature giving a custom name does not make too much sense because the character (sex, visual appearence...) can not be changed.
""They nerfed the Gamepad functionality"" - Second screen does not make any sense in gaming. It only distracts from what happens on the main screen.
""The game designers clearly had much contempt for the Zelda series"" - I will not comment on this.
""wow healthbar above npc"" - We had this before and what is bad about it?
""No animation while opening chest"" - Do you remember opening chest in Wind Waker and wating several seconds for each to reveal its secret? How many times did you enjoy this?
""Theres no second quest"" - Simply not true. Play the game!
""objects between the camera and the character are allways solid"" - This is simply wrong.

Of course there are some negative aspects by other users that I do not list here. Mostly because they are results of purely personal preference. And in general I want to say that every complaint about the game being open world is not worth the time reading it. The series has originally been open world and would have been all the time if possible.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I just got to the first (insert thing here that might be spoiler) and I am super excited to fight it. The game is really good at transitioning from easy to hard, and nothing feels too challenging or too easy. Overall so far a great game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ChrisAcoltzi,08-03-2017,"I actually played ocarina of time when it first came out, and it was amazing. For a long time it was the best game ever made for me, since then very few games would actually match that ""magic"" that ocarina had.
Fast forward 19 years later and we finally have a game that captures all that magic again.
Everything about this game feels like old Zelda, yet it manages to keep things very fresh. You are in a kingdom that has been there for hundreds of years, it shows on the places you visit... I have been playing this series for years and its like the series has grown up with you.

Yes it has some some minor technical problems, yes it may not be for everyone... but getting lost in this game its a joy that no other game has offered. It borrowed different elements from games like the witcher and skyrim, but with a zelda touch that makes things feel fresh.
The game has no hand holding and everything is done in a grand scale, the bosses are some of the best in the series. You never feel like you are in control of the world and thats actually a good thing.

After been disappointed with games like wind waker and twilight princess, we finally have a game that is actually better than ocarina of time, one that is definetly a bench mark for the series.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
1337brian,08-03-2017,"I can still remember the first time I played the original Legend of Zelda on the NES and how it felt to explore what seemed like an endless world filled with surprises and challenges and this game has brought back that feeling and then some. First I’ll get out of the way that coming from a PC with 144hz monitor ultra settings for graphics and frame rate above 100fps the switch is a small step back from what I’m used to in my normal gaming life but that doesn't take away from what is most likely the game of the decade. This game is AMAZING.

From the opening sequence you realize that something has happened to Hyrule and your tasked with finding out who you are and what's happened to the land around you. Breathtaking visuals, plenty of challenges spread across the land and scenery that is just jaw dropping. This game has it all.

The difficulty is up there and makes me glad as I like a challenge and there is a lot to do if you want to 100% the game. The story is one of the best in any video game I've ever played and put together so well. You become a part of the story organically, you're not forced through it like other games.

10/10 best story driven game I've played in over a decade.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BotBearGaming,08-03-2017,"Zelda is back and bigger than ever. Let me first start of that I love this game but I was a little skeptical after Skyward Sword on the Wii. I have been a huge fan of Zelda since the NES and this brings me back to that original game. After the games tutorial area and first four shrines you are free to go where ever you want and if skilled enough can go straight to Ganon and put him down, but that's not me I want to enjoy the world and story. So many reviews are saying Zelda has no story the gameplay sucks ect and to me those are all false statements and I believe a lot of the negative reviews are fakes and haters (my opinion). The game has a story you just have to search for parts of it to understand the deeper narrative which gives me a Dark Souls feel, the game is no where near easy nor holds your hand like so many games these days as I find myself freely exploring and getting one shot by enemies. The game is not without flaws occasionally I do have frame rate drops but that for me is maybe only once every few hours so not enough for me to lower my rating. Overall this a great installment for the Zelda franchise and with the Switch I would say Nintendo is back on the road to success.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
petetoddderson,08-03-2017,"Admittedly I'm a Zelda fan, as I've played every major console game since before I could even read the old man's cryptic hints.

Faeyas,08-03-2017,"10 from me. I have a few Zelda games, and while I adored Ocarina, others were luke-warm. Breath of the Wild is a ""breath"" of fresh air in the series. It reminds me of other stellar games like The Witcher 3, or Skyrim. I enjoy the lack of hand holding, the joy of exploration, and the self pacing.

I was wrong. Breath of the Wild is breathtaking and immersing. BotW has beaten OoT in my eyes as best Zelda game ever and is in my opinion the best game ever made. This game is totally worth your money and all the hours you'll put in it.
Another positive thing is that this game is for the first time in the series available in Dutch and I am Dutch speaking. I, I just love this game.

This game is perfect for RPG veterans because Nintendo finally decided to bring link's adventure back to it's root, but also very suitable for beginners due to it's fresh and modern gameplay and features.

It also has an amazing cooking feature and it is personally one of my favorite parts for some reason. This game is a must buy for Switch or Wii U owners and if you have a PS4, Xbox One, or PC I really wish you guys had this game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Instygan,08-03-2017,"The amount of people giving negative reviews just because they are mad at the fact that the game has such a high score is sickening, I thought games were about fun but clearly there are people who like to ruin it.

I picked up the Switch and Breath of the Wild during launch and I am currently still playing after 6 days, The game is fantastic, one of the best I've ever played. The console itself isn't my favorite but it is still a lot of fun.

Breath of the Wild has a wide range of things to do that will keep you busy for probably way over 100 hours considering how long I've been playing. It's open world boasts a large play area for players to test mechanics in the game and learn things that can be helpful to them later on. Shrines dotted around the world give the players a goal to try and conquer each one, including the shrine quests which make them much more interesting trying to solve riddles that are given to you from NPCs scattered around in different towns and towers. The sheer amount of detail that Nintendo have packed into this little cartridge is mind blowing with the realistic mechanics that you need to use. Overall for the world it will keep you occupied for a while making it hard to get bored whether it be cooking, horse riding, shield surfing, exploring, collecting and the list goes on and on.

The story line is good, not the best but it is good. I think they are saving the story for the DLC packages that are being released later on throughout the year, I'm not a huge fan of DLC but I'm interested in how Nintendo will deliver the new story line. The character development is nice as the game dives into the history of important characters in the game through very good story lines in quests which will all add up to the end game. Memories are also a great part of the game, as Link has no memory he must regain it by searching around the massive world learning new and old things which pieces the puzzle together after many, many hours of exploration and quests.

Performance wise, the game is OK for the majority of the game although SOME areas challenge the Switch it doesn't ruin the overall experience although I can understand why some people are annoyed by it but it is very short bursts that occur rarely. The patch fixed most of these issues.

Overall, Breath of the Wild boasts the true creativity that the team behind Nintendo hold, I have to say that Nintendo have many talented developers that are loyal workers considering the dark age they went through during the Wii U's lifetime they still have the ambition and motivation to deliver greatness. After 5 long years waiting for the game it was definitely worth every penny and yet still there are many side quests and shrine quests that I still need to do.

This is in my top 5 games I've ever played, considering I've never played a Zelda game before this I was surprised as to how much I loved it and understood some references that they sneaked in making the world of Hyrule a wonderful place to delve into.

tonybavala,09-03-2017,"Unlike most people, I have actually beat the game. And wow, what a game. I'll be honest and admit that I'm a huge Zelda dork and have been my entire life. However, I really did not care for Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. I feel that this game is a return to form for Nintendo. It's brilliant in its own Nintendo way. I've played the other recent big titles. Loved Horizon Dawn. Fantastic game. But I'm absolutely enamored with Breath of the Wild. I'd probably give it a 9.5/10 due to the frame rate issues. But hey, if I have to choose between 9 and 10, I'll definitely give it a 10. I feel like this is a game that everyone can enjoy. I know many younger gamers grew up with a dislike for Nintendo. I say, give them a try. The gameplay mechanics are nothing like what you'll find on a Sony/Xbox title. People are nostalgic for this series, because it is a phenomenal series. And this game just made that much more apparent. Bravo Nintendo. Well done. I'll be exploring the wilderness for years to come.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AdaptiveMantis,09-03-2017,"This is a worthy entry to the franchise. The sense of freedom and scale are really quite amazing. However, I cannot help but feel that the world seems rather empty. To be sure, it is a world at the brink of destruction, and it might be exactly the kind of feeling the developers wanted to convey, but nonetheless, I cannot help but notice that besides the stables, a few villages/towns and the odd travelling merchant, Link leads a rather solitary life.
Combat feels good, but not quite as tight as former entries to the series. But BotW marks a departure from the old Zelda formula so it is fair to give it a set of completely new mechanics as well.

gvargas,09-03-2017,"At first, I didn't like it. I thought that the open world took away the Zelda charm that I had grown to love. But as I played, I discovered that the charm was still there, you just had to discover it. This game is very unique from past Zelda games. You don't follow a scripted narrative that tells you where to go. You discover the story as you play it. You meat a great variety of people in the game, who add onto this narrative. The sense of adventure is just out of this world. You start off immediately on the Great Plateau and discover each piece of land little by little. Nintendo's fingerprint are all over this world. Chop down a tree to cross a gap. Use Magnesis to pull a metal bridge out of the water. It's a perfect game to get lost in.

Professor_x,09-03-2017,"As i started playing the game, one of the first things that caught my eye was how vast the world looked.

After playing past the starting area I started to see what really set this game apart, As much as i traveled i was always introduced to new environments and scenery. Not only did this add a diverse beauty to the game but it had a real impact on the game play as well, things like the rain making the hills slippery and countless others. I didn't want to compare it to another game, because each game has its own value, but this game makes Fallout4 seem like a indie game, a game which I have 100hours on. It manage to have all these amazing features, but they're polished virtually perfect! Creating an amazing sense of immersion and entertainment. 10/10 I dare to say best game in its genre I have ever played, and without a doubt game of the year. So far i have ~30hours.

bobjamison94,09-03-2017,"I wasn't going to leave a review until I had 100% the game. But all these troll reviews are making it seem necessary. This game is extraordinary. It encompasses everything I love about Zelda into an open world design and nails it perfectly. The shrines are seriously the most underrated aspect of it. I love how they require you to manipulate your surroundings using the acquired rune abilities. Me and my wife are both playing the game, and we've come up with different solutions to the same puzzles. The enemies start off pretty easy but once you jump off the Plateau, you're going to have to deal with Guardians, Yiga Clan, Lizalfos, etc. The scenery in the game is amazing. It rewards climbing and traversing the land like no other open world. Climb up a mountain, spot a shrine in the distant horizon, and paraglide your way. I definitely recommend this game. I also recommend that people ignore the negative troll reviews. We know that they are all fake and a result of the ""console war."" Just wish gamers were more mature.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
robertderp,09-03-2017,"Let me break down why this is my favorite game of all time

-Beautiful open world. Every part of this game is within the sandbox (with the exception being the shrines). Your ability to climb and swim is limited by stamina. But there is no limit to the freedom

-Enemies are finally tough again. Ever since Zelda switched to 3d, the level of difficulty completely vanished. Just look at how hard the first two Zeldas were in comparison. It really seems like they geared this game to an older demographic.

-The ability to shoot your arrow on horseback is so well done. Horses will follow the path you gallop on. This is extremely useful when fighting other enemies on horseback and the guardians.

-Shrines are very unique. The reviews claiming their copy and paste and complete lies. Literally every shine is different. Some are combat oriented. Some rely on just one of your runes. There is nothing ""copy and paste"" about them

-Weapon variety. I love that weapons break. It gives a whole new strategy to the game. You've got to choose weaker weapons for weaker enemies and save the good stuff for the real fights. Don't know why so many people hate this mechanic. It's brilliant.

-In game physics. There is a lot of detail in the game. You can tie your bomb to an octorock and blow the bomb into the enemy using a Deku leaf. This game almost feels like Just Cause at times. And in a good way.

Please ignore the trolls.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
newsting,12-03-2017,"If you've finished this game you cannot rate it a zero... That is so hypocritical and mindless, a zero in my mind has to be totally unplayable or pointless, this game is neither. That being said the worst that it should be rated is around a 4 or a 5. Honestly, some people's kids....",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jotawonka,13-03-2017,"As a fan of Zelda (I've played almost every one of them since GBC) I have to say that this is far the biggest and most beautiful Zelda game ever made with a totally fresh new concept, but still with the same repetitive storyline and, again, a princess that needs to be ""rescued"" or well more or less, since she is also fighting the enemy in some way.

Apart from that and also considering that I don't like the fact that weapons break, and break a lot (at the point that I could not continue at some part in the game) and also considering that I waste a lot of time climbing and walking... after all that I consider this game a masterpiece of art and beauty everywhere, which compensates all those negative parts. The music and general FX ambience is also nice and it isn't repetitive because it's very subtle.

Definitely Nintendo should consider in the future to bring a new storyline like they did with Majora, Minish Cap, etc. the central story and the multiple universes are becoming very repetitive, and definitely they should also continue with this open world concept, but please make weapons more durable or at least being able to repair all of them.

I was between 8 and 9 (8.5 let's say) , but considering how many undeserved zeros it has got, I will give it a 9. Also because the more I am playing it, the more I like it and the more I am close to that 9 or even more.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Mushy_,20-03-2017,"Zelda Breath Of The Wild was a game I was very hyped for and thought it would be by far game of the year but after completely finishing the game and putting over 70 hours into the game I can say that i'm no more than genuinely Disappointed with this game. Is it a bad game? NO. that's just not true. Is it one of the best games ever made? No. That's nothing more than an over exaggeration. This Zelda game is very different from most as some people can clearly tell but just because it's different doesn't mean it can completely gimp out on things that made this game's predecessors great, and this game not so great. The temples and bosses in this game feel watered down and are nothing more than slight variations from each other making the boss fights in the Divine beast extremely repetitive and just well, boring after you fight the final two and realize it's the same fight over and over again. The temples in this game are the same as well which is just a slap in the face for being a Zelda game. ""Oh, but the game is different than others so it has an excuse for having watered down puzzles."" That's not how a game works my friend just because you have a big open world doesn't mean you can water down THE BEST PART OF ZELDA the dungeons. In Ocarina Of Time when you became an adult and Ganondorf took over Hyrule there were still unique puzzles and bosses and a lot more of them for that matter. It's clear that when making this game the main focus was the open world so let's talk about the open world. For the most part I think the open world is brilliant and awesome there is a diversity of races and culture which reminds me a lot of Majora's mask and the overall open world of this game gives you a whole hell of a lot of time to explore and overall I found exploring to be one of the best parts about of this game. The combat is awesome face paced a variety of enemies and weapons to fight with making every fight different and heart pounding but the ONE thing that **** everything up was the weapon durability system. Oh god, the weapon durability in this game it's dreadful and one of the worst things about this game. There is nothing more frustrating and unfair. Let's say you get a really cool weapon only to have it taken away after killing five enemies. It's like the game punishing you for having fun with the new toy that you just got for Christmas it's stupid. Should the player be constantly punished for using the weapons that they like to use in a video game? Sorry, I just don agree with that. One thingiI've heard a lot of people say is that the weapon durability is a way for you to use different weapons and learn how to use them all and to that I say if the game needs to force you to use different weapons on enemies you're just a closed-minded person who doesn't want to change their playstyle, but why should the game force you to do this at all its an open world game after all. Okay now to the juicy stuff the story but like a juicy steak that has been left out in the sun for 5 years you can say it's dry as **** The story is extremely forgettable, bland and overall seems like somewhat of an unfinished piece. In fact, this whole game feels like that it just seems unfinished and yet people are giving this game 10/10 nonstop which I just don't understand. My overall experience with this game was positive within my first 20 hours but after finishing the game and doing all there is to do the story aspect just seems unsatisfying. The ending isn't satisfying at all AND YES I DID GET THE (true ending) and that statement is no less true than saying skyward swords motion controls aren't annoying. Zelda seems like a cool character I want to interact with but you only see her in cutscenes making the game extremely unsatisfying and just *sigh* pointless. Still waiting on a good end to a Zelda game Nintendo Still waiting. Okay I know I've been extremely negative in this review so let's focus on some stuff that I like okay :). The cooking in this game is deep, cool, and overall a welcome replacement to just finding hearts on the ground or drinking a potion. The enemies all have different and unique attack patterns which were extremely enjoyable when fighting them. and Once again the exploration in this game is by far some of the best in any open world game. Hopefully, the DLC for this game can save it from its poor story and hav e a different dungeon that is actually cool and unique so yeah hopefully there will be that.

ninjamasterdave,24-03-2017,"I am a lifelong gamer, started once I was 4 in 1984. So I have been around and have childhood memories of the Zelda franchise. I liked the original but wasn’t a super fan. More of a Mario kid. Haha I enjoyed Zelda 2 as a kid, and Zelda 3 was the one to really pull me in. Playing through A link to the past is one of my favorite gaming memories. Then the n64 versions and others all came out, and I just did not resonate at all. However. I do love completely immersive video gaming. That is what I am ultimately going for with every purchase. Hoping a game could make me forget about time and space and just get sucked into an experience with a sense of awe and wonder. I loved the late MMO Asherons Call for that reason. But have found games of that magical magnitude are few and far between.

I also own a ps4, xbox one, and switch. So I am not a ‘fan boy’. I have been a huge advocate of gaming since forever and enjoy many forms of creative expression, even if it doesn’t give me the same ‘immersed in a world of awe’ feeling.

Enough of the credentials – let’s talk about Zelda.

From the moment I turned on this game, the rest of the world disappeared. I was so fully immersed in this beautiful world that would let me do anything and go anywhere. The sounds, the art, the animation, it all just draws you in. The feeling you get from being able to go anywhere and do anything, running into mysterious characters helping you along your way gave me continuous chills. I was so afraid that I was wasting $400 on a switch and this game, but my fears were put to rest immediately after starting.

Because this feeling that some video games, movies, and other forms of art are so elusive and difficult to explain, and may even be different for everyone, I can’t promise that it will also give you that feeling, but it gave it to me. And while I have enjoyed many, many, many games for so many different reasons (I have 180 PS4 games, including horizon), this game is so refreshing, and so life-giving, that I can only compare it to how I felt when I first started playing Asherons Call. If you were lucky enough to be a part of that game you will know what I mean.

Zelda is an awe-inspiring experience, and while people will knit pick over things like how the control feels, etc, it's all perfect to me. Pure Nintendo magic.

That’s all I’m gonna say. Because, the less you know, the better. Just go in there and make this experience your own, and stop watching youtube videos showing gameplay. ;)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jknight777,24-03-2017,This is quite possibly the best game Ive played in the last few years. Every time I pick up the controller its a new adventure waiting to happen. I can not tell you how enjoyable this game is to play.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Niqualio,02-06-2017,"I was expecting a great Zelda game, what I got was one of my favourite games of all time. The world is huge and filled with adventures. There are so many things to explore. It is amazing. To me this game is damn near perfect. The only thing that I am not happy with is the lack of dungeon varieties. The dungeons were so good in the past games but this game has the worst dungeons. The whole Zelda formula has now changed for the better. Next time, I'd like Dungeons and I will give this game 11/10 but now I'll give it the perfect 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
EvilLinkD,12-06-2017,"I've played a lot of open world games and RPG: Skyrim, The Witcher 3, Fallout, Assassin's Creed, DarkSouls, Final Fantasy, etc. I have been always a fan of this type of genre and I have enjoyed a lot of these games.

Also, I am experienced in all the Zelda Universe, though I have played the 3D titles only (OoT, MM, WW, TP, etc) and have never touched the 2D ones (ALTTP, The Legend of Zelda, etc). So, I wanted to play this game without any external influence of the critics nor wanted to spoil the story and gameplay. After 100 hours of gameplay, finishing the story and travel through all the world map, I can state that this can be defined as a MASTERPIECE. Nintendo created a game that reflects a true living world. I got lost within its magic, its compelling characters, the art style (oh! those unforgettable twilights), the dynamic combat, the treasures and yes, the best of all, the freedom that the physics engine provides you. The possibilities are endless.

Although, I want to clarify that the music is exquisite and synchronizes perfectly with the world, but it is not as great as the music from other Zelda titles. Also, the story could have been polished and could have been defined with a more complex and intriguing plot. Overall, I can state that it is one of the greatest games created of the decade, and I would declare (from my personal opinion) that it is in the same level as OoT, if not higher.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
coltdogster,04-01-2020,The most fun I ever had in a video game was when I stepped outside in this game and saw that world in front of me. I've played every Zelda and I'm a superfan. This game.. absolutely deserves a play.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
edstead,06-05-2017,"This is without a doubt one of the best open world games I have ever played. So many open world games claim to be just that, open world, but still like to hold your hand and guide you around. Zelda 100% does not do that. The world is yours to explore, to take on in any order you please and it feels truly great to be able to do that.

The combat is fun and challenging, the puzzles are everywhere, some are quite simple, others will have you thinking for a while. And as you would expect there's plenty of cool things hidden around the world for you to discover. I love that quests don't just rely on putting a marker on your map, they give you directions and it's up to you to figure it out.

If you own a switch, you simply have to have this game.

I can't quite give it a 10/10. More like a 9.5 as it's missing a few small features that I think would really round it off into the perfect game. For example it would be great if there was a GTA/WoW style stats tracker, that could tell you how many of certain enemies you've killed, how long you've spent playing, etc. etc.

I also think a Monster Hunter style recipe book (i.e. it only tells you a recipe once you've already made it once) would also work really well in this game.

But this game is already worth its value, and that is set to be extended with some DLC in Summer and Winter. Simply a must buy!",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mijan,08-01-2020,"Good game but I simply don't see what is so special about this game, it looks okayish, you can see it's Wii U port, framerate is very inconsistent and open worlds games of this scale are maybe novelty just for Nintendo users.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MikeZillaGames,16-04-2017,"You've probably seen a lot of reviews focusing on the positives of this game. Yes, it's a great game. Yes, I've played just about every single game in the series, and this one surprised me with it's quality and how fresh it felt. So, I figured I'd pick on the game's weaker points.

My only issues with the game are:
-Difficulty: Can vary wildly and spike dramatically in certain places. You might be breezing through the game only to arrive at the ""stealth"" section of the game only to find yourself have problems. Thankfully there's only one of those.
-Bosses: always a staple of the series, but here your most challenging opponents are more likely to be certain regular enemies in the world...some of which, I swear, hit WAY harder than Calamity Ganon himself.
-Inventory: There's just a lot of stuff to micro-manage here, from clothing to ingredients and so on. Luckily the crafting system is rewarding to fool around with.
-Combat is excellent, but I feel that breakage of weapons, especially early in the game, is a hassle to deal with.

Can't think of much else. This is a must own title for anyone with the console to support it.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
toaplan,30-04-2018,"Amazing reinvention of the Zelda series and the whole open-world genre. Looks absolutely beautiful on the Switch and the sparse soundtrack is delightful also. I loved the new dungeons i.e. divine beasts, the game's innovative and realistic physics and the cooking system. I liked the shrines too, although more emphasis on quality instead of quantity would've been better, as many of the shrines were quite samey. The main quest was a bit on the short side and over relatively quickly. However, side quests, hunting for armor sets and wanting to explore every part of the enchanting game world extended my playtime considerably.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Seann,05-05-2018,A great game for the Switch and a wonderful addition to the Zelda series- but the end game leaves it feeling empty and bland- even with the DLC.,8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Erime,09-01-2020,"An absolute beauty. This is an open world game that you can play for hours and hours without getting tired. Everything in the game is found for accident, as you really feel the sense of exploring and curiosity that the original Zelda intended, finding and collecting every material in your path. The graphics are amazing, the open world is beautiful, and the game-play and mechanics are better than anything seen before. The voice acting is not perfect but good for being the first time in the franchise.

In my opinion, Game of the Year for sure and should definitely pick it up if you’re a Switch owner.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
scorp332211,01-03-2021,"I’m sorry but this is one of the most BORING games of all time! It’s not great at all. You have to walk/run for miles before getting to an objective once you leave the first area. There are no horses to be found. The landscape is also barren- nothing to see or do between getting from one quest to the next. Then there’s the stamina system which stinks. You have to climb mountains to get to your destination, but you have to be careful you have enough stamina to do it. You even use stamina when paragliding which is ridiculous. The fast travel system is also terrible depending on where you need to go- there’s not always one even to get back to a place you’ve been before. Then there’s the one hit kills by enemies which also stinks. It’s so easy to die in this game, and I’m a very experienced game player. Overall I found the whole thing very frustrating- it’s not fun. Everyone says it’s one of the best games of all time- but I don’t give it more than a 1/5 or 1/10. There are so many better rpg’s out there- so don’t waste your time or money on this one!",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
badgerryan19,16-07-2017,"This is an amazing game. There is so much to do it's almost overwhelming at points. This is my first Zelda game. Yes get the gasps out now, but I see why this game series is one of the most beloved game series of all time. The story is so awesome and Link is such a badass. The side stories are all rich with story and a blast to do. There is not one dull moment in this game and there is always something to do. I literally bought the Nintendo Switch to play this game. Had to pay a little extra plus the game. So roughly $450 for Zelda. And oh man was it worth it. This is one of the most memorable games I have played in a while. Wow! there is already so many great GOTY contenders and this becomes one of them on that list.

Masterpiece.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Man-Rata,18-07-2019,"This game is mediocre, which is really sad because it got very good potential. I love Zelda games, but this, this isn’t really that good.

Good:
- Large open world
- You can climb, and climb more or less anything, and easily get around. Except in dungeons/shrines, because that would be to easy.
- I like the graphics, nothing spectacular, but it’s good.
- Really nice weather system
- Most information is easily available on the main HUD

Meh:
- The story is bland, but this is a Zelda game, so Link have to save the princess. Beyond that there really isn’t anything, or rather what there is, is a clear set of obstacles to prolong the game.

Bad:
- Some of the weather, like rain and thunderstorms becomes extremely frustrating. Rain stops you from climbing, and lightning can outright kill you, and sometimes you are stuck waiting out the weather. Not a good mechanic.
- Everything is sooo slow, picking up a rock, climbing, even swinging weapons feels slow, especially when you have to cut grass to get crickets or the like.
- Cooking, seriously Nintendo, WTF. So first I have to gather ingredients, then I have to find a cooking spot, get fire there. Then go to my inventory, select up to 5 things, cook them. Again with a slow animation. Meaning optimally it takes 15-20 seconds per item you cook, and you have to go to inventory every time. And it doesn’t save the recipes, you can see them on the item you cooked, but once that is consumed It’s gone. Seriously this literally made me not play the game for over a month, not fun in any shape or form.
- Weapons break, fast, sometimes after 5-6 hits on enemies. Even legendary, ancient weapons just fall apart after hitting even low level enemies. Bows and shields too, and you can’t just buy new, you have to find it. This is not fun, and it just drains you, often ran from enemies, because they would cost me weapons to kill. Seriously not funny. If they broke after 20-30 hits, then maybe, but breaking 7-8 weapons during a long fight gets tedious.
- Inventory space is limited, it can be expanded by finding seeds, there is 900 of them, but you max. inventory after 441. But still, for most of the game you are maybe able to carry 10 weapons, and you need to carry a couple of specific weapons.
- The menus, and handling of menus is mind boggling, whoever came up with this, is probably praising Morrowinds inventory system, and menus.
- Everything is the same, yeah the landscape. Changes a little, but there are 5-6 different monsters effctively. There are a lot of shrines (mini dungeons) and they are basically identical. Same walls, same everything except the physics puzzles, or combat.
- Very little direction in the beginning. I found the game quite frustrating the first hours after getting to the two first villages. Tried wandering in random directions, and were killed hard by everything, until ai finally walked in the right direction.

This was a lot of complaining, but I do like to play it, but it’s not perfect, it has many many flaws.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mefzeldernx,10-02-2018,"Reinventar la saga es decir poco, ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" es sin lugar a dudas el juego más revolucionario de los últimos años. El género de los mundos abiertos ha recibido un ejemplo de como hacer una aventura libre y única para cada jugador.
Las físicas son las principales protagonistas del 10, los efectos de sonido, la gravedad sobre los objetos, la inteligencia artificial, el clima son elementos que dejan anonadado una vez que comienzas a experimentar con los objetos. Este es uno de los pocos juegos donde la historia es una de las cosas más secundarias dentro del contenido, es seguro que al aventurarte contra Ganon la curiosidad te lleve a los lugares menos pensados del mapa.
Sin lugar a dudas un juego esencial si te haces con la nueva Nintedo Switch o tienes la Wii U.
La versión de Switch es impecable, la jugabilidad es igual en modo portátil como en el dock, aún mejor si tienes el juego actualizado ya que refina el framerate de ciertas áreas que antes presentaban problema.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Locke_Cole,16-01-2018,"Breath of the Wild dista mucho de ser un juego perfecto, o aún más de ser un juego excelente en todos sus apartados. Su historia es interesante, pero está mal desarrollada, la jugabilidad en los combates es tosca y está poco enfocada. Técnicamente está lejos de la actual generación. Hay muchos santuarios poco inspirados.

Aún así es una obra maestra y merece todos los 10 que se le dan.

Varias veces he dicho que un juego no debe ser perfecto para merecer la máxima nota, debe ser una obra maestra, un fuera de serie para merecerla. Y vaya que BOTW es un fuera de serie, antes dije muchos de sus defectos, pero todos quedan totalmente opacados por todas las virtudes de este juego, que son muchas y a la vez pueden ser resumidas en una sola frase: la sensacion de aventura.

Hay muchos sistemas en este juego, podría diferenciarlos en tres: sistema de equipamiento, de fisicas del mundo, y de cocina. Los tres están tan increiblemente logrados que abruman. No caeré en detalles, que para eso están los gameplays y análisis mas prolongados. Pero solo estos tres sistemas representan un paso hacia adelante tan grande para la industria de los videojuegos que deja cáducos a todos los anteriores. El de Breath of the Wild es un mundo tan amplio y detallado que asusta al pensar en sus dimensiones, no por amplio, no por lleno de cosas que hacer, no por iconos en el mapa; lo es por lo inmersivo, lo inspirado y la curiosidad que despierta para seguir explorándolo.

Y esa esa la mayor virtud de este juego, la exploración, la investigación, la experimentación que despierta al ser jugado, el mirar al horizonte y pensar en qué hay allá. El ver un santuario desde la parte mas alta de una montaña congelada. Está muy lleno de pequeños momentos que te hacen tener una experiencia como nunca antes tuve en un videojuego.

Creo que BOTW es una obra maestra que todo el mundo debe jugar, y uno de los grandes de la historia de los videojuegos. En el aspecto por el que este juego apuesta es, probablemente, el mejor de la historia. Y lo digo de manera muy sincera, pues aunque opino todo esto, no lo hago desde el ser fanboy, Mario y Final Fantasy son las unicas sagas de las que me considero fan. Lo digo porque , desde mi opinion, acá ha habido un paso de gigantes.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Chlawl,10-03-2017,"This game is truly amazing. I let myself get a little bummed out by the negative reviews, and then I actually played the game. Don't let yourself get sucked in to their hate. If you want a game that gives you one story quest and 5 side quests to complete before you get the next story quest and 5 side quests, this is not the game for you. If you want a game that you can explore and get sucked in to, this is the game for you.

In the beginning of the game I felt lost, and I felt like I wasn't clearing the content fast enough to make me feel accomplished. Then I realized how silly that feeling was, and that I had been conditioned to feel that way by every other open world game in the past. This is likely the feeling that all of the negative reviewers are feeling as well, and they just haven't evolved past it.

This involves traveling throughout the land, and restoring control over the Divine Beasts, mechanical machines made to combat the evil Ganon. That's the most I can give away before diving into spoilers. The game really sets itself apart from previous Zelda titles in the way it tells the story. You discover the story as you play.

Ziggy93,25-04-2017,"One of the closest to perfection game starts that I have ever played.

The world is immersive and highly interactive. I found there is so much potential creative ways to play this game. Your tools, unlike previous Zelda games, have been designed to interact with the world in numberless ways. I find myself creating new ways to defeat a horde of enemies much later into the game.

The story is really impressive. I feel as though they have designed the world to be quite spacious and have an empty and wild feel to it, in a way that you want to explore and discover the story yourself. I rarely find myself wanting to speak to people in game, but this game make sure you feel like very dialogue is a nugget of gold. This could be seen as a negative, but I think it makes it all the more exciting.

The graphics are great, for me at least they are absolutely fine. However for those that prefer more extreme realistic and hyper intense graphics, you might be disappointed. But they have made huge improvements from previous games.

The music is also impressive, and I find myself occasionally returning to areas to listen again.

The game packs a punch with great mechanics, nice graphics and a huge open world that is crafted in a way that just makes you want to explore more and more. You will often catch yourself just running around exploring the world, looking around for more korok seeds or shrines, or just spending five minutes climbing that big mountain just to slide down on a shield.

This isn't Witcher. It won't make you take tough moral decisions. It won't amaze you with great story. The game is more of a sandbox, which is whatever you make out of it. You can finish the game just after the tutorial. You can try to beat the shrines in the ways creators never imagined. You can defeat enemies in different creative ways. You can collect crickets.

Al igual que Ocarina of Time creó maneras de jugar de las cuales los juegos de hoy aún siguen imitando, este The Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild nos enseña como debe ser y como debe hacerse un juego en mundo abierto con el que por supuesto ahora las compañías utilizarán de inspiración y como referente a seguir.

The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild es una obra maestra única e inolvidable que perdurará en tu corazón para siempre. Un juego que te inundará de sentimientos maravilloso con su belleza, te abrumará con la infinidad de contenido y pequeños detalles hasta tal punto que siempre te parecerá que necesitas más tiempo para seguir jugando. Allí donde vallas encontrarás algo o habrá algo que hacer. Nada es al azar, todo tiene un porqué y tendrás libertad absoluta para ir donde quieras y hacer prácticamente cualquier cosa que se te ocurra.

wolfie79,28-03-2018,"This is one of the most perfect games I've ever played. Theres a few bad things, but they are so little and also so overblown by the positive that even now I cannot point out one. Other games aren't open world.... THIS is how you create an open world game. And you wont know until you play it. The freedom, the void, the attitude shows through the entire game. The DLC seem like crap though, but I'd gladly throw money freely at this game just to make sure other developers pay attention to how you do it!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lemonade1408,16-11-2017,"Fantastic game, everything you could hope for as a Zelda fan

It does brake with tradition quite a bit but it doesn't suffer

My only two minor gripes, and this stops it getting a ten, are the weapon stamina mechanic where they break after a set use and the fact the main dungeons are only numbered 4 (5 if you count the castle) OofT had 3 then 7 and the end boss

But minor gripes as the mini shrines make up for that, the best fun I had was just wondering around exploring, my tip is to buy the expansion as you get a trail mechanic on the map to show where you have already been. The DLC is a first for a Zelda game I cant say too much as the main part of it isnt out until next month",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Eebrohim,22-04-2018,"I have put over 200 hours into the game and every hour is well spent. From the beautiful open world packed with so many things to do, with the emphasis on adventure and exploration that most open world games seem not leave out, to the new take on the Zelda formula, the game continues to amaze me even to this day. What's even better is that the £17.99 DLC adds hundreds of hours of more content, especially with the new Master Mode, giving me a reason to re-play the game. My only issue with the game is that I have encountered a glitch with a Korok puzzle that is stopping me from getting that 100% that I deserve!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SortOfCritic,29-12-2017,"I think we need more games like Breath of the Wild. Not entirely different from the source, but gives its own spin as to create a potentially incredible experience. Breath of the Wild was that game for me and is my favorite Legend of Zelda video game. The fact that you can climb anywhere gives an overall feeling of excitement, knowing you can go where ever you want. The fact that you can fight the villain right off the bat is a testament to how open and free it is. I find myself comparing this game more to Skyrim than Ocarina of Time. And I think that's wonderful.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
KoolWhip64,29-12-2017,"This game is just incredible. Absolutely mind-blowing. By far the greatest Zelda game, and that's not easy to do. In fact, in my personal opinion, it's the best video game ever. By now, you've probably read a few reviews, and I'll bet you're aware of most of the things that make this game such a masterpiece (freedom of exploration, physics engine, content, cooking, attention to detail in how the world works, ect. If you're not aware of these things, I suggest you read IGN's review). So, since there is a 5000 character limit, In this review, I am going to talk about the points brought up against this game. There are some mixed and even negative reviews here, so I'll discuss their points.

Weapon durability: Any negative review for this game will almost certainly bring up the weapon durability system. In this game, weapons can break. This is not a new concept, Minecraft is probably the most popular example of weapons breaking in a video game. The main difference between games like Minecraft and Breath of the Wild is how long a weapon will last. In Breath of the Wild, weapons break very quickly. You'll be going through weapons all the time. While in some cases it is realistic, like the fact that a tree branch will break in about 3 strikes, most of the time, weapons break much faster than you would think. A shiny new metal sword will only last you a few minutes in combat. Is this a bad thing though? Absolutely not. You see, the point of this game is exploration. The main point is to explore, and the game rewards you for doing so. One of the possible rewards is weapons. Obviously, there is a limit to the amount of weapons you can carry, even as it is, you can carry an unrealistic amount of weapons, as with most games. So, if the weapons were to last a long time, your inventory would quickly fill up with great weapons, taking away much satisfaction that you would have received for completing tasks or exploring. If you're constantly full on weapons, there would be no reward for many tasks. The game would become incredibly dull. The idea of the weapon durability system is to keep things interesting. Instead of having some cool sword and taking out an enemy camp with it, you might have a club from the last monster you killed, and you use it to take out the scout, then you may pick up his bow and shoot it at someone, then pick up their weapon and throw it at someone else, then switch to your cool sword, which will break as finish off the last guy, and then you are rewarded with a new cool weapon in a chest, along with all your enemies' weapons. This game's weapon durability system is different because this game is different. It fits the game perfectly. It causes you to think, explore, and get satisfaction from the many tasks you will do. There is nothing wrong with it, and if it were to be any other way, it would hurt the game overall. Yes, it is sad when your favorite sword breaks, but people don't realize the implications it would have on the game if things were the way they think they should be.

Story: Yes, sure, this isn't as major or emotional of a story-wise as some games out there. I think most people complaining about this game's story probably play a lot of JRPG's (Japanese Role-Playing Games), which are always heavy on story. To them, this game probably looks a bit like a JRPG, but it is not. It is an action-adventure open world game. The story probably could've been a bit better, but it is great as it is. It's not your average story. It is about some unknown dude who has lost all his memories, and wakes up in a post-apocalyptic world. You set off on your adventure, and slowly discover, not a story that is currently happening, but one that happened in your past, which you cannot remember. It is a pretty sad story actually. The point of the game is to discover that story at your own pace, then, at the end, resolve it, and repair the damage done to the world. That is all I will say, for fear of spoiling it.

""Barren World"": Give me a break! Please! Trust me, if you see that in a review, just know that that person has certainly either not played the game, or played it in such a way in which they absolutely ignored and missed everything (which the game will totally let you do, due to the freedom given you, you are not forced to do anything). Look online for IGN's interactive Hyrule map for this game, click ""marker categories"", then ""all"". It will show you every notable thing there is in the world. That is all that is needed to refute this ridiculous argument.

Music: I find it humorous that anyone could say that this game lacks good music. For most of the game, there are ambient piano melodies and environmental sounds, which suits the game perfectly, and makes it so relaxing and mesmerizing. However, there is no lack of great musical pieces, go check them out online for yourself.

So, why on earth are there so many people bashing these things about this game? One word: Trolls.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
RandomGuy102,06-01-2018,This was one of the few games this year that made me enjoy gaming. The game offers so many things to do. I played for over 150 hours and enjoyed every bit of it. This game alone is worth getting a switch for imo.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BlooperTanooki,20-03-2020,"Intimidating and nothing like Zelda used to be. Maybe that is why many more people hold it in the highest of regards. Be prepared to die countless times and change your point of view on the franchise if you are a seasoned Zelda player, though.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Timi7272,04-03-2018,"I've been playing the game for 100 hours, so I think I can review it as well.
Let's begin with the beginning of the game: Your adventure will start in a little cave, where link has slept for a long time. When you go outside the cave, you will see how huge and beautiful the world is. You will also see an old man who is standing by the fire. He will guide you at the beginning. But he doesn't explain you everything, you have to explore the first area for your own. In the first shrines you will get the probably most important items in the game. For example the stasis rune, that you can use to stop the time for almost all objects in the world. Later in the game, also for enemies. An other example is the magnesis rune, to lift up magnetic objects like some chests.
The tutorial is not long and annoying like in many other games, and the runes that you get at the beginning are gonna help you more than you think.
The last thing I wanna say, is, that you can really see that the game has been in development for many years. The normal mode (not the hard mode in the DLC) is really well balanced. Only that the weapons are getting wrecked a bit too fast. Especially in the beginning of the game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MootziIsABoss,05-03-2018,"Absolutely my favorite game I've played in a long time. Nintendo blew this one out of the park. The open world take and redoing the classic Legend of Zelda formula was a crazy risk, but Breath of the Wild passed with flying colors. I absolutely adore this game, it never gets boring.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SlightedHand,23-03-2018,"Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is legitimately refreshing. I know refreshing is such an overused word in the video game reviewing industry, but this game truly is. When I first started playing games 11 years ago, I first played Super Mario Galaxy, a game filled with creative dense environments. However after years of Nintendo Wii, I got an Xbox 360 and just like that I was sucked into the anti-consumer world of Triple A video games. COD, Assassins Creed, Fifa were all my top games and I was just waiting for each one to come out. And it wasn't until about two years ago when AC: Syndicate came out that I started drifting away. All of these games lacked the creativity, inventiveness and freedom that I really wanted to play with, and it wasn't until I bought the switch just to play this game that I felt that the video game market might actually still be fun. It is exactly like having a cold wet flannel rubbed on your face and then taken away. It is the game definition of refreshing. This game has almost no moments of repetition, every battle, every puzzle, and every bit of exploration is diverse and amazing. The shrines can be a bit of a grind but are still interesting enough individually to stay exciting. It's only if you try to tackle them all in one big rush like I did that they start to blur together. The divine beasts all are amazing, I honestly can't think of a criticism for them. The only point of this entire game that I felt should be changed or just removed completely was on of the Korok Trials which was a trailing mission that was just unpredictable and so monotonous. However that is a ten minute job in a game that was 100 hours for me. This game is revolutionary as an open world rpg as it condenses such a huge amount of mechanics, fights and puzzles into a big, beautiful map. Even the graphics are stunning with what you would imagine a 3D video game version of a Studio Ghibli would look like. This game deserves all the praise its getting and has hopefully redefined all of our opinions of what a Triple-A open world rpg looks like.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

quickarace,02-04-2018,Zelda Breath of the wild is such a good game.

thatoneguy_,21-04-2018,"As someone who has capped over 140+ hours of my time into this game, I can say that this game is a masterpiece in it's own regard. First, you can't compare this title to games like Ocarina of Time or Majora's Mask because of how different it is from those games genre-wise. Comparing this game to the last 5 home console entries in the series is like comparing first-person shooters to puzzle games. This game is a callback to the original formula that was shown in the original Zelda on the NES, which I though was great. The game itself has a good combat system and focuses heavily on exploration, unlike the previous linear entries on Nintendo's last three home consoles. You are also given a lot of freedom when it comes to how you want to do things and where you want to go, which is refreshing for this series. There were a few problems (like durability on weapons :/), but I mostly got over those over time. The game's story was not a big deal, as it just gives an almost generic story of good vs evil in the world of Hyrule. The story doesn't go all too deep either, with the cutscenes giving you an adequate amount of information on what is going on. But that isn't the point; Nintendo themselves said ""to forget everything you know about the Zelda series"", as it is more similar to the non-linear format shown in the original NES title. But despite not having a stellar story, the art style of the game is beautiful and exploring what Hyrule has to offer is really fun. It is a must-have for any Switch or Wii U owner and I would recommend playing it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

GlowFire,01-05-2018,"Zelda Breath Of The Wild starts with your first mission. This mission took me a while to complete, as I was still new the the controls of the Nintendo switch console. After completing your first quest you unlock some more abilities in the game. I was definitely impressed with the overall quality and creativity of the story the game told just in the first 30 minutes of playing. The cut scenes are unlike any other Zelda game I have seen and/or played. To get to the final battle , you have to fight your way through 4 dungeons and one boss each for every one dungeon. Getting to each dungeon is very tough, but also fun, and entertaining. Each dungeon has a different style, and different types of challenges and puzzles to complete. there is also a different type of boss each dungeon you enter. Each boss and dungeon correspond to a different element of the game as well. Fire, water, air, and earth.
Overall, this game impressed me. I would highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a thrilling yet challenging video game experience.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

LoomBoom,04-05-2018,"Breath of the Wild is one of the finest games I've ever played. I've been a Zelda fan since I was 4, and I've played all the games, but this is the Zelda game I've wanted ever since Wind Waker. The Zelda series was always been fantastic, but Skyward Sword is when I started to realize that the series' formula was reaching its limits and it needed change. Breath of the Wild brought the change the series needed. And it didn't just change how we think of Zelda games, but also how we think of open world games in general.

""The Wild"", that's the big draw to this game. BotW's open world is probably my favorite open world I've ever experience. It's filled with life, wonder, mystery, and beauty, and it's up to you how much you want to explore it all. To make exploring this open world even more fun is the tools you have at your disposal. From the start of the game you pretty much have access to all the necessary skills you need. You can jump, run, walk, glide, crouch, and climb, and best of you all, you can climb pretty much everywhere. Not to mention all the skills you can perform with your weapons and shields, you have it all from the beginning. Also shortly after playing, you gain access to using runes that give you additional abilities. Having all the necessary skills and weapons you need right from the start may seem strange, but it's actually liberating. BotW does not hold your hand and tell you how to use everything, you must get creative, learn how to use the environment to your advantage, and adapt. BotW encourages experimentation with your abilities and skills, and while everything is easy to learn, even after 200+ hours of playing I'm still amazed on how fresh everything feels and I never do one thing the same way every time.

BotW has a sense of freedom that I haven't experienced in any game ever. I can run around for hours pretty much doing nothing in the grand scheme of things, but it's a blast. BotW let's you take your time and explore. You can do any little task you want and complete the game in any order you feel like. You get to decide what type of journey you have. Every time I pick up and play Breath of the Wild it never feels boring or that its over stayed its welcome because you just get lost in its world. Anything that you see you can get to and anything you can think of doing, you can pretty much do thanks to the psychics engine. In this game, the physics engine is absolutely incredible. You'll play around with all the different possibilities you can do with the environment and you'll find interesting ways to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. I find fighting enemies so much fun in this game because I can defeat them in almost infinite different ways, it just never gets old.

Now, as for the characters, I'd say this version of Zelda is by far the best Zelda we've ever had. She has a great personality and is relatable . Someone who is burdened by her duty and has doubts in herself, but also someone who works tirelessly to achieve her goal. Plus her personality is very fun and sweet, she's extremely likable. Also Link is probably one of my favorite Links as well. He gets a bit of development too (and we even learn why he doesn't talk). His design and personality he gives in any given situation makes him pretty appealing, and he has the most emotion since Toon Link in Wind Waker. I think he's won the hearts of many is probably going to be the face of the franchise for some time, just as OoT and TP Link were. Outside of those two, the rest of the champions are intriguing and full of personality (Revali being my favorite), but we just didn't get to see a lot from them! Also the other side characters aren't too memorable besides some of the Zoras like Sidon and the Gerudo chief Riju. This also means there isn't as many side quests that really stand out. There are some fun ones for sure, but the ones that stick with you, just not too many. The Gerudo side quests I'd say were the most fun and memorable of the bunch though, I really liked the Gerudo region in general. But this game still hasn't been able to touch Majora's Mask with having the best side characters and side quests in the franchise. Wind Waker would be the runner-up.

The story works for this type of game and I like that you have to piece together everything that's happened, but its definitely not up there with some of Zelda's top stories. The relationship between Link and Zelda and the Champions are definitely the highlight.

But at the end of the day, BotW isn't that type of game that has a lot of emphasis on characters and story. You make your own journey and your own story, and the focus here is the world and your main objective. The pros far out weight the cons, and the cons are minuscule in comparison. BotW is one of the greatest games I've ever played and it's refreshing to play a game with so much freedom and trust in the player. Its one of the few open world games that keeps its core promise: ""open"".",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It is a shame, because if the developing team spent more time on designing side quests and more interesting characters, instead of focusing solely on making the world as big as possible, this would have been an amazing game the likes of Horizon Zero Dawn.

The weapon sistem, horrible, I don't want to fight in this game because my weapons will break in no time fighting what is the same 3 or 4 enemy types. In a Zelda game, I don't want to fight enemies. Massive and expansive world? Give me a break, everywhere you go it's shrines and korok seeds. Interesting mountains, shrines and korok seeds. Cool looking desert area? Shrines and korok seeds. Literally anything at all, shrines and korok seeds. Why would I want to do a side quest, when I know that at the end I'll unlock another shrine, I don't even want to mention the horrendous motion controls. The story is something to fall asleep to, the voice acting is, just why. Have the game fully voice acted or leave it out.

smahlt,19-04-2017,"I felt compelled to write an honest review because everything else is either ""10/10 OMG IT'S ZELDA"" or ""LOL NEVER PLAYED IT BUT 0/10"".

I've played nearly every Zelda game. It is my favorite game series, and OoT is my favorite game of all time. I generally only hate on Zelda when it has something annoying getting in the way of the fun (such as Skyward Sword's and Phantom Hourglass's controls). This game is not amazing. It is a solid open world game with no particular strengths or weaknesses (other than having a giant world with nothing in it, but that's expected at this point). The story is standard Zelda fare, the graphics are great, the music is good when it's actually playing, and the controls are solid, though the mapping takes a little getting used to.

Don't buy a Switch just for this game. Play it on your WiiU if you have one, or just wait until there's more reasons to buy a Switch.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

1.- Huge world to explore
2.- Open world with tons of possibilities.
3.- Full of options
4.- Combat is hard but you can decide how to fight them.
5.- Good art direction, Hyrule looks amazing.
6.- Music is always great when you like Zelda themes.
7.- you can cook your items, craft new stuff and as result Lynk is not always wearing the same green suit. Now you can change the armor, weapons.
Cons:

1.- Frame rate drops sometimes and is very noticeable.
2.- 30 FPS cap
3.- Difficulty is not balanced, sometimes you feel is a Dark Souls game and sometimes is very easy.
4.- Weapons broken very fast sometimes.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ANeuhouser,17-03-2017,"To give an impression of play time have completed 74/120 shrines and unlocked all of the towers.

The negatives:
- Quest and character depth are pretty minimal compared to something like The Witcher.
- Enemy variety is also lacking there are 12 enemy types (Lynel, Hinox, Molduga, Talus, Bokoblin, Moblin, Lizalfos, Wizzrobe, Chuchu, Keese, Octorock, Guardians) and they are all seen throughout the map, just recolored or with a different elemental power in different areas.
- Weapons degrade too quickly, most weapons are not durable enough to kill a single one of the tougher enemy types without breaking (White Wokoblin, Blue Moblin, Black Lizalfos, Lynel, Hinox, Molduga, Talus)
- Tougher variants of common enemies (White Wokoblin, Blue Moblin, Black Lizalfos) don't fight any differently than their weaker counterparts, they just have their damage and health cranked way up. Most of these units can be easily knocked down in a few hits but then you have to sit there breaking weapons on them for ~30s until they die.
- There are only 4 real dungeons in the game, they are all quite small, and all have the same type of puzzles.
- Too many ""____'s Blessing"" shrines that have no puzzle inside of them.
- Occasional stuttering when playing in docked mode.

The positives:
- Nostalgia, nostalgia in spades.
- It's a pretty good take on the standard ubisoft open world game. Towers unlock portions of the map but unlike a ubisoft game the towers do not then litter your map with icons. Exploration is key in finding everything.
- The exploration mechanics are great, The paraglider and climbing mechanics make traversing the map quite fun.
- There is weapon and armor variety well beyond any other LoZ game.
- Combat presents a greater challenge than other LoZ games and taking down the miniboss monsters (Lynel, Hinox, Molduga, Talus) scattered around the map is very rewarding.
- Smooth frames and no stuttering when playing in handheld mode.

Overall it's a pretty decent open world game with some shortcomings but a good amount of fun.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

multiplat_gamer,30-03-2017,"As a Zelda fan, I consider Breath of the Wild a good game but it's not as perfect as most reviewers say because:

1. Poor acting choices (Zelda)

If you decide to include a few (and just a few) voices in the game just do it right! Zelda has always been one of my favourite characters since Ocarina of Time. She was mysterious, daring and somehow cool. I'm so disappointed with her ridiculously trembling voice that no one can believe nor take seriously.

There are a few other issues with the game but Zelda's voice is something that could have been chosen right easily!

2. Frustrating climbing

It rains a lot in Breath of the Wild and whenever it rains, you can't climb. It's that simple. I was stuck on an island with no shrines around and no way to make fire but I wanted to explore it anyway. All I could do was wait a long while until I was able to climb to keep checking the island. Another good example is when you are near the top of the mountain and then it starts raining and you fall all the way down. Lovely! To make things worse, 90% of the terrain requires climbing.

3. Disappointing dungeons (including the mystical ones)

I firmly believe that they are the worst in the series. Mostly, they are superficial and gimmicky.

4. Awkward inventory system

You have to eat food to restore hearts and stamina in a pause menu which feels very awkward to do while climbing and fighting. Also, all weapons break easily so you have to hold right to open the weapons menu and select another weapon in the middle of almost every single fight, which literally breaks the action.

5. Technical issues (choppy frame rate and game freezing)

Noticeable technical issues don't make a good game bad but they are detrimental to the enjoyment of the game, period.

6. Visuals are good and bad

Some places look quite good, like the beaches and sea, while other places look not exactly pointillist but just blurry a la Skyward Sword.

7. Music (where?)

Seriously, where's the music? All you are going to hear most of the time is some short harmonies (no, it's not your phone's notifications) or background sounds. And why did they replace the old ranch music with the new and much worse one? Zora's music is still awesome but it's drowned in the water and can hardly be heard.

Conclusion

I still like the game quite much regardless of its issues but after over 80 hours I can't see why it should be considered the best Zelda game ever. Reviewers will admit this eventually, once enough time has passed by. There are a few articles daring to say so already. I think some hidden Switch marketing is the reason for many websites to crown Breath of the Wild. Nevertheless, it's a good game that is so overrated.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
CrackKat,05-03-2017,"If you love open world this will be your favourite game of all time, it truly takes the genre to the next level.
What makes a game of this ambition good? It's interactiveness. If you have a giant open world that you can only traverse, but not interact with, it's empty. This game is the opposite of that.
The climbing mechanic is fundamental, it means that you can truly explore the open world with freedom, anything you see, you can reach. But even the climbing has depth because of the stamina bar. You have to choose the least steep approach to minimise stamina drain and bring food/potions that boost stamina with you to help scale the grandest mountains.
Why is the climbing and exploring great? Because the world is incredibly interactive like no other game. You can cut down a tree and throw objects at it to reposition it using the game's physics system. Once the cut down tree is in place you can walk along it as a bridge to cross a gap or freezing body of water. This is one example of interactivity. Another is lightning, if lightning strikes the grass, it will be set on fire. If the wind is blowing strongly, that fire will spread in that direction. The hot air from the fire will rise, allowing you to ride it up with a sail cloth to reach higher areas.
All this interactiveness is fully realised through the powers you are given early in the game. The power to manipulate metal objects and the power to store, gather and unleash kinetic energy on objects helps you to creatively solve problems in the vast open world.
These gameplay mechanics are in the context of a world full of enemies who gather in base camps and lookouts, waiting for you to openly assault them, stealthily kill them or creatively use your powers and the surrounding world to crush/burn/explode them. And if you play your cards right, you can get them to kill each other with their own projectiles, that's another example of how interactive everything is, a thrown rock will hurt anyone not just the target it was thrown at.
But what happens when you defeat enemies? is the world left empty? or do they simply respawn when you look away? Fortunately it's neither. Through a mechanic I won't spoil, you will always be able to find enemies to fight in the world, they will not run out.
And the enemies are ruthless, for the first time ever in a Zelda game I find myself dying, several times. Fortunately the game auto saves frequently, putting you back to your last auto-save point on death. This is perfect as it means that you don't lose much progress, but nor are you simply respawned instantly right next to your opponents as if nothing happened.
It's two main features that define this game: interactivity and execution. More interactivity than any other open world game I've ever played, and the execution of the world design and gameplay mechanics is superb. This is all without mentioning the gorgeous graphics which for me make it the best looking game period. But I do not use this as a focus of the review as it's down to personal taste, I happen to love the art style, but some may not.
Certainly for me, Breath of the Wild is the greatest game ever made, and I'm still less than 20 hours into it, but I'm sure this is going to be one that lasts well over 100 hours, potentially 200.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
theupturnedtree,04-03-2017,"I may have been a Nintendo player all of my 23 years of life (and a Zelda romantic since my uncle first introduced me to Ocarina of Time when I was 5), I have played on almost every console and PC nearly every type of game imaginable.

This game recaptures the wonder I felt exploring OoT for the first time as a child. Now, some 18 years later and with all of my ""skills"" acquired playing video games, I feel just as daunted by the task in front of me as I did trying to figure out what to do when I got to Hyrule Field for the first time. The scope of the game is unimaginable as far as Zelda games go, and I am not sure if Nintendo has actually really captured this spirit in a game they produced in one of the main series they own, or even in the smaller franchises.

Even so, the game is HARD. It definitely feels easy once you figure out the main controls going through the first area of the game, which is a long and drawn out glorified tutorial, but when you begin looking for things that span the world (which it gives you very little direction to, by the by), you will likely die. And die. And die again.

It is impressive to play, and just as impressive to listen to and watch. It looks like a moving painting, and sounds like it has been scored with tender care. The art of the game is perfect, though I can see how some would not like the ""living painting"" style after being bombarded with photo-realism the past few years.

I would write more... but I really want to get to the first dungeon by the time I go back to work on Monday morning. I heartily suggest getting this game, if you can, and would like to experience something great.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Though it suffered from frame rate issues in the grassy/shadowy reasons such as the Great Plateau and the forest regions.This game was difficult but not on the level of the Dark Souls series. You're able to regenerate your health through food and elixirs. I also didn't care for the weapon durability. It would have been okay if it was just the swords. But the bows too? Those are my complaints. The positives greatly outweigh the negatives. Fantastic combat. Beautiful music. Immersive world. Freedom. The shrines are very intelligently designed and rely on logic. Some enemies seem to be tanks that take forever to kill but I'm used to these types of enemies. Don't know if I'd call this my favorite Zelda game. Ocarina and Major'as are still the pinnacle of the series to me. Overall, though it is one of the best games that has come out in years and definitely the front runner for Game of the Year.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DavidNar,06-03-2017,"Primero, no creo mucho en estos reviews, he leído bastantes y están llenos de trolls, tratando de bajar el perfil a este juego. Ahora bien, el juego cumple con lo prometido, es un tipo de juego ""open-air"" como le llamaron, y es verdad, puedes ir donde tú quieras, donde se te ocurra prácticamente. Las primeras horas de juego las pasé en el ya clásico paisaje del demo del E3 2016, me habré demorado un par de horas sacar los primeros poderes del sheika slate, pero me demoré por una razón: hay demasiadas cosas por ver, demasiados secretos, una vez que descubres un poder pues lo pruebas y encuentras más cosas. Ahora mismo llevo ya unas 22 horas de juego, y aún no alcanzo el primer templo, por lo mismo.

Las mecánicas del juego son agradables, lo de las armas a veces es un poco frustrante pero es parte del juego, hay que buscar armas, hay que inventar maneras para derrotar a enemigos, hay algunos que no he podido derrotar francamente.

El menú del juego es mucho más agradable que otras entregas de Zelda, no hay que esperar nada, es todo instantáneo y se comprende rápidamente.

Los controles del juego son algo difícil a que acostumbrarse, al principio, luego claro se hace mucho más fácil y es muy cómodo, resulta sorprendente la cantidad de acciones que se pueden realizar.

De la historia no he visto mucho, he encontrado algunas cosas, por aquí, por allá, tratando de resolver una cosa me topé con otra y la seguí y, pues, descubrí mucho más. La experiencia de juego resulta totalmente satisfactoria. Juego con mi novia, ella no había jugado Zelda en otra ocasión y este simplemente le fascinó, lo jugamos por muchas horas, llevamos todas esas horas de juego y aún nos queda más de la mitad por descubrir, mucho más diría yo.

Las únicas pantallas de carga son cuando se teletransporta a algún santuario u otro lugar, y cuando entras a los mismos, es la úníca pantalla de carga que se verá y vaya que pasa rápido. No me soprendería (comentario aparte) que los 100 santuarios estuviesen conectados tal como lo hicieron con TLOZ para NES, aunque bueno eso es solo imaginación mía.

La variedad de enemigos, animales, insectos, materiales, los tipos de transporte, las armas, escudos, herramientas, ropajes, paisajes hace de este juego una aunténtica joya, yo estoy más que contento y de seguro le sacaré muchas horas más. Lo único que se le puede decir a este Zelda son algunas caídas de frame, son puntuales creo yo, no hacen que la experiencia del juego se estropee.

MiawMix,17-03-2017,"Far from perfect, this game is flawed in every aspect i know. Let's take look one by one:

- Visual: Not even water color art style can hide the bad graphic performance. Low resolution 720p, sub-par 20fps and even slower in docking mode, bad texture, popping out objects, over use of bloom. Just name it.

-Musics: No memorable track, or if you're optimistic you can call it full of 'ambience'. It is ok, but for some part there's no music at all.

-The world: It's big and empty with monster settlement in between. You can count dungeon in one hand, and there're 120 'shrine'. The problem is you can finish any shrine in just 30 second. The puzzles are really simple, like just glide over 2 holes etc.

-Enemy: Most of their design are copy-paste with slight alteration, even the bosses. The most depressing part is their AI. God they're as stupid as turtle.

-Gameplay: Relies heavily on gear, not skill. The enemy AI obviously doesn't help. In high level area you can play around with them but you can't kill them, or you can try and broke your weapons.

drumbledwarf,03-03-2017,"Do not believe the minority of ""0"" negative user reviews on Metacritic that are made by people who haven't played the game but for some erroneous reason have a vendetta against a series like Zelda living up to its pedigree. I've played this game for hours and it has stoked and maintained a giddiness and nostalgia that I haven't felt since childhood. The myriad of possibilities and tendency to find yourself completely lost are just two of the ways that Breath of the Wild helps you realise your identity as what the series has always wanted you be, a courageous explorer.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
syedbdusa,03-03-2017,This game is visually stunning and the soundtrack greatly adds to the experience. I've never been much of Zelda fan but I've never been as excited about a game as this one. The flow is perfect and the possibilities are endless.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Inzaine,03-03-2017,"An absolute convention-defier. The latest installment of the Zelda franchis does NOT dissapoint. With unlimited bounds, you can explore every inch of Hyrule. No corner is without something to do. All characters are charming, with something unique to say, whether they're fearful of the moblins or selling some stuff.

The combat never gets repetitive. Taking down a horde of enemies is SO satisfying. Whether you sneak up, launch a guns-ablazing attack or snip at them with the arrows, you always get something. The abilities such as being able to lift metal, create ice blocks from water, throwing bombs or stopping the flow of time, they are ALL unique.

The story is compelling and creative. Character developement is done through meaningful flashbacks. No character is bland.

Get the game.

Draygoon,03-03-2017,Best zelda game i've ever played. brings me back to the ocarina of time days. the open exploration that you get in the game is like none other. the world map is huge gameplay is fun and exciting. the amount of weapons seems endless.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Corgiwan,03-03-2017,"This game isn't perfect. I'm giving it a 10 because I have to round up my 9.8 score for it. This game is pretty damn near perfect, and I'm sure it will get GOTY. The ONLY downside for it is that there are points in the game where there is a frame rate drop.

Being a PC gamer myself, I notice these drops more often than those who are not used to the crisp 60 fps that PC can give. However, I quickly got over it and adjusted. Whats more, if you simply can't bear it you can just switch to handheld mode and the frame drops are gone.

If you liked Ocarina, then you'll love this. If Ocarina is your favorite Zelda game, then this will probably dethrone it. There's so much to do in this game, and its so well executed that you just get lost in the world for hours upon hours.

It's unfortunate that there's so many salty people that have their jimmies all rustled up because the critic reviews are damn near perfect. These people are just going to try and give as many super low scores as possible even though they don't even own the game. This game deserves the high scores it is receiving, and no salty kids are going to stop it from getting GOTY, and all with what they consider **** graphics.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I'm not into this open world games but I'll try my best to explore this vast world Nintendo is giving us in this adventure, WiiU or Switch the game looks magnificent (Switch gets better resolution and less frame drop)
Frame drop is a thing in the game but it will be minor, and btw those ugly troll comments...you cant deny that all this open world games DO run on less than 60FPS, by the end of the day it's not the FPS, the graphics, and/or power, but what you felt with the game, the story, music and mostly how you enjoyed the game.

Happy gaming! I usually dont rate stuff but this game is getting that troll hate so I wanted to balance this, game is not perfect, I have NEVER seen a perfect game in my life, they all have an issue, heavy bugs, horrible controls, no music, bland story....but until now (7 hours of gameplay) I can say Im happy with my purchase!

I've watched about 18 hours of this game on twitch and in my eyes its a masterpiece.
Its a true Open-World Zelda with a beautiful Design and nice Quests and Puzzles.
The only thing I dislike is the durability, which means Weapons are short-lived.
Durability is fine, but things degrade too fast and there is no way to repair or strengthen the durability of a weapon.

Camitic,04-04-2017,"I am a huge Zelda fan make no mistake and Breath Of The Wild isn't a bad game but its not the best Zelda game either.
The open world at first blew my mind i thought wow.........but after the alluring shine reality sunk in and I began to dislike certain aspects of the game.

The weapon durability system is the biggest one and I wasn't quite sure what the aim was with that.I became increasing annoyed at having to change weapons mid-fight. The stamina wheel which made sense with climbing annoyed me when sprinting. The shrines......I get needing to make a system to upgrade our hearts/stamina but the shrines felt more of an annoyance then a challenge to overcome.

However the story is fantastic. The climbing aspect is great I loved and with the rain causing climbing to be an issue it added a lovely dynamic to the game. The physics of the game overall are quite brilliant and work well in a open world game.

Overall a good solid Zelda game that attempted to break from certain traditions which I respect.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
RealMido,05-03-2017,"What sets the open world of this game is that you look at horizon you will see a landmark so you can play without the mini-map. the climbing on every surface is very useful to explore the world. Game mechanics all open up in the first area in the game, so you can explore at your own pace. The game tends to reward you for exploration and at the same time I never felt overwhelmed by how large the world is. Must play for fans and a lovely introduction for first timers.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dopehat,07-03-2017,"As a big fan of the Zelda series, I really like what they did with this game. Sure they could have stuck with the classic liniear gameplay with 12 dungeons or so, but this feels new - and so far enjoying it. I've spend roughly 30 hours so far, and barely done much with the main story.
I've seen people crying about the FPS drops and honestly, they aren't bad at all.. It happens when alot of stuff is happening all at once and only last for about 2-3 seconds. I think i've experienced 5 or 6 framedrops so far - so honestly it doesn't really bother me at all, and does not effect gameplay much.

As for the other crying scrubs in the negative section, most of them seems to have given up on the game after less than 2 hours and have absolutely no clue what they are talking about.
Thank you Nintendo for this gem, I was worried you wouldn't deliever a good game, but it seems you exceed my expectations.

Only downside is ... I miss Midna from TP...",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Vamphaery,05-03-2017,"Taking off my very heavily rose tinted Zelda fandom glasses and trying to describe the game simply for what it is, I'll say it's an open world action RPG with simple but profoundly satisfying mechanics, a heavy emphasis on exploration and discovery, and some of the most brilliant and *satisfying* physics and logic puzzles I've ever seen in a game. (Any game. Honestly, it gives the Portal series and others a very strong run for their money in terms of trying to figure out what to do, and then making use of the game's myriad abilities and its physics engine and timing to solve certain areas.)

Some caveats, of course. If you've never enjoyed past Zelda games because of the simplistic story, silliness/humor, or general themes, this game isn't likely to change your mind. It does give the world and its history a much greater sense of lore than past installments, and there is voice acting in cut scenes now, but this is still a Zelda game. It still feels like Zelda, it still looks like Zelda, NPCs are still silly/humorous at times like Zelda, most dialogue is still text-based, and mechanically, despite a great many additions that transform the way you play and explore (for the better by far imho,) it still feels - largely, at least - like Zelda.

Where it differs, and where its genius lies, is both in its constant sense of challenge, and the total freedom it provides to choose how best to overcome its many obstacles. While the save system is extremely generous so as to avoid tedium, even well into the game with lots of health and stamina increases under your belt, you'll encounter enemies that can easily one-hit annihilate you. And every time you acclimate to an enemy or an area and its particular challenges, the game throws something new at you.

You'll spend a lot of time moving the camera around to get a good view of where you're trying to go, and then trying to decide where to climb/jump/glide so as to reach your intended goal (this free form ability to pick a destination and then try to formulate a tactic for reaching it is one of the game's strengths - maybe its greatest imo) without running out of stamina - which means falling.

There is *something* to be found everywhere you climb or explore. Shrines (which contain the aforementioned puzzles,) NPCs, Koroks, overworld mini-bosses, enemy forts, or simply chests containing money, ammunition, weapons, armor, or other goodies (sometimes even rare weapons,) abound. But there are still occasional areas that are devoid of any major world content. This lends the game a slow, methodical, lonely feeling at times. (Though some would instead call it boring. Pick your adjective depending upon personal taste. I love it.)

The physics engine in the game means you can push boulders down hills into enemies, set fires (which spread) to create updrafts to lift your paraglider higher into the air, chop down trees and send them floating down rivers to create makeshift bridges, freeze water to create pillars that alter the path of moving objects in creative ways, or build ad hoc catapults. And much more. Experimenting is rewarding.

It's going to be very difficult for me to go back to only being able to ride/walk/drive/jump everywhere in games like GTA, Bethesda's titles, or Red Dead, unless they include some form of climbing. The sense of real freedom - and thoughtful effort - it imparts is just too profound to ever go without again imo. And that challenge (can I get up here or should I try another side of the cliff that might be easier? And if I do, will I fall and lose my opportunity to get up there? Do I need stamina elixirs first? Where's the nearest fire to make them?) is the best part of the game for me.

The first two shrines I did were already the most satisfying puzzles I've ever completed in a game, despite their brevity... and that's just the tip of the ice berg. The game's design and mechanics are, frankly, ingeniously implemented. Perhaps best of all, challenge level seems commensurate with payoff (abilities, powerful items, etc.) which is great. Discovery always leads to some degree of advancement.

What Ocarina of Time did for Zelda and games in general for its time, with the huge shock and awe of seeing the 2D to 3D transition still in full effect, Breath of the Wild likewise does in its own time for design and freedom... without having to rely on that sense of awe that the industry transitioning to 3D gave us. It doesn't surpass it, but for me, it DOES equal it. (Which in and of itself is astounding.)

The game is a high 9 for me rather than a 10. There are some muddy textures, some aliasing, and some frame rate issues. Those are the only technical blemishes I've encountered, and that seems to be the consensus so far.

In short, it's just plain fun, and beautifully implemented. But as with all games, it won't be for everyone. Use the above information to formulate where you're likely to fall. The quantity and variety of content is vast.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SJile,08-03-2017,"This is far and away the best Zelda game to date, and will be remembered as one of the greatest games ever made. It's almost too good to be true--but over 40 hours in, it's still really that good.

It takes the groundbreaking innovation of the very first Zelda game and Ocarina of Time, and basically asks: what did people love about these games? What do people love about games in general?

I really can't articulate well enough how much of a treasure this game truly is. The Switch has received some criticism for not having a more robust launch line up, but the fact of the matter is that Zelda: BOTW is a Game of the Year title and is pure gold for the launch of a new system. Yeah, yeah, the PS4 and Xbox One both had dozens of games available out the door, however do you still own any of them? I guarantee that every person who purchased a Switch at launch (or is about to) will still have Zelda years down the road. Beautiful graphics, music, gameplay and story and best of all, it was all stitched together with the love that Nintendo pours into it's games. This is really feels more like the sequel to Ocarina of Time that we had been hoping for, for such a long time. Do yourself a favor and buy this now.

Breath of the Wild is an example of Nintendo trying to cash in on the success of Skyrim and Dark Souls, but they handle it all wrong. What's weird is that Skyrim is mainly caves to explore, yet I e
njoy that. BotW is the same now with the shrines, but some take very little time to complete, but I don't enjoy it. Mainly, because I play Zelda for the Zelda mechanics, but honestly...There are none. Well, none may be harsh, but there is a huge lack of the ""Zelda formula"". You get all the abilities right at the start and weapons, you just pick up along the way. Everything is accessible form the start, which means you can't use tools like the hookshot to reach new places later in the game ""Yes, there is no hookshot...Or any other tools the past Zelda games have).

Some of the battles can be very unbalanced against your favour, but then combat as a whole (excluding mandatory battles like boss battles) can just be avoided. There's really no need to fight anything in this game. The game offers a stealth mechanic, and this is seems to be broken too as enemies just know where you are. Buffs never seem to give you much of a boost.

And if you really want to spoil a game, add a stamina gauge!. Dark Souls uses a stamina gauge, but it's far less hindering than the one in this game. Why? Because Nintendo decided what uses your stamina in a stupid way. Swimming up a waterfall doesn't deplete your stamina, yet swimming normally in a small pond does?

And another take on Dark Souls, is that the lore is scattered around. Not in items, but in randomly placed books around Hyrule.

The ""dungeons"" if you want to call them that are more puzzle based, very short with no rewarding items.

I get Nintendo wants to evolve the series, which I'm open to. I'm not saying it's a massively bad game, but it needs work. A lot of work. It could still be a Metroidvania and still play as BotW. But the focus need to be more on dungeon exploring and combat. In truth, I haven't even mentioned all the gripes I have with this game.

SimplexSimon,04-03-2017,"This game is perfect. There is so much nintendo charm. The world is huge and it is filled with interesting secrets and mystery. The combat feels great and cooking really adds another layer to the game. If you have a wii u or switch this is a must buy. If you don't have either, I'd highly recommend you buy a switch. This games is by far the best game to come out in the last 15 years.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kennebec,03-03-2017,"Probably the best zelda game ever. The best open world game I have ever played, it's nice that you have to explore on your own, and not have a map full of icons (farcry 4) to guide you. It truly is a create your own adventure.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DRTDR,04-03-2017,"Lots of trolls here spreading lies and overall childish statements, have no fear and make no mistakes this is at the very least the best Zelda to date, its massive world its never dull and you'll be discovering new vistas and things to do well after the 70 hour mark, yet it doesn't force you to take all that time to finish it nor does it ""end"" your adventure once the story is over.
This is a tough Zelda game, specially compared to the past few entries in the series, you'll die a lot.
Graphics are good, nothing too fancy since it began its life as a wii u game but the cell shading style and vibrant colors make up for that, trust me, you'll find stunning sights to behold in the world and great character design in its inhabitants. (Funny how some trolling children that never touched a ps2 call cell shading ""ps2 graffix!!"").
Frame rate drops? Occasionally, in select areas of the massive world and never enough to get you out of the experience, in fact I wouldn't even address them since they are minor but I have to because of the frame rate ""scare"" and trolls, a minor thing never the less, maybe on a smaller scale world it would be a point against it but not here, at all. This game is as big as you thought it would be, the story telling reminds me of Skyward sword and everything else is full of wonder an discovery, 10 out of 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
iamevilhomer,03-03-2017,"I never give perfect 10's. That being said this game is about a 9.7 or 9.8 lol. It really is. I haven't even played it yet to be honest so don't take my review seriously. I have however seen plenty of reviews and seen lots of game play. Enough to say that well... It's been a long time since a console launched with a game that rivals the likes of halo ce, metroid prime, chrono trigger, and ocarina of time. A game like this goes down in history as a time less classic.

So call me names for giving a score to a game I haven't played yet but hey... I been a gamer for almost 30 years and my instincts and research prove that this game is great and will probably win game of the year.

I will admit that playing the game would give me a more in depth idea of the games quality but hey... Research and gameplay videos give you a good enough idea... A good enough idea to know if the game is bad, mediocre, good, or great and clearly this one is great.

So you can hate on me for scoring the game high without even playing it but please don't. Not when there are xbox, pc, and playstation fans giving it 0/10 scores. Those are the real unreasonable jerks. I'm a ps2 fan and don't care for the ps3 and ps4 but you don't see me bashing last of us... I know last of us is a great game...

It just saddens me to see that fanboys can rage so hard and bash something so hard just because the reviews are good and that nintendo isn't all about multiplayer online only trash like over watch and cod. Multiplayer online gaming is pretty much dead anyways. Lag, cheaters, betrayers, trollers, gankers, unbalanced crap, nube friendly games, extra expenses, micro transactions etc etc... Games like Botw don't have anything to do with that crap and deliver what gamers truly need and want deep down. A fun single player game that you will remember forever.

So like I said... Don't take this review too seriously. Hell... don't take any review seriously lol. But please ignore the red scores on this site. They are clearly just trying to make nintendo look bad because they have some sort of blind hatred for nintendo which is stupid because nintendo has screwed over gamers financially far less than pc, playstation, and xbox. Morons...

Glad to see a console launch with a must have game. Nintendo hasn't done this since the N64 with Super mario 64. Glad to see it at 98% from the critic reviews. Games like Witcher 3, Doom, Blood born, and this don't screw the customer over with micro transactions. You wont see buying hearts for 5 dollars a piece in this game lol. More games like this need to exist and less games like over watch. I know over watch can be fun but it does so much to poop on the customer in exchange. Botw on the other hand does next to nothing to mess with the customer financially and offers a experience you wont get anywhere... Especially not in a generic online shooter.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Osodrak64,04-03-2017,"I already finished the game and all I can say is: BEST GAME EVER!! Nintendo really worked hard and put so much effort on making this game just like it is, I'm truly in love with it and after 15 years of gaming this is definitely the best game I've ever played. It deserves being played by all gamers and I'm so lucky to be able to have this game in my hands and I will embrace it forever! This isn't a regular game, this is ART! ""If you can see it, you can get it."" I can't remember who said that but It is true, the way you can do whatever you want and interact with so many things in so many different ways fill up the gigant world that you live in. The story is amazing, the gameplay even better and the most important thing to me: It's very fun and entertaining. I recommend Breath of the Wild for all players across the world and I hope that Nintendo will make a lot of money with it because they deserve it, believe me, they really deserve everything!

I may one review under my name and it a average review for Horizon Zero Dawn but I didn't write that review as fanboy of Nintendo or Microsoft. I wrote it as a gamer who has been playing games for the last 15 years. I think this game is worthy of a ten because it gives me the freedom to let me do whatever I want to do in the first hour or two and that freedom lets me try many different things. Yes the game is not the best looking game out there and there is the frame rate drop every once in a while but everything else the game does makes me not worry about those and just lets me enjoy the freedom it gets me.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Dadrik,04-03-2017,"While this game will be divisive among fans of the franchise, there's no doubt that it's a masterpiece.
First, the freedom is almost total, you're free to go everywhere you want to go, minus some specific places. You see a ledge ? A wall ? You can climb it. No barrier.
While the story and musics are kinda standing back compared to the previous entries, they're still good, and the focus on exploration is absolutely fantastic. This is the ultimate adventure game.

There are some performance issues, and the bestiary is rather lacking, but these are really minor flaws, compared to what the game offers.

Yes, TLoZ has changed with Breath of the Wild. But Nintendo took a worthy risk and delivered one of the best games of the past 10 years. Truely a new standard.

If you were on the fence, I really recommend it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Juicetin,03-03-2017,"Personally I've always struggled to be gripped by the Zelda games (despite their massive success). However Breath of the Wild has managed to grip me within the first few hours of gameplay.

I see this game setting an example for future developers on how an RPG should be done! 10/10, wood bang.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
felipe_ebf,03-03-2017,"Hey Nintendo haters, and fanboys of PS, you can put how many 0/10 you want in the review, but your review will not change the fact that this game, The Legend Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild is one of the best games ever created. I Know it is painful to accept that this game is better than anything that you favorite developer of games ever created or will create someday, but this is it, Breath Of The Wild is better than The Witcher 3, Horizon Zero Dawn, The Last Guardian, Uncharted 4 or any other uncharted, the last of us, and is more sad that the last of us 2, red dead redemption 2, god of war will not be better than this games.

When Nintendo decide to make a masterpiece, they simply does, and this games is only one more masterpiece of Nintendo. The best game ever created is The Legend of Zelda Ocarina Of Time with 99/100, and now The Legend Of Zelda Breath of The Wild is the second one, cry more, your tears is salty and delicious.

Put more negative review on the user reviews, maybe the universe will be in equilibrium again.

MASTERPIECE, one of the best games ever created, probably will be GOTY 2017 and will be the best game of this generetion, just like MARIO GALAXY WAS THE BEST GAME OF THE LAST GENERATION.

GamerJosh0137,04-03-2017,"Wow, just wow. I don't have the words honestly. I have not owned a Nintendo console since the Gamecube. Not out of specific dislikes for Nintendo but at the time I never could justify spending money on multiple consoles and PlayStation was more in line with what I love to play. That being said I am now able to afford more than one console and the Switch was the perfect buy, because it allows me to play Zelda: Breath of the Wild. It is insanely good, and a perfect game to start after finishing Horizon Zero Dawn. Zelda is gorgeous and quite frankly proves that more powerful hardware doesn't equal better games. Combat is fluid and super fun. The damaged weapon mechanic forces you to ""Switch"" up (see what I did there? ha!) gameplay style and manages to keep it relatively fresh. Zelda is also a LOT harder than I expected. Not so much on the level of Dark Souls or anything but enough to take me by surprise. I honestly cannot think of one thing I really don't like about Zelda. I was really worried because I was basically buying the Switch to play Zelda and ALMOST bought the Wii U instead due to it being much cheaper, but after using the Switch I'm super excited for what will come, and if there are several games HALF as good as Zelda I will be super happy.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

If this game had received a score of 92 by critics, Nintendo haters wouldn't have been so pissed of and less of them would've taken the time to review the game with a zero. But if you check at the negative 0, 1 and 2 reviews, (because either they vote with a 0 or they don't vote at all) everyone of them says the same: ""This game looks like PS2, my PS4Pro is much better"", and you can perfectly see what else they mean with that: ""Horizon Zero Dawn is 1000 times better than this, all hail Sony"". **** ridiculou.

TLDR: We live in a world where MGSV has a 93 and HorizonZD a 88, if we see that you need an average of these two games to get a 9/10, Zelda would be about a 13/10.
Zelda IS NOT A PERFECT GAME, but keeping in mind how little you gotta do to get a 9, Zelda is indeed a 10 and deserves every single one of those scores. And **** you all Nintendo haters.

dharma,10-06-2017,"The long awaited installment to the Zelda franchise is one of the best game in recent memory. Nintendo has done it again, reinventing a 'typical modern' genre, this time the 'Open World' adventures popularized by Skyrim, and retooling it to suit its biggest franchise yet. The end result is a mesmerizing and immersive experience that is unparalled. This coupled with the new Nintendo Switch allows players to literally play this game non stop, taking it everywhere you go. As an (slightly) older gamer myself, time and place is one of the few impediments to enjoy a AAA experience. You just can't sit down in front of the TV all the time. The Nintendo Switch blurs this, and Zelda is rightfully the 'killer app' that allows you to do that. Without the baggage of being a launch game for a new hardware, BOTW is simply stunning in its ability to create a truly continuous and interactive world. Every surface, every mountain can be climbed. Did you see those scenery way beyond the horizon? Yup, you can go there to. Do you want to kill the threatening Guardian, a mini boss, with just a shovel or even with a chicken? Yes, you can do that as well. It's this free form gameplay that spawns hundreds of Youtube videos. When the end credit rolls, you'll discover that there are many things to do and collect, that you will literally keep on playing.

Well on the switch only 3 hours on the go is the only downside and it's not entirely the fault on the game mostly is the fault of the hardware lol. I almost lost myself in about nearly 35 hours (have 13 hearts, 3 of the 4 beasts beated, the master sword, etc) this game has a few frame drops and some minor weird textured walls on some shrine temples. Beside that non issue almost unnoticeable little details, the game is almost perfect. Hopefully Nintendo will address the frame drop issue on time before or on time with the first content of the expansion pass.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
shundog,10-04-2017,"The princess has no clothes! There, I said it. A good game, but not great, and nowhere near perfect.

Before I get into the negatives, I will mention one positive: the art. The art in this game is truly amazing. It's unique and refreshing in a time where most games strive too look as realistic possible. I had mixed feelings about it when I saw it in trailers, but after playing the game, I absolutely adore it.

The landscapes are also impressive. They are enormous and well designed. However, I can’t help but feel that they are over-done. A lot of the world, while beautiful, feels rather empty. I think that the open world concept works very well, but the world itself could have easily been 1/2 to 1/3 of the size. There world is seriously HUGE -- it's bigger than that of most MMOs. A lot of the areas don't even have dungeons, which makes me wonder what purpose they serve.

My biggest complaint about this game is the weapon durability system. I think it is a decent idea, but one that is poorly implemented. It’s kind of hilarious to complete a dungeon and be rewarded with a weapon that breaks after a few swings… like thanks, I guess? It makes finding epic weapons feel like crap. I also find it laughable that bows have such low durability when you already have ammo to deal with. As if ammo wasn’t tedious enough! There needs to be more unbreakable weapons and the durability on breakable weapons needs to be increased by at least 10x.

As for the shrines, the vast majority of them are way too easy or short. Heart pieces were better.

Dungeons are in the same boat as shrines. There are only a handful and they are extremely easy, especially when compared to the dungeons in the previous titles. They are all very short, contain few enemies, have the same aesthetic, and rely on the same gimmicky rubrics-cube-map mechanic to complete (which I did not find challenging at all). Also, the bosses are pathetic -- I beat most of them in 1 shot, some without even taking damage. Dark Souls it is not. Overall, the dungeons in this game are a HUGE letdown. The Great Deku Tree in OOT feels epic in comparison to some of them (ok, maybe a slight exaggeration, but still). They feel like an afterthought. In past Zelda games, dungeons have always been the focus with the overworld being just a means to get you from one dungeon to the next, but in this game, it is the opposite -- the overworld is the primary focus and the dungeons are just... there?

The inventory and cooking systems are also atrocious. I could go into great detail about why they are so bad, but I’d rather not waste my time.

So all in all, it’s enjoyable, but I don’t understand all of the 10/10s. I think most of them are fueled by nostalgia and the hardware its running on (the Switch really is a great console). It's funny that most of the 10/10 reviews will list off several negative things about the game, but still give it a 10/10. I also find the difference between the user score and crictic score to be very suspect... Ultimately, it looks like Zelda, brings back some fond memories, but at the end of the day, feels more like a cheap thrill than the real thing. It’s a good game on it's own, but it's standing on the shoulders of giants and in comparison, looks rather insignificant. Definitely the worst 3D Zelda game to date.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ricklongo,19-06-2017,"It's commonplace nowadays to refer to The Legend of Zelda as formulaic, but the franchise is no stranger to sweeping change. From Ocarina of Time's 3D revolution to the touch-based DS experiments, Nintendo's flagship adventure series has tried quite a few new directions, with varying levels of success. None of those experiments, however, were as comprehensive as Breath of the Wild. And none of them were ultimately as fantastic.

This sense of newness is made clear from the beginning, in which the player gets immediately cast as a long-slumbering Link, without any sort of exposition. The character has no memory, and only wakes up from his ressurection chamber following a mysterious voice echoing in his head.

The first moments of the game are spent exploring the Great Plateau, a location in central Hyrule that serves as an introduction to the game's main mechanics. However, after you're able to exit the Plateau thanks to your paraglider and tablet-like sheikah slate, you can go anywhere you please, including straight to the ruins of Hyrule Castle, where Calamity Ganon, the entitity who brought the world to ruin 100 years ago, waits. For a series that has become heavy on hand-holding, things are off to a great start.

The astounding level of freedom given to the player is only possible thanks to Link's game-changing ability to climb almost any surface. Previous Zelda titles would separate areas of the game by throwing unpassable mountains between them; here, each mountain is simply a new invitation to explore. The full-fledged physics engine, meanwhile, makes traversing each area even more addictive, as things just click together in a very organic way.

As someone who loves seamless exploration, I can get frustrated by intrusive story-heavy sections, all-too-common in releases nowadays. Breath of the Wild eschews this approach in a genius way: Link is soon able to recover several pictures in his sheikah slate, apparantly taken by Princess Zelda before the calamity. By finding the spots in those pictures, he can recover his memory piece by piece. This makes the story essentially a collectible, to be experienced according to the player's investigation skills, and one of the many reasons to thoroughly explore the world.

The game's Hyrule is a character unto itself: a post-apocaliptic world with signs of war and destruction at every corner, but which manages to also be extremely inviting in its pastoral beauty. Scattered over 15 seamlessly-connected, sprawling regions are plenty of ruins, but also towns, stables, landmarks, quirky characters, enemy camps, and (of course) a large number of secrets to uncover. Curiosity is always rewarded, sometimes with weapons or smaller collectibles, sometimes with large boss-like enemies or shrines.

Oh yeah, the shrines. You see, one of the longest-running Zelda traditions are its dungeons. You'd get to them (usually in linear order), solve their puzzles, collect treasure (including the special items needed to complete them), and beat the boss at the end.

Breath of the Wild, however, completely reimagines how this works. There are 120 shrines to find, and those are like bite-sized dungeons with puzzles and treasure chests. At the end of each of them, you get a spirit orb, needed to permanently increase energy and stamina. I'm of the mind that some Zelda titles can overdo dungeons, making them interminable sections of puzzle after puzzle in which I'm unable to even save and continue from where I stopped; for that reason, this new approach was a huge breath of fresh air. It also helps that the puzzles here are modular: many of them have several possible solutions, depending on how creative you want to get.

Of course, dungeons had an imponence that smaller shrines just can't match. This is where the actual stand-in for dungeons come into play. There are four of them, and they are probably the most epic thing I've seen in any Zelda game, ever. They have some key differences from traditional dungeons in how they work: each is one giant puzzle you need to solve progressively, and the ingenuity of their interconnected designs made me feel like an engineer at times for mastering them.

Speaking of story, this is a series-best. The melancholy of a devastated Hyrule can make each memory you recover extremely bittersweet, as you meet the champions that were supposed to fight the calamity, each with their own particular relationship with Link, and delve into the most well-developed Princess Zelda character we've ever been graced with.

it's weird to admit it, but Breath of the Wild single-handedly makes the entire catalogue of previous 3D Zelda games somewhat obsolete. Going back to the old approach would mean abandoning the extreme sense of freedom that pushes this game so much above everything else that's out right now. Either under the lens of the Zelda series, the open world genre, or gaming as an art form, Breath of the Wild is nothing short of a masterpiece.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AhmadAlsumain,07-03-2017,"It is such a tragic to see this absolute masterpiece game getting bad reviews for no reason other than being a great exclusive Nintendo game. Negative reviews are full of trolls. I don't understand why there are those people who just can't be happy for one another to have great exclusive games. Having said all of that, I thought that I really need to say this out loud because it would hurt some sales for such a massive game.

I want to say first *for me at least* this game has no similarities to other great Western RPG games other than it has a massive open world. That's it. Nothing more. This game has a *very* unique identity from great games like Skyrim and The Witcher. I played both games. I kinda liked them, but they are not the type of games that I would consider a masterpiece.

I think The Witcher full texts and side stories, which made it very popular to other people, but I found the amount of script is just way too much. I am more interested in gameplay and puzzles. I love the sense of freedom that The Witcher gave me, but that was it to me. And I stopped within 20 hours or less.

Now, this is a review about Zelda, not The Witcher. So let's dive into what makes Zelda such a masterpiece game.

First, it is a fun wide open world game that brings you back to the true sense of adventurers. It is simply fun to do anything you want in any way you like... Whether you choose to walk, ride the horse, or use the glider as a mean of transportation, every single method is fun in its own way.

Dungeons are so much fun. I looooove the the temples that are scattered all over Hyrule. They are full of smart puzzles to solve. They are not too difficult and not too easy. Just the right amount of difficult that makes the adventure enjoyable and challenging that won't bore you to death.

I can talk about the game in much more details, but I don't want to spoil it for you. You have to experience it to yourself. Just know that the game is perfect in every possible way.
✔️ Perfect gameplay mechanic.
✔️ Perfect Open world.
✔️ Perfect soundtrack.

And much, much more.

The game will go to be one of the greatest game of all time. Needless to say, I love this game with so much passion. I played all of Zelda games, and this one is now officially my #1",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This game captures the wonder and awe that I first experienced playing huge games like World of Warcraft, but in a mobile format! The world is vast and engaging, but not overwhelming. There are corners of the world that can feel secluded. Literally everything you can see with your eyes, you can travel to. I can spend hours just walking around aimlessly, not moving towards any specific goal, but just experiencing the world and fully enjoying myself. If you have not tried this game, please do so.

I seriously can't understand why people are rating this so low (Are that desperate because the Xbone doesn't get any good exclusives any more?).

rushiosan,26-07-2017,"A beautifully crafted world, with engaging combat and lots of small details, hurt by lack of substance where previous installments succeeded. Breath of the Wild often feels too big or too ambitious for its own good. Some important aspects were left aside in favor of picturing a vast, lively Hyrule, and while they undoubtedly achieved that, this Zelda entry felt lackluster at times - boss fights, enemy variety, story, dungeons, music. Although all of these aspects have memorable moments in the 50h main quest, they never reach the quality level of its predecessors.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
garyc,16-04-2017,"A fairly competent and interesting open world game with a focus on melee combat instead of weapons combined with a bunch of irritating gameplay mechanics.
I've heard this called the best game ever and I have seen all the 10/10 scores and I can say now these people must have been blinded by it being a Zelda game or a Nintendo game or the first game they got to try on their Switch. It's not a bad game at all it's perfectly playable but all I can think when playing it is how much people seem to have overrated it.

The open world is fine, there is a lot to see, lots of nice locations to go to, there are shrines to do which are like puzzle rooms, there are potions to cook and quests to do and there are enemy camps with loot in them. It's got all the good and bad things you get with any Nintendo game - lots of nice little touches here and there and well polished along with the bad stuff like crappy basic story, unskippable dialogue, annoying short cut scenes for every minor interaction like pressing a button and a very childish presentation etc.

If you take away all the polish and the attention to detail then this would quickly be reduced to a mediocre example of an open world game. The inventory management is bad, weapons break after a few uses so you end up with good weapons you don't really use and spend most of the game switching in between various standard weapons, meter watching ruins the fun and most of the loot is simply boring.

But the Nintendo polish is there, clearly aspects of this game have been thought through a step above than what many others would have done. This does not lift the game to greatness, but it does lift it out of mediocrity.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Lucius_13,22-03-2017,"Gotta admit after playing Skyward Sword and absolutely hating it I found I really enjoyed this Zelda game, the Open World is breathtaking, The Map is Massive so getting lost is easy, combat is really simple although the weapons exploding quickly bugged me, as of writing this review I'm just half-way through the game, some of the Shrines are challenging especially the ones where you have to move the controller around.

I absolutely love all the easter eggs towards past Zelda titles like the very first game in the series when you find an old man who bears great resemblance to the Old Guy who gives you the Wooden Sword in the first game and later on you find the Master Sword is in The Lost Woods just like in A Link To The Past.

The Voice Acting could be better especially Princess Zelda's voice I didn't know she was British lol but that's just a tiny detail I turned a blind eye to. Graphics are amazing and I don't generally judge a game based on its graphics as I believe in gameplay more than graphics but its beautiful. The Game does have slight lag issues but as said there just slight and you hardly notice them if you aren't very observant.

all in all I think this is one of the best Zelda Games of all time right behind Ocarina of Time I think it deserves a nod for Game of the Year and It definitely deserves all the 10s It got from reviewers and I don't normally agree with reviewers especially IGN they lost all credibility when they gave Street Fighter V a 8 out of 10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

There is no real story, no major dungeons, and the weapon durability is awful. Getting better gear is almost a slap in the face as you know it will break sooner than later. Why there is no repair mechanic in this game is a baffling design choice. How this game gets a pass for bad mechanics is amazing. This is the most UN-Zelda, Zelda game ever and surpasses Skyward Sword for worst in the series. The game is beautiful and exploring is fun though, I do enjoy just heading off and seeing what I can find. I would have enjoyed this more if it were a new IP, im convinced this game started life as something new and someone at. Nintendo demanded it changed. It is 7.5-8 tops.

Dibaryon,19-06-2017,"There's no such thing as a perfect game. 10/10 for me means that if you are a gamer then you have to make space in your schedule to play this game. Either buy a used WII U if you're on a budget, or do buy a Switch because it's well worth the cash they ask for it.

I've never played a Zelda game before and this is one my favourite games of all time. Other titles IMO would be: TESV:Skyrim, Half Life series, Unreal Tournament, GTA series, Age of Empires, Pokemon, Mass Effect trilogy, Max Payne 2, Colin Mcrae 2, Doom, Super Mario World, Portal 1 and 2, Tomb Raider series. BOTW deserves a spot on this list. None of them were perfect, some were ahead of their time, others were simply well designed and fun to play, or unique, but all of them are ""must plays"".

I'm a PC gamer and I have been one for about 15 years. The last console I've owned was the SNES.
The switch is the perfect console to complement PC gaming, as it's portable and will support famous titles that can't be played on PC. BOTW was a great comeback to console gaming, and I'm looking forward to the SWITCH's future.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Playing this game reinvigorated a part of me I haven't felt in years. The world is so beautiful filled with the magic Nintendo provides in all their main titles. The story is light in some aspects, but you really get involved with side missions and shrine quests which spreads out the length considerably. The world reminds me of a beautiful painting, and I can definitively say right now that this is one of my favorite games Ive ever played, and it is definitely my favorite Zelda game by far.

Main quests, side quests, freedom to do whatever, whenever you want. There are no limitations. They went all out with this and they are going to have an extremely hard time ever matching such an experience in another Zelda game. I can't see them ever going back to a Zelda game that isn't open-world. The combat is fun too, the bows, swords, elemental effects, man. There is just so much **** that is good about this game.

Honestly, too many to list, just buy this.

DaNnyDark0,07-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a pure crystallization of everything great about The Legend of Zelda series while simultaneously turning the established conventions and tropes of the franchise on it's head. It was a gamble and a risk for sure, but it is with gleeful delight and admittedly a few stray tears in my eye that this has not only paid off and then some this could very well be a new benchmark not just for the series but for open world games in general for years to come. It is a masterclass of open-world design, offering unparalleled freedom not just in how you explore this vast, meticulously crafted world but in how you engage in combat scenarios, complete quests, character growth and in many, many of it's dynamic gameplay systems.

The kingdom of Hyrule has never looked so good, from it's sweeping, emerald fields, far-flung forests, vast, treacherous tundras, sun-baked swathes of boundless deserts to it's mighty mountain ranges. It's a world bursting with life and character, and it begs you to plunder it's riches and treasures, uncover it's mysteries and secrets and you do all this at your own pace and in any way you choose. After you leave the Great Plateau, which serves as an introductory area to grapple with it's many systems, the world before you is completely open and seamless. Now I may be making a big deal of it here, as this is a trait many other open world games share but the way in which it presents this world is wholly unique to both the series and to games in general. You CAN scale that towering cliff face (providing you have enough stamina) you CAN exploit the dynamic environment to your advantage. I've never played a game that puts many restrictions on the player (i.e breakable weapons, depleting stamina gauge, environmental hazards) while at the same time giving you immense freedom back. It's a balancing act that is masterfully done and never once did it negatively impact my experience in any way, you feel both liberated and challenged at the same time.

You can of course loosen these shackles by simply progressing through the game, extending your stamina gauge permanently and your heart capacity through tackling Shrines which provide often challenging puzzles to complete. Or you could simply cook yourself up a nutritious dish from ingredients you find in the world to temporary boost your stamina, reinforce your hearts, give an attack or defense boost and many, many more. You can approach any combat encounter in any way you see fit, the only limit is your imagination and creativity and it's truly staggering how many different ways there are to dispatch your enemies.

I have put maybe 25-30 hours into the game so far and I've barely touched the main quest. So why then can I make an informed opinion of game if I haven't completed it? Well to sum it up, the game is so teaming with wonder and new discoveries that I keep getting sidetracked but to experience the games many delights, the individual moments that leave you in awe or truly surprise you whether it's a radiant event happening in the world or a side-quest or a new discovery, these are the moments that you will remember this game for. These individual parts come together so well it's hard not to be just taken aback by the many, many unique encounters and interaction with this incredible world.

There aren't enough superlatives to sum up how much this game excels on so many levels. Whether it's in it's lavishly realized world, it's deep and challenging combat, puzzles, random encounters, discoveries or in it's trump card: the limitless freedom it offers in traversing and tackling this world. Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece that just draws you deeper and deeper into its world, it just fills me with a childlike joy and wonderment that I'm playing this game. Almost 20 years after I had Ocarina of Time and an N64 for Christmas where I was introduced to this world for the first time and now this. A culmination of everything Nintendo has achieved and where it could potentially soar in the future. This is a landmark title, the greatest Zelda game ever made and arguably one of the greatest games ever, if not the greatest.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Jguy100,08-03-2017,"DO NOT LISTEN TO ALL THE HATE SURROUNDING THIS GAME. All of these are just from the haters and well...what can you do? All they complain is about the graphics (great for a nintendo game), framerate (I admit it gets annoying at first but you get used to it), resolution blah blah blah not to their liking or just comparing to other games which are different when I'm sure they have not played or fully understood this game themselves. These things are not an issue to me. JUST ENJOY THE GAME!!! Now on to the review...(no spoilers). Note: Not a total nintendo fanboy, I also love playstation and my pc so no bias here although am a huge zelda fan.

Holy mother of pineapples! This game is so amazing. Just the feel of the game, gameplay, graphics (for a nintendo game), and story are so well done. I have been a huge zelda fan since oot and can definitely say this game can really go toe to toe with the perfect game that was oot. How the game puts you in a huge world like in this game and basically just tells you to have fun is just what makes it so fun for me. You make the decisions on what you want to do in this game compared to the past games that were more linear and forced you to follow a smaller path. There are so many mechanics in this game and I still think I haven't learned all of them. This game is all about exploration, discovery, adventure, and of course being an awesome hero that will save Hyrule. Story is not totally up there but is understandable to how this game is with its gameplay and open world to explore, do love seeing all the well done cutscenes when they pop in though.. So many barriers were broken with this game in the Zelda franchise which makes me have hope in Nintendo again to bring more great experiences in the future instead of always using the same old same old with some of their other franchises. The game is hard to put down after playing it...sadly my body needs sleep, food, and bathroom needs. Bravo to Nintendo. GOTY 2017 contender for me personally.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

mrleonels,09-03-2017,"Being the first open world Zelda game, I was scared this was going to be a vast world with a bunch of empty space or mindless filler (i.e. Twilight Princess) but WOW was I proven wrong. There is SO much to do in this game outside of the main story. Simply exploring this world is incredibly fun and addicting. The fact that you can climb ANY surface of the enormous main map just adds to this excitement. Simply explaining it doesn't do it justice. You can only understand by playing it. This is my favorite Zelda game of all time and that makes me so happy because I was waiting for this game to come out for 3 years. So satisfying to finally play it. Also, it's a BEAUTIFUL game (art style and story).",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

kevincox,09-03-2017,"Beautiful game. Seriously made the purchase of my Switch worth it. The game is very difficult if you don't manage your resources. Learn to cook meals and elixirs. Otherwise, you'll be getting 1 hit killed later in the game. I personally really enjoyed the shrines but I do miss the traditional dungeons of past Zelda games.

jasoncross,09-03-2017,"As a lifelong Zelda fan, I didn't think I'd like this game. The trailers made the game seem less like Zelda, and more like an Elder Scrolls/Far Cry kind of game. I was worried that Nintendo was trying something a little to radical. Boy was I wrong. Once you put in a few hours, you'll feel at home. It's a Zelda game at its core. The world is so lovely. I almost hate defeating the enemies because they're so cute. The piano driven soundtrack mixed with the sounds of nature give this game a beautiful vibe. I'm playing this game with my sister, and we're switching off between shrines. I love being able to stop time and use the magnet to drag objects out of the water. I also love how the arrow arc in the air. It makes the aiming feel accurate since bows don't behave like arrows. I'm really excited to see what more Nintendo has in stock for the Switch. I can't remember them launching a console with a game this good. And that's including Super Mario 64.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Totally went in with no expectations and have been blown away. I've honestly spent so much time climbing and taking screenshots. I haven't noticed any frame drops, but I do play primarily in handheld mode, for what it's worth. The voice acting is nothing special, but it's decent enough. I've only played bits and pieces of Windwaker and Twilight Princess, so this is my first true experience with the series. It's a special game. I don't know why. But if you play it, you'll know what I mean.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
larissayates,10-03-2017,"I'm playing the Wii U version and absolutely love it. The Switch was so expensive and I'm happy that Nintendo didn't move the game to being just for the Switch.

It's a very detailed game, and one that plays wonderfully!!!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
thejay,10-03-2017,"An excellent open world game. Low quality textures and severe performance issues somewhat mar what is otherwise and exceptionally beautiful game. The other games will explain how incredible the world is to explore and how engaging it is. I quite like the equipment destruction mechanic, as it encourages changing of weapons in the early game and keeps combat somewhat fresh even at the end of the game.

Absolutely a recommended buy if you have a system that can play it.

However, the main dungeons while fun are consistently far shorter than would have been ideal from a gameplay stance. The final boss is pretty much a joke, especially its final stage. Post game content is lacking too. If you can beat Ganon, there's one harder superboss and then nothing to do but find collectibles. Despite its huge world, the game feels frustratingly small.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Albrechta23,01-06-2017,"What an adventure. This game really takes all the ideas of the original Zelda and completely changes the Zelda formula in a good way. Open world, amazing new ideas, and totally revolutionizing. Everything you do in this game seems to have some sort of reward, and the way everything was structured was so well done. I like how the game holds your hand a tiny bit in the first area, then once you're done with the first area let's you go completely free. After finishing the epic ending, I would have to say that this is one of my favorite games of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dj_Rand,13-03-2017,"Where to start.. I'll keep this spoiler free. First, I'll list off some negatives about the game, things that I find detract some from the overall gameplay.

Negatives: Durability - Some weapons and shields break extremely quickly. It can be a little frustrating to have your weapon break the moment you have an opportunity to land a few good attacks, if you're not quick with changing it out, you might lose your opportunity entirely. FPS drops/lag - I've had some occassional frame drops in the game, along with one 5-second freeze, that breaks my immersion. Graphics - On the cartoony side, I tend to prefer slightly more realism like Horizon Zero Dawn.

Now for the positives...

Graphics. Yes. I listed the graphics as a negative earlier. I'm extremely mixed when it comes to this games graphics. I often find myself wishing they were a little more sharp / higher res / less fog. But at the end of the day I do think the graphics go very well with the game. I'm not sure a Zelda game would look all that great if it went 100% realistic like Horizon. I find the art style to be very much to my liking. To me it captures the essence of what Zelda is.

Music and Sound. The music and sounds in this game really put me on the edge of my seat. I often find myself being extra cautious when ever the music switches over to something more sinister sounding. Likewise I don't feel the need for that caution when the music is more light hearted. They've struck a really good balance with it, and overall the melodies are pretty good. Some of the combat sounds are very satisfying as well.

No Handholding. This game doesn't hold your hand in the slightest. It leaves it up to you what to do. This could be a negative if you prefer games that tell you exactly where to go, and if you don't like to do your own exploring. There is no right or wrong way to play this game. It feels good and refreshing to be able to just jump into the game and decide to set your own goal on what you want to do. Maybe you want to solve some puzzles by hitting up some shrines. Perhaps you rather farm some badass weapons by killing some monsters. Or maybe you really want to track down those Korok's which are cleverly hidden all over the damn place, as you explore every nook and cranny of the world. Speaking of...

The World. It's huge! I'm probably 30-40 hours in and have only discovered probably about half of the map, maybe less than that. There's so much to see and do it's almost overwhealming! It's designed in a way that really makes you think, even navigating to certain area's can be a little bit of a puzzle at times. The Environments are really varied, too! These can impact Link physically in many ways and adds even more depth to the game.

Detail. There is so very much of it. The weather can change how you go about doing things. Rain can hinder you or help you. Lightning can be helpful or a detriment. NPCs even react to the weather, and often have different dialog during the rain, or different dialog based on what you've accomplished so far. It offers a deep level of immersion that I haven't felt in ages. The world really makes me feel accomplished when I go about finding all these little things in it.

Weapons. I love that there's a bunch of weapons in the game. I'm a little bummed out that they can break, but in the grand scheme of things, there's just so many weapons available after every monster you kill it almost doesn't even matter. This more or less negates most of my negative feelings from above about weapon durability.

Story. It's made in such a way that you aren't bound to a set path in order to experience it. Two people playing this game might do things entirely different ways, and face bosses in entirely different orders. I was not expecting ""feels"" in this game, but, this game triggered that emotional response for me. A particular character had me grinning every damn time he made his iconic pose (which I think has even turned into an internet meme now.) Another had me super sad.

Overall this game is a real gem. There's so much to it, and so much to do and so many ways to tackle problems. I truly hope more game studios look at this game and take notes. This is how you make a giant open world and make it feel alive. I rated this game a 10, as lately it's all I can think about. I have not felt this compelled to play a game in quite some time (and I do an awful lot of gaming.) The pros far outweigh the cons, so much so that I don't even care about the cons. I will not be surprised if this manages to be game of the year.

Offtopic: The people on this website giving this game poor reviews are pathetic. Please ignore these. Most of them haven't even played the game, and yet they're here on some sort of ""crusade"" to lower this games score. I felt compelled to leave a review after seeing several 0's.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dylanjp,17-03-2017,"I never thought I would see the day that a game would out do Ocarina of Time but, Nintendo finally did it. Breath of the Wild is doing what Ocarina of Time did for the franchise almost 20 years ago. Breath of the Wild has redefined what a Zelda game should be. The open world is amazing. You can truly go anywhere you can see. Combat is fun and challenging. You need to work to become strong. While is game is far more challenging than previous Zelda games, its not so challenging that it becomes frustrating. As far as the main quest goes: the story is amazing. Voice Acting is incorporated well. Princess Zelda has real depth to her character and that makes you want to actually try and save her as soon as you can. You choose how to go about your adventure. If you truly want to you can face Ganon right from the get go. Breath of the Wild has incredible replay value once you beat the main quest. I have put over 110 hours into the game so far. I have yet to see the entire world. Even though I have nearly beaten all 120 shrine dungeons, their are still huge sections of the map I still have to explore.
My entire life I have considered Zelda Ocarina of Time to be the best video game of all time, and to be honest I never expected any game to ever be able to surpass it. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild did just that. You can see and feel the amount of work and dedication the developers put into this game. Not only is it the best Zelda game of all time, it is the best video game ever made.

miine,16-03-2017,"Too bad 11 isn' possible. This is not only the best Zelda I've ever played but the best action adventure also. Nintendo leap frogged all others on OpenWorld games. This isn't just ""open"" – its more real then anything else while still keeping the expected Zelda charm.

BotW ist such a leap that giving it anything then a perfect score because of technical issues wouldn't justice it. After playing BotW for over 125 hours I decided that there is a real life too and so I went to see Ganon.

The brilliance of this game is that I didn't want to end it at all. And I still have to discover many shrines, secrets and mini games. Given the non linear structure the puzzles could be be and were – puzzling, as players aren't required to solve them to progress further.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is nothing short of a masterpiece. Everything is clean and polished, from the weather effects actually meaning something for your playing experience, to how exploration is encouraged.

LoZ: BotW, unlike previous Zelda titles, is an open world game. Despite the oversaturation of the genre, BotW manages to be unique and creative at how to present challenge and reward the player for accomplishing it.

Unlike other titles, there is only 4 +1 major dungeons in the game surrounding 4 ""Divine Beasts"" and Hyrule Castle itself. Where it lacks in main dungeons, it makes up for in smaller ""mini dungeons"" called shrines. Every shrine in the game is unique and has it's own mechanic or gimmick, and has 0-3 treasures hidden to find. At the end of each shrine, you get a ""Soul Orb."" collecting 4 of these allows you to trade them in for a Heart Container or a Stamina Container; it is very similar in concept to Heart Pieces in previous games, but much more streamlined and interactive than previous side-quests and minigames.

Side-quests this time around thanks to the open world-ness of the game allow them to be spread out, and can even be a reward for exploration itself. Rather than just give heart pieces or rupees, many will give you rare ingredients for cooking, directions to hidden areas with loot, or more powerful weapons than you would find in the world.

Speaking of weapons, BotW has a weapon degradation mechanic, where most weak weapons shatter after a few blows, while more powerful and rare weapons break much less often. Most reviewers do not like the mechanic, but I personally see why they did so. It forces you to be on par or weaker than the enemies you face, and save the good weapons when you find something much more dangerous. When you have the experience and knowledge where you can find those powerful weapons, it isn't as much of a struggle to replace them.

Having completed most of the game with only the 3 token heart containers, I can safely say: this game is HARD. Difficulty is far too difficult to talk about in depth without spoilers, but it is safe to say that the starting area itself is easy to navigate, but ramps the difficulty up and down at random with enemy placement, environmental conditions, weapon availability, and even (very easy version of) a miniboss. It keeps you on your toes and gets you ready for some of the more difficult sections. Be prepared to get stomped when you get out of there.

The music is the perfect throwback to previous games, incorporating the best of the best songs from Wind Waker to Twilight Princess, and mixing it up enough to make it stand out in the series. From the delicate harp music intermixed with a synth, almost otherworldly melody of Zora's Domain, to the woodwinds calmly blowing away in some of the highlands, it simply cannot get any better than this.

Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is unarguably the best game I have ever played. From the mechanics, to the environments; the side-quests, to the main quest; and everything in-between; this game is glowing with perfection. For all the stuff Nintendo has been doing lately with the community, this more than makes up for it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

therealmattchew,17-03-2017,"Words...words can not explain the excellence of this game....I will pointing out problems I didn't like and the overall majority of things I did like. First off let me just say that if you are confused on if you should buy the game or not BUY IT! It is worth every penny and will give you many memorable, frustrating, and enjoyable moments. The frustrating moments usually turn into moments of joy when you figure out an expertly designed puzzle that can keep you thinking and trying. The story is one of the greatest in history of Zelda (and I have played nearly all other Zelda games). I beat the game in around the 50 hour mark but I did avoid some side quests. Even when I did beat the game I came back just to beat more shrines (which are mini dungeons with puzzles) and complete any other side quests that may be out there. Most people complain the world is ""barren"", but I can reassure you there is plenty to explore and discover. Because I don't want to spoil the game all I will say is in the end I felt sad that the main storyline was coming to an end and I wanted more. The voice acting is splendid and made me feel attached to most of the characters like Zelda. One of the problems I didn't like about the game was the frame drops that happened every now and then (keep in mind this was on the Wii U). This thankfully doesn't take away from the experience and beauty of the world around you. With everything from the individual pieces of grass to the huge mountains in the distance you can get side tracked very easily which makes this game even better. Only focusing on the main story will get you around a 15% completion rate of the game. Besides this there is so much more to discover that I would rather you (the reader and hopefully future player) discover for yourself! This game is a masterpiece and will be remembered as one of the best Zelda games of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
thinknintendo,17-03-2017,"Once in a while a game comes around that completley knocks you on your feet and reminds you why videogames are so great. Whats strange to me is, i would have never expected it to be a zelda game. The thought alone is bizarre , we all expect every mainline zelda game to be really good, as i did with this one. But i have to be honest, i expected it to be “just another zelda.”

My favorite zelda game is the original legend of zelda for the NES. Link to the past on the SNES and Link awakening on the gameboy were amazing games, fantastic even. Ocarina of time was really on a HO Notha level. After that point, sadly, my hype for zelda started to decline. The series was stating to get comfy with its tried and true formula, as were its hardcore fans. Ive always thought zelda could be better, not that Skyward sword, Twilight princess and windwaker were bad games, just that at their core, they were still mimicking the same fomulaic approach. So why or even how would a game thats expected to be good, still blow away expectations as breath of the wild has? By breaking that mold, chewing it up, adding some acorns and mighty bannanas, throwing it in a pan over a fire, and making a monster of a game that absolutley no one expected to be this incredible.

GRAPHICS

The game runs fairly smooth with some slight fps drops in certain moments, never to the point where it interrupts gameplay. Despite being originally developed on the archaic and weak capability of the wiiu, Breath of the wilds graphics are absorbently stunning, every vista looks like a watercolor painting. The character models look great and feel like they fit the fantasy world perfectly. Enemies come in diffrent shapes and sizes, from small bat like keese, to hulking one eyed giant orge like beasts to even bigger enemies(wont spoil it for you) The wildlife in this game is beautiful to look at, even the smallest insect.

GAMEPLAY

Running, jumping, fighting,climbing in Breath of the wild is silky smooth, there is actually so many things and so many controls for link to learn that you might find yourself pressing the wrong button at times, so it does have somewhat of a learning curve, but never to the point where i got annoyed. Link can sprint or climb using his upgradable stamina bar, a feature new to the series. Every weapon that link collects attacks diffrently, and there all fun to use, some more than others (im looking at you boomerang.) You can make food and potions to help you on your quest, this part is actually a lot of fun, as you’ll want to collect as many ingredients: trees,plants,fruits, enemy drops(i mean the list goes on and on.) The abilities that you receive early in the game are also a blast to use, especially paired with the incredible physics engine of this game. its unlike anything you’ve ever played, it really is.

SOUND

Music in this game is also unlike any other zelda game, where other zelda titles, there was always an overworld theme blasting, marching towards adventure no matter what you were doing. This game makes you really feel your surroundings with its soundtrack, it lets the sounds of nature swoop in and take over at times, this mixed with the incredible

.
scenery make for an audiovisual experience thats extremely satisfying. There are excellent tracks in this game, from the celtic sounding theme of hateno village to the jazzy sounds of the goron/valcano theme. There is also remade editions of old favorites. Overall there’s never been a zelda soundtrack with more emotion than in this game.

STORY

The legend of zelda has never been known for its story elements, that being said it has a decent tale told in a very intresting way. Ive been playing about 70 hours, and honestly have not focused too much on reaching the main story plot, that being said from what ive seen, its definitley a step up from previous iterations.

CONCLUSION

Did i think nintendo had it in them to make a game like this? Yes, did i expect it with breath of the wild? NO, but im sure glad they did. As many positive things i have to say about this game, i cant help to assert that you have to play this game to really understand and appreciate it. No review can really do it justice, and with that being said, i give this game a 10/10.

The good: True open word gameplay that gives you a sense of freedom

The bad: slight fps drops in high activity areas

The ugly: Moblin guts? really? eww…",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
koajhunt,19-03-2017,"Without question the best Zelda in years. Though it is unlike any game before it in the series. I could see the more casual Nintendo gamers feeling a bit overwhelmed by the game. Seems like Nintendo was able fuse it's classic franchise with the format of modern day Western open world RPGs. I'm close to completing the main quest but still have a ton of Shrines to complete. That being said, I've logged about 90 hours in the game. Well worth the money.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
NadiaC,19-03-2017,"Amazing Zelda game! I have not felt this addicted to/absorbed in a game since I was 12 years old. I spend the first 30 hours just exploring the world, and by that time I still hadn't visited half of the areas. Now I'm 60+ hours in, and I still feel the need to play whenever it's possible. It's still so enjoyable! There's still so much TO DO!

I especially like:
- That Zelda now has a personality and that she seems smart (she's supposed to represent wisdom after all...)
- Discovering small villages and travellers on the road
- How the world feels alive even in the barren and remote areas
- The short riddle-based shrines
- The magical feeling of discovering something rare and beautiful by accident
- That many of the riddles can be solved in more than one way
- The large variety of weapons (I sometimes wish I could keep them all, but then I would never end up trying new things)
- The paraglider and how it works with the bow. Never gets tiring.

However, I really wish:
- I could register different types of animals than horses
- I could actually pet the dogs (and the foxes!)
- It was possible to do a back-up of my saved game. This would bring me a lot of peace.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Zerasight,19-03-2017,"This is by far the best Game in Nintendos long history of gaming. They went all out on this on and created an nearly perfect masterpiece. Everybody should try out this game if they get the chance and see for themselves why it's so great.

It add's a dynamic that I have grown to enjoy. Honestly, the only thing that irritates me about the game is the cooking. That's it, and its not even that big of a gripe. I just don't like that you can only cook 1 item at a time. Other than that, I am thoroughly enjoying this game.

pablothatsall,19-03-2017,"Uno puede empezar elogiando o criticando, pero es necesario aclarar que da igual cuantas reviews leas o cuantos gameplays veas; nunca será suficiente para juzgar este juego si no lo has jugado y si no le has dedicado suficiente tiempo. Podrías pensar cuando te encuentras ante la pantalla que esto no es más que palabrería; pero si comenzamos a primar el juzgar un juego por el jugarlo se nos irá de las manos todo esto.

Ahora sí, este Zelda Breath of the Wild es un juego mayúsculo, y sí, tiene sus cosillas, pero cuando alguien lo juega todo eso quedará en segundo plano; es absorción y magia, todo bien cohesionado para disfrutarlo en formato portátil o en la TV. Cuando comienzas, te encuentras solo, ante un mundo del que no tienes nada más que lo que alcanza tu vista (hasta que obviamente encontremos el modo de ir rellenando el mapa) y esto liga muy bien con lo que siempre ha sido Link, un héroe callado... Eso es, toda esa falta de información y comunicación inicial nos lleva a sentir que a cada paso nos podemos sorprender.

Y realmente, este mundo sorprende; en cada rincón hay algo escondido; a cada situación podemos decidir cómo resolverla; podemos decidir cuando seguir la historia y cuando acabarla (como si quieres completarla en una hora aunque sea un arduo desafío). Aunque personalmente, recomiendo sacarle el máximo partido a este juego, exprimirlo, recorrer cada punto, llegar a cada entresijo del mapa ya que el juego incita a ello, no solo por objetivos y recompensas, si no porque a nivel de diseño es espectacular.

Espectacular y fantástico, eso es lo que se puede decir; si es cierto que aunque pecan ciertas texturas y la potencia de Switch no esté al nivel de sus compañeras en el mercado en este momento, todo se ha mimado tanto a nivel de diseño que es mágico; pocos juegos pueden asegurarse el lucir bien en los años venideros; sí, envejecerá genial. En resumidas cuentas, si te gusta un juego literalmente bonito, aquí lo tienes, y con tintes de Ghibli, una maravilla.

Pero... ¿sólo me ofrece una experiencia bonita? No, jugablemente es una maravilla, muchos después de ver vídeos pueden pensar que estamos ante una mecánica de Climbing Simulator y no, yo al principio era un poco escéptico respecto al Spider-Link pero luego está todo tan medido en cuanto a la resistencia de Link a escalar, el como se premia el hacerlo o incluso la posibilidad que da para localizar ciertas cosas pues es algo muy enriquecedor. Por otro lado, el sistema de progresión en cuanto a dificultad depende únicamente de nosotros mismos (solo jugando se puede comprender, pero básicamente es fundamentarlo en ""Si vas al grano será más difícil""). Además, si tenemos en cuenta que las armas tienen durabilidad limitada (y muchas de existencias limitada) lo que da un toque muy bueno a al gestión de recursos, aunque quizás se podría haber ajustado mejor la durabilidad de cada arma. Y finalmente en el apartado jugable, destacamos el combate el cual requiere de buen timing si queremos salir airosos de la mayoría de combates.

No voy a comentar el apartado de banda sonora ya que, como es de costumbre en la saga, es de 10 simplemente.

Y quiero darle una mención especial a los puzzles, algo que aunque cueste creer, en un sandbox ha cuadrado a la perfección, dejando clara la separación entre ellos; que viene a ser cada templo.

Finalmente, la narrativa es única en la saga, por primera vez doblada a cada idioma; que se nos presenta, además de los apartados de la historia principal, en forma de fragmentos de recuerdo, muchos de ellos que llegan a tocar la fibra sensible del jugador y que nos hace encariñarnos con más de un personaje. Es lo que venimos acostumbrando en Zelda junto a un plus de sentimentalismo. Y no solo eso, si no que además estos recuerdos podemos decidir si obtenerlos o no, midiendo así también al gusto del jugador la duración de la historia en sí.

En resumen, estamos ante un acontecimiento histórico; una maravilla; no exhento de errores pero tan lleno de virtudes que estos quedarán eclipsados. Y es que un 10 no implica la perfección, si no el ser un referente en el género y en la época. Así, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild, es un juego para disfrutar, sentir, un juego para sentarse ante la pantalla (o sentarse en el bus mientras vamos al trabajo mismamente) y quedarse inmerso ante él; un juego que cumple perfectamente con lo que debe ser un juego y de lo que muchos parecen olvidarse a veces buscando potencia, con este Zelda te diviertes, y eso es lo único que importa.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
GeekOfTime,19-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda Breath of The Wild is my favorite Zelda now. Nintendo Delivered, this game is just amazing. In my Opinion. This Game is Perfect. More Perfect than Ocarina of Time.

Kulkinz,20-03-2017,"This was an amazing game to have. I have been playing for hours, and still not even half way done, just because I keep getting sidetracked. There is so much to do, and so much to see. So what's wrong with taking the back streets? I had to quote that. There is so much to do, that you can't get bored. Sure looking for all 900 korok seeds are hard, but it's satisfying to go through your adventure and see a spot where you get a korok.

Pros:
Voice Acting
Great story
You can literally make an airplane raft and fly to Hyrule Castle.
You can save people getting attacked, then start swinging at them and see them react.
So many ways to do so many stuff
You could run to Hyrule Castle and fight Ganon.
Speed Runs would be awesome to see.
Too much to do
It's Zelda
You can just play it everywhere you go.
The boss fights are fun.
It looks so good
Soundtrack just makes me so happy.

Cons:
The beginning is very difficult
Making me have to think about cons

I hate that people are trying to ruin the rating. This game deserved to be in the top with Ocarina of Time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheRedShadow,21-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Breath taking experience, from the moment you step out into the world and receive a bird's eye view of Hyrule, to the moment you step into Hyrule castle at the end to face Ganon in your Fated battle with Destiny. This game is filled with stunning visuals, and comfortable gameplay, but what is most important is that for everything that this game has changed, it manages to keep the spirit of The Legend of Zelda alive and well. Combat is incredibly intuitive, and in order to truly master it, you are expected to learn combat patterns in a similar, but slightly less punishing manner to Dark Souls. Breath of the Wild may very well be the most difficult of the games in the series, with the fact that at any point in your playthrough, you can encounter enemies who can take your life in an instant if you're not careful or improperly prepared. There is no extended tutorial and the game doesn't hold your hand, but instead offers a very gentle push in the right direction and the option to either take it's hint or do things your own way and in your own order. The story, although a bit light in, holds a surprising amount of depth that can, on occasion, even bring you to tears. It is easy to fall in love with a vast number of the characters. The voice acting, even in English, actually adds a lot to this game as well, my only regret in that regard is that I wish they had done more voice acting for this game. I would have gladly accepted every word being voiced, including words spoken by Link, when you choose your answer to conversations with NPCs. being able to climb or glide your way anywhere in the vast open world is absolutely wonderful, and unlike the majority of Open world games, Breath of the Wild's overworld is not only massive, but full of things to do, see, and explore above and beyond anyone ever expected. The physics engine feels incredibly smooth, and everything has a sort of flow to it that just works. Some instances, such as the final dungeon, kept me at the edge of my seat in suspense and even caused me a number of small heart attacks. This game sets a new standard for Zelda as a franchise, as well as for Open World gaming as a whole. There are a few things I would like to see done differently in future titles but I am not worried as Nintendo has always done a wonderful job making each and every Zelda game it's own unique adventure, all be it that some are better than others. In any case, Breath of the wild breathes beautiful new life into The Zelda Franchise, Nintendo as a company and makes an absolutely wonderful launch title for a charming brand new Nintendo console. It is because of all of these reasons that I give Breath of the Wild a 10 out of 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

vitucovigo,14-06-2017,"For me this game is a SOLID 10/10. Not my favourite Zelda game tho. The open world is fantastic, really well made. It's a masterpiece in all ways: The combat system with parrys, strong charged attacks, weapon durability, jumping attacks,etc. The sound of the game is brilliant with that tiny piano notes, the village OSTs, the hyrule castle theme... And Kass... That bird is my favourite character of the game. His accordion music is INCREDIBLE. I'm always searching for him to stop, chill and listen to his music. And the best part of it is when you complete his missions ( or his questline ) you can hear the hidden final theme that reminds all the players that this game is a The Legend Of Zelda. Also the graphics are amazing. I'm always looking for some extension of grass at high noon to take a screenshot. And talking about screenshots in 50 hours I made 1,000 screenshots. This game is so beautiful. The only bad thing I can say about this game is that for me, like The Witcher 3 is a bit boring to replay. Must own game if you have a switch. Seriously.

Greenbob,22-07-2017,"I really tried to like this game as a sort of returner to the series #linktothepast. Alas, I found the game to be tedious and boring like many of other open world games these days. BOTW has the same rinse and repeat pitfalls of farming materials endlessly for little to no reward, Vapid fetch quests and an almost empty landscape of a sandbox that gives me no immersion.

AnonymousDK,24-04-2017,"A solid game that introduces a fresh take on open world gaming. Unfortunately, it's excellent concept is marred by busy-work tasks, shallow quests, lack of meaningful character development (Protagonist as well as other characters), and unoriginal, lackluster combat mechanics.

One of the saving graces were the shrines that keep you pushing forward as there are a whopping 120 of them. However I feel that this is overkill and reduced the quality and thoughtfulness of individual shrines. With the exception of a few, the vast majority were quite forgettable.

As Gamers we should remember that Epic, Vast, and Quantity, are impressive adjectives, but it does not trump QUALITY.

Many reviews boast the ""You can climb ANY surface"" aspect of this game. I found myself climbing mountains but the drive for me to do so was weak as I knew the prize at the end of this time consuming task would result in a forgettable shrine, or a Chest with a weapon that was often worse than the one I was carrying at the time. The fights that SHOULD have been challenging, were very simple and easy, and required very little effort on my part resulting in a very underwhelming feeling and a lack of accomplishment.

That said, it wasn't a bad game by any means. I did enjoy it to a fair degree. Is it a masterpiece? Is it a so called ""10/10""? I would definitely have to disagree.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Gráficos acordes a lo que se espera, un estilo artístico bien elaborado, música ambiental bien lograda que te hace querer escucharla por mucho tiempo, pequeñas caídas de frames en sitios específicos del juego, pero que no afectan su jugabilidad en ningún momento, dificultad media, sin mayores problemas para vencer a los jefes finales de algunos escenarios.
En términos generales un juego infaltable en la colección de los que tienen una Nintendo Switch, una apuesta segura a la diversión, pues llevo mas de 120 horas jugadas, y solo el 25% del juego completado, falta mucho por explorar y por disfrutar.

tetohmu,25-06-2017,"---> problème de rythme. L'aventure principale est en retrait face au bac à sable. Beaucoup de PNJ mais on ne s'attache pas à eux car on n'est pas contraint à rester dans une zone. Le village de Cocorico est le premier exemple: on peut avancer trop facilement sans se préoccuper des habitants qui vous donnent par la suite des infos pas fraîches quand on va finalement les voir (genre: ""oh, y'a un sanctuaire au-dessus du village"" ""bah, oui, je l'ai fait depuis longtemps"" OU à Elimith: ""oh, t'es nouveau dans le village, je vais être ton guide"" ""je connais merci, j'ai déjà ma propre maison totalement décorée...et qui ne sert à rien"" OU pire quand j'ai déjà l'armure Goron complète et qu'un pauvre PNJ en bas de la montagne me donne une partie de l'armure contre 10 lézards ignifus et te dis: ""si tu veux mon casque...(...)"" ""j'ai le même que toi sur ma tête, pov' nouille..."")
---> Et comment avoir de l'empathie pour eux, ils ne sont pas malheureux. Ces habitants ne sont pas vraiment en danger: les 4 divinités ne font pas trop chier: pluie, tempête au loin, vol au dessus de la tête depuis 100 ans, tourne autour de la montagne sans trop de dégâts... comment se sentir Héros? Je pense qu'il y a gros soucis de scénario, pas assez travaillé, incohérent. Si Link avait 10 000 ans, était amnésique, se réveillait nu dans une forêt et découvrait sa destiné petit à petit... là ça aurait eu de la gueule et on aurait pardonné les errances. Personne ne vous connaîtrait comme dans Majora's Mask et vous créeriez votre propre Histoire de Héros, votre Destiné! Mais non, ça reste cucu.
Ocarina of Time & Majora's Mask tiennent bien plus la route côté scénario/rythme/émotions.
---> J'aurais quand même apprécié de pouvoir pêcher, dans un canoë sur les lacs et de parler à un vieux loup de mer dans un bar, risée du village pour dire qu'il avait vu un monstre dans le lac... mais non, on nous donne tout, les dragons vols tranquilou dans les airs mais personne ne les voit... NON! En plus ces dragons ne sont encore que du farming d'objet.
---> On peut tout escalader! Du coup on abandonne tout le temps son cheval (le premier truc qu'on va chercher pourtant). A ce propos, les stats des chevaux ne servent à rien, qu'est ce qu'on s'en fiche s'il à 2 boost ou 6 limités via une carotte magique. Il aurait justement fallu privilégier le cheval au début, puis introduire l'escalade via un bracelet magique pour ré-explorer le monde.
---> ça manque de souterrains, de grottes à explorer avec une torche, de fonds marins à explorer avec la tenue Zora...
---> le système de potion / tenues / diadèmes est bancal globalement.
---> bombes infinies? Je pense que ce pouvoir était inutile. Il aurait fallu mettre de simples bombes. On aurait pu aisément se passer des quelques énigmes des Sanctuaires les utilisant. Elles cassent le game design.
---> quêtes annexes pas très intéressantes malgré quelques bonnes idées.
---> beaucoup d'aliments pour pas grand chose au final.
---> les 900 korogus... je comprends le design derrière mais j'aurais préféré des mystères plus complexes, tout comme les secrets qui se résument à des babioles dans un coffre. Dommage.
---> tous les ennemis et camps se ressemblent.
---> pas assez de contraintes liées aux monstres, aux évènements. Les camps, les lynels ne protègent rien, n'ont aucune intelligence.
---> aucun temple caché, protégé par un système de protection comme les deux Sphynx dans le film ""L'Histoire sans fin"", aucune grandeur comme la ""Grande Rivière des Terres Sauvages"" dans ""Le Seigneur des Anneaux"" (j'suis pas un fan de ces films, mais des idées de mise en scène).
---> les boss médiocres, que dis-je: A CHIER!! et trop simples. Ganon compris. Ganon est pitoyable notamment sa 2ème forme qui ne ressemble à rien, ne fait rien. On attend un vieux pattern à la noix pour le tuer. Un rip-off dégueulasse de Nago de Princesse Mononoke.
---> les 4 donjons ne resteront pas en mémoire, trop simples.
---> les sanctuaires sont très inégaux, dont 20 épreuves de force. 20! beaucoup trop!
---> J'aurais aimé avoir la musique du village Cocorico dans le Village de Cocorico & un cimetière (vu les morts) et un clin d’œil à l'homme du moulin de OOT dans le village d'Elimith... enfin... c'est bien de se détacher de OOT mais les clins d’œil subtiles auraient fait plaisir.
---> beaucoup de boulot & addictif sauf que, bien que chaque joueur puisse construire sa propre expérience & trajet, tous finiront par faire la même chose encore et encore, rencontrer les même camps et ennemis copié/collé, chopper le même cheval géant inutile au même endroit, faire les mêmes quêtes pourries, telles les tablettes Zora, l'oiseau blanc, les pins alignés, le village d'Euzéro.
---> une bonne direction pour le prochain, enfin débarrassé des médiocres TP & SS.
---> mais encore un Zelda qui n'a rien d'épique.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
NintendoButton,04-06-2017,"When you first start up the game, you are greeted with a small introduction of the controls where Link is lead to a cliff where he looks over the breathtaking world of BoTW. On the Great Plateau alone, you can do so much on such a little portion of the map. When you finally get the para-glider, it feels amazing just to fly off of the Great Plateau into the truly gigantic of world of BoTW. If you wish, you could head straight to the final boss fight where you will almost definitely or head South to the Gerudo Desert or venture to Eventide Island, or get all the Korok seeds, or do all the shrines, or take down all the divine beasts, or chuck a Cucco into Death Mountain, the possibilities are endless. There are some negatives such as the frame drops, frame stutters, crashing and lower resolution, but those are things I'm willing to trade for the amount of content and surprises this game offers. The combat works well, the characters feel as though as they have their own personalities like two villagers having a conversation and are rude to you if they try to talk to you, or kids running around playing while an older villager spends their time resting and gardening, it truly is immersive. The amount of customisability this game offers can fall short at times, but being able to make your armour 15 different colours is amazing.

CHAIRS,07-07-2017,"This is truly, one of the best games I have ever played. It was a blast from beginning to end. It would take forever to read this review which is why I am splitting this in to sections. SECTION 1 Story: Breath of the wilds story isn’t the greatest, but the way you encounter it makes it unique. There is an obvious beginning and end, but everything between that you haft to find. What I mean is LINK has lost his memories so if you want you can go ahead and find them all but this is optional. That is what makes the story so great. The fact that it is OPTIONELL. SECTION 2 dungeons: All though botw dungeons are similar looking they all have some really good puzzles. But they are not as great as others in the franchise but still really good. SECTION 3 BOSSES: this is the one thing I am disappointed about in botw. The bosses all look the same and are WAY too easy. Their AI was good but the bosses would have been much better and memorable if they were more difficult and had different designs’ did like ganons design but then again he was too easy to defeat. SECTION4 Exploration: Exploration in botw is extremely rewarding. There are countless things to collect and so many awesome places to find. Every time I thought ""are there any new cool places left in this game „I found another awesome place. OH and there are 120 shrines to find... SECTION 5 Shrines: Shrines are very rewarding to find. They often times have great puzzles. But there are some Filler shrines and those are combat shrines. They are very lazy since there are plenty of enemies to kill in the vast world of hyrule. But for the reason that they are all so rewarding to find I loved all shrines SECTION 6 gameplay: The best gameplay in a videogame. You can literally go anywhere you want. You see that mountain over there? WELL NOT ONLY CAN YOU GO TO IT BUT YOU CAN ALSO CLIMB IT. You can climb on pretty much any surface and it is great. You also can friking surf on a shield. And you have countless attack abilities which brings me to SECTION 7 Combat: Combat in botw is great. You have so so so much variety on how to kill an enemy I FRIKKEN LOVED IT. SECTION 8 Enemies: extremely smart AI and a good amount of difficulty. I thought some of the mini bosses were much better than the bosses. Lynels were 10000 times harder than any of the actual bosses. So overall the enemies were great and I had so so much fun fighting them. SECTION 9 MUSIK: even though botw musk isn’t as memorable as in other Zelda’s a lot of the music is outright amazing. If I could I would give this game a 98 out of a 100.This and super Mario galaxy 1 and 2 are my favorite games of all time. And if you think this Game is overrated and haven’t played it you are missing out on one of if not the greatest Game of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lamon,07-06-2017,"This is an amazing game. Surely it isn't perfect, but you can't give it less than 9/10, especially if you tried the game; only haters do that. It isn't the best looking game ever, but it is still awesome.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

KhuntyMcGee,11-06-2017,"I've been a Zelda fan since I was 5 years old, I am now 24.

The bosses in this game to get very repetitive though because they are just different variations of Ganon, but the game is still amazing and I highly recommend it, but the weapon breaking can be a bit bad, but it all makes up for it with the amazing gameplay and game design. 9.5 out of 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aldeberuhn,18-06-2017,"This game is absolutely breathtaking in its visual design, and the ability to explore the world of Hyrule at your own pace and in your own manner is a wonderful addition to the Zelda franchise. Being able to experiment with different ways to approach the same obstacle is another great feature of this game. If I had to name one thing that disappointed me about this game, it would probably be the lack of a fully fleshed out storyline, but the game makes up for it with the bits and pieces they do provide. The story itself is the most compelling of any story the Zelda series has told before, so that just makes me want more of it. Nintendo has already announced DLC that will expand on the game's story, however, so I can't really complain. I recommend this game for just about everyone, whether you've been interested in Zelda games in the past or not. It is definitely a game that will stick with you over time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
1doughboy221,25-07-2017,"NOTE: If you don't feel like reading this long review, skip to the end for a summary.

As a someone who has beaten almost every game in the series, I can say with certainty that while The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the most unconventional game in the Zelda series, Nintendo still managed to succeed in making one of the best Zelda games to date; however, that's not to say that this game is not lacking of shortcomings that hold it back.

This game is absolutely amazing; it's perhaps the first open world game that I've played that doesn't hold your hand or clutter your map with waypoints and icons when you unlock the obligatory tower for certain areas of the map. Nintendo did well in creating a game that allows the player to truly explore at the player's own volition. Furthermore, the open world is not only expansive, but the basic physics of the game make sense and are not isolated, but rather the mechanics work together in ways that will continue to surprise the player. With a plethora of things at your disposal, this game makes good use of the map (for the most part).

The only real grievance that I have with this open world is the space in between points of interest. many people complain about how the world seems ""too barren"" or ""empty,"" but I think that the negative space there is good and keeps the map from being cluttered. The thing that I have a problem with, however, is the repetitive filler that is spread throughout areas that are obviously not as busy as others. It doesn't take long to realize that the same minibosses such as hinoxes or lynels, or the exact same skull shaped bokoblin encampments are litttered all over the map. What's perhaps even worse are the same, monotonous korok puzzles that are scattered across Hyrule. Furthermore, it doesn't take long for the player to realize that the various sidequests are relatively similar, and the reward for such sidequests is either a punitive amount of money, or a weapon that's most likely just as strong as the ones in your current inventory.

As far as the score, Nintendo doesn't fail to amaze the player in beautiful soundtrack. However, Nintendo falls a bit flat on implementing this wonderful music. Much like the map, the music is great in areas that are obvious points of interest, such as towns and shrines, but in areas where there is a lull, the music is a bit lacking. I know that Nintendo stated that they were going for a very melancholy journey that is accompanied with ambient noises rather than a real score, but for a company that is well known for their dynamic music and adaptive soundtracks, it's a bit disappointing to see that Nintendo didn't take this route for a title as large as Breath of the Wild.

Many people herald the combat as ""the best in the Zelda series to date,"" and I would have to agree. But on the same note, it's sad to see that for a series as old as Zelda, the combat has only evolved to this state. Sure, the combat is unique for a while, but again, its charm wears off and the player soon realizes that there isn't really any difference in the weapons throughout the game other than the way they look and the damage they deal. Even the special weapons still manage to be not interesting; for instance, the elemental weapons or the guardian weapons are certainly interesting, but there's a spear, an axe, and a short sword for both of these weapon types, so they become less unique and less rare than you'd initially expect. Sure, there are some unique weapons such as the windcleaver, the boomerangs, or the magic rods, but they all seem to suffer from some mechanic where they have a fixed damage. So, while interesting to use, their fixed, weak damage output eventually makes them ineffective and obsolete once the player has progressed far enough into the game. Even worse, the combat in this game is plagued by the rudimentary ""sit and wait for the oppoent to show his weakspot"" based combat that is commonplace in all of the 3D Zeldas, and gimmicky mechanics like the perfect dodge don't help.

Dungeon design, however, is the best it's been in the 3D Zelda series. The main dungeons, while suffering a lack of any sort of unique theme, including the bosses (a problem that hasn't been seen since A Link to the Past), follow a more systemic and exploration basis for puzzles that will please those who favor a Link to the Past or the Oracle games, while the 120 shrines have the smaller, bite-size gimmick-based puzzles that fans of Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess will enjoy.

Summary:
+ Great open world that doesn't clutter your map or hold your hand
+ Interesting and fun physics that allow the player to interact with the large world
+ Best dungeon design in 3D Zelda to date
+ Amazing soundtrack and music
- The filler in the open world is repetitive
- Combat, while the best in the series, is still rudimentary and gimmicky
- Weapons are ""cookie-cutter"" and flawed
- Soundtrack is lacking where needed",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mikelim2000,26-09-2017,"Game is good for the most part but there are lots of issues that made the game, at least for me not that great. I'm sure many of you already know some of the main complaints but I'll list mines here.
1. Weapons break too easily
2. If weapons in your inventory is all good quality you will not want to fight any monsters because you don't want to damage them. This makes you as a player less engaged in fights, more than likely you will run past mobs of monsters instead of fighting and wasting all that gear being damaged.
3. Lots of monsters are actually a waste of time if you fight them, the reward is sub par, you actually lose more fighting monsters than gain.
4. Lack of music. Music is what make Zelda games memorable. After I beat this game (130 hours?) I did not have that attached feeling or that type of feeling like wow this was awesome. Lots of games have music so good where after 6+ years that you have beaten it, you will get this nostalgia feeling when you hear that music again. Zelda BOTW has NONE! Kinda sad really.
5. This game to me was not hard enough, especially at the last climb to Hyrule castle. I beat the whole castle and Gannon using only one heal potion.
6. Master Sword is not a master sword after all because if DOES break even when fighting Calamity Gannon minions, sure it lasts longer but it should not break at all.
7. Zelda is the most annoying character in the game, she treats link like trash even when hes trying to help her. I don't know why he is even protecting her.
8. Nearly all side quests have little to no reward. After you finish each side quest you will be questioning yourself like ""I spent 4 hours on this side quest and I got 100 rupees are you kidding me?""

Other than those complaints this game is pretty good and very addicting. Is it better than Ocarina of Time? No. Is it worth the $60 for the cartridge? Definitely. I don't think anyone should skip this game, it is a must play.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
RoadToChaos,04-10-2017,"Zelda: Breath of Wild is a fun game, even at the worst time it still had me on the edge of my seat. While the entire story is told in flashbacks, that and the side missions are boring, while not the best Zelda game, it is a great game that looks like it really did take years, Nintendo did a mediocre job at some things but they really did it this time.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ocarina_Crews,02-02-2018,"A masterpiece, open-world done right and playing it is just a fun thing to do. BoTW treats the series in a very different way, yet it has high enough quality it can be argued to be the best Zelda ever made. It sure is a true contender for it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kacek1996,02-01-2020,"This game is a pure gem in the decade. Gorgeous, open world that sometimes feel empty. Great climbing mechanics, awesome diversity in equipment with the possibility to match whatever equipment you want. I do appreciate the weather cycle and the aspect of enemy respawning with red moon. The controls are really smooth and the game has good animations. I was shocked that weather can damage me through the equipment I wore. Quite a good pool of the enemies to fight (lizards were my favourite ones). I enjoyed the plot development, the idea of not making it an important thing. The plot is just a thing for the people who wants to enjoy it. Also, I adored the amount of collectibles things like shrines and koroks (I've got all the shrines, but I've got only 200 koroks). Cities with different races were a nice touch (I do not remember names of the races, but bird people have the best designs out of those 4 races in my opinion). Bosses and puzzle elements were fun and sometimes somehow challenging. Overall, breathtaking game that I think I will play more after some time (I've played it for around 99h). I do truly recommend it, I even think it's worth the full price! (It was my very first Zelda game) [I posted my review in september 2019, but I had to update it, and that's why there is such a date]",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mattzideaz,01-01-2020,"Breath of the wild is a great zelda addition. The cooking mechanic of the game is good, and the enemies vary nicely in difficulty. Always room for improvement, but amazing in most ways. Where do the unlimited blue bombs come from?",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Morrigan99,17-06-2020,"I tried to like this game but I cannot. I like the inital exploring and walking around but after a while it gets really boring, really fast. (I'm 50 hours in) There is no sense of progression. You can do shrine quests (to get more hearts or stamina) but that gets very old after a while and there is no other way to improve those stats. If you find you don't like those shrines (like me) you are in for a bad time. You can also search for korok seeds to expand the inventory (which is also not very fun) or do some of the sidequest. (which are often fetch quests) The story is lackluster and you don't really get to care for the characters. The weapon system is the worst I've seen in a while - ""burning"" through weapons is not fun and rewarding in any way for me - you can get used to it but you'll end up not using certain cool weapons in fear they might break. This is not fun. I liked the paragliding and climbing in the game, as well some of the physics mechanics. The cooking and dyeing was cool but I missed more crafting mechanics like that, as well more armor and enemy variety. For someone who never played an open world game I could recommend it, for anybody else: be wary. Borrow it from a friend or something to see if you like it.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

KO-san,04-03-2017,"You can tell who hasn't played this when they repeat stuff like ""no voice acting"" and ""empty world"". Even people saying it runs at ""20fps or lower throughout"". While docked it certainly does dip every now and again, but it isn't nearly as bad, mostly hitting the 30fps mark and never dipping below 20fps. Calling it slow to load is also objectively wrong, considering it takes a fraction of the time discs take to load and without mandatory installs.

This said, in lieu of the hundreds of false reviews from less than trustworthy users, the game is astonishing. The aesthetic (because it is an artistic direction, not graphics) is beautiful, and with the true to life ambience and fluid animations, it is something that draws you in and keeps you there. It is easy to pick it up for a quick session only to find that hours have passed. There's lots to do in between the 120 shrines and 900 hidden Korok puzzles, including cataloguing items in the world and experimenting with different recipes or just exploring the freedom of the physics engine created, something not common in such large games. NPCs are colorful themselves, flush with personality and providing optional quests for the player should they seek them out. The musical score, while much more hushed and stoic in comparison to the previous entries' adventurous beat, is a welcome change of pace especially for such a large world. The voice acting, a first for the series, is great as well and not something I thought would have been handled as well as it did.

All in all, I stand by the critics. The game is fun, engaging, and a welcome entry for anyone interested in the genre and willing to give it the time of day.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This was also released on the best handheld console ever made, so, there's that.

I'm telling you this, Breath of the Wild has everything... yes, every... single... thing that made Ocarina of Time look like a masterpiece. This is the lost brother of Ocarina of Time and the true brother Ocarina of Time will ever need.

The way they tell the narrative in this edition of Zelda is really a breath of fresh air on the series, don't listen to any of the negative comments on the game just play it and enjoy. one last point too, I cannot understand how they have got the game to run on a handheld too, just the option to just pick it out of the dock and go anywhere and get about 3 hours of play time on the game is amazing.

Anyways, I had my doubts when I saw the 98 average, but after putting time into this game, I'd have to say it's quiet deserving, and this is coming from somebody who played a lot of MMORPGs and open world games while being primarily a PC gamer.

10 points review: People that actually played the game
0 points review: Sony fan-boys that are pissed about the game been so good and trying to get the score down (Literally, just read)
This is dumb, and not even useful in anyway, but whatever.

The game: Is not a 4k HD FULL 40 DLC 60 fps game like kids like this days. Its just another Nintendo almost-perfect game made by the best on the company. Just that and nothing else.
Zelda has always been good, but THIS is something way different, this one tries to expand a lot more, even, tries to let the old Zelda meta behind, this is diferent, this is not ""another zelda"", is a new formula, and you know what? it works. It FEELS like a Zelda, but totally new, open world, and way, way, WAY longer in playtime, and probably even with a lot more of replayability.

The music (so far) doesn't feel as good as the old Zelda games, but that is a really BIG standard to go in the first place, maybe when it gets some years we will get the ""nostalgia effect"" on its songs. But about dungeons (Or shrines), and the main story in general... i have nothing bad to say.

With this game Nintendo accomplished to bring the genre of ""open world games"" to a whole new level, which will heavily influence the entire gaming industry. This will improve the overall quality of a lot of future games and thus our experience as gamers.

That's why I don't understand the seething rage of fans of other console companies, which are dropping their 0/10 scores here. When The Last of Us came out, I was so happy about this masterpiece and followed everthing about this game. Even with the fact I did not own a PS 3 at this time.

In conclusion, it's safe to say that this game is GOAT and no amount of 0/10 rage scores can change this fact. I wish all fellow gamers a lot of fun with this game - you will vividly remember playing this game for a very, very long time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

NessJWimbleton,06-03-2017,"The good:

-Exploration; The world is big with many things discover and do, is not dense but is really fun to travel with any method you choose.
-Puzzles: Fun and varied puzzles based mostly on physics, they range from very easy to mind twisting.
-Cooking: Simple yet fun, encourages experimentation and gives purpose to a lot of items you'll find in your travels
-Varied sidequest: without spoiling them, most are fun and varied, with interesting sidestories, yet there are still some fetch ones

The bad

-Story: average at best, nothing new or groundbreaking is preseted, it's almost non existant, however the sidequest stories and the contextual storytelling are a little better
-Weapon break system: coupled with the bizarre item interface can become very annoying very quickly
-Repetitive in the final strech: Can become very repetitive near the end game thanks to the simple combat, the weapon break system mentioned and the fact that youll get most of the abilities in the beggining of the game
-Graphical issues: from really low textures to framerate issues, there are a lot that are present on both versions and can be really distracting

Como gran innovación destacaría su estilo visual artístico, que nunca antes se ha utilizado en un videojuego y que funciona genialmente con la jugabilidad. También hay que destacar que la jugabilidad es tremendamente abierta, y es de agradecer que se recuperen elementos de mundo abierto que videojuegos mas recientes han obviado (como mecánicas de supervivencia).

Es una pena ver todas esas praderas sin nada, como si de una textura plana se tratara. Por otro lado, este juego ha sido utilizado por Nintendo como su putita para vender la Switch. De ahí los multiples retrasos y el mal rendimiento, ya que es un port de wii u, que al intentar hacerlo mas grande, ha jodido las 2 versiones. El juego es bueno y negarlo es de necios. Quizá el mapa no debería ser tan grande y hacer algo más pequeño pero más vivo. Aclaro, como no hacéis muchos de vosotros (haters o fanboys) que NO he jugado al juego. Y NO hace falta. La historia? Hay que vivirla. No son ni buenas ni malas, son lo que son. El juego se ve bonito, especialmente cuando no tienes una pradera vacía en tu cara. Hay torres de viaje rápido desde cualquier punto del mapa (sigh). El combate es regular. Lo juzgamos como videojuego, no como Zelda. Hay videojuegos con sistemas más avanzados que ya llevan en el mercado años. En fin, un buen juego de Nintendo. Simplemente.

darkaoron,04-03-2017,"This game does so well for the franchise as a whole in its method of telling the same story as the other Zeldas but still keeping it interesting, and its changes to a more simpler but more engaging combat system. I feel like the game has been truly modernize by sacrificing the stapled formula of the old 3d Zelda games in order to give the game an open endedness but still having the Zelda feel. The major issue with this change in format though is that there was nothing wrong with the old way of doing things, and this will cause a lot of fans looking for the same old Zelda to feel like their beloved game has been forgotten. Nintendo has definitely tried to please everyone by throwing in mini-dungeons all across the world to fill in for the lack of open world puzzles that old Zelda titles had, but even these didnt consume that Zelda feel that i wanted in a Zelda game. This game is fun and i love playing it but it also makes me a bit sad as i'm worried that my old Zelda games will no longer be made. My nostalgia for the old format grows as i look for something to fill that gap. The best way i can describe this game as a hard core zelda fan is this.. I feel like i had a relationship with the old style of combat/worlds of zelda but that relationship had to end, and this new format that i know is better has come into take its place, yet i still linger and miss the old relationship i had with the Zelda franchise. This unfortunately will cause a split in the fan base for some time, as some players will want to hold onto that nostalgic style of gameplay for its comforting and familiar.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Breath of the Wild is like the exploration of a ghibli movie world completely on your own and in your own pace. It is the best game I've played within the last 15 years out of hundreds and I can recommend this for everyone who is interested in those type of games.

It's not trying to be anything but Zelda, and rating it a 10 does not diminish any other open world games - it doesn't make Skyrim LESS good, and it doesn't make the Witcher 3 LESS enthralling. Those games set out to do what they meant to do, and did it extremely well! Likewise, Breath of the Wild crafts a beautiful open world in which Link can do whatever he wants. The graphics are absolutely beautiful - again, this doesn't diminish the more realistic graphics of Horizon, nor does it mean that it's the defining animation to change the world - but it makes the world look & feel more alive than any other world I've ever explored.

I just couldn't stop playing, the hours passed so fast I hadn't realized I had logged in around 15 hours in a single day. I was completely submerged in this incredible fantasy world. The sense of wonder and discovery was something I don't think I've ever experienced in a video game before and everything else just feels right.

As an owner of PS4, Xbox One, and a Switch, I believe that Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is the best exclusive of all time. closely followed by the Uncharted and Forza series. A great step forward for nintendo which has given me and many other switch owners confidence that the switch will go strong for years to come as one of the best consoles out there. Even if the Great Plateau was the size of the whole game it wouldn't be awful, there is so much to do all around the area and it only gets better when you leave. Great job nintendo!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Naessarne,13-03-2017,"First off - I can't believe the reviews marked zero. If you hate Nintendo there are plenty other consoles and games to enjoy, go play them!

For me (after some 25 hours played) this game is a ten.

Its not without its minor issues and i'll talk about them first. Frame rate - there are some spikes when playing in TV mode but nothing to write home about. Voice acting - I LIKE the Zelda typical 'grunts' and 'whoops' that accompany the story text. In some instances (little Zora kids singing) it is positively adorable and in other cased (Giant Fairy) it is...well...blush...see for yourself. BUT when one of the characters does speak, particularly a female character, it is with one of those British/English accents that doesn't exist. You know the kind the Queen has...

That aside there is A LOT to love about the game.

Open world - its stunning in scope, scale and graphical style

Puzzles - some of the negative reviews have bemoaned the lack of Zelda typical 'dungeons'. Trust me there are loads. Between the hugely varied shrines (combat/physics type/or traditional elemental puzzles) and the pre-boss fight mini dungeons there is more than enough to keep you amused and occasionally frustrated

Combat - as varied as the fragile weapons in your inventory. Only got arrows? Blow up an explosive barrel or sneak and try for a head shot. Only got a leaf? (yeah I said a leaf) - drop a spherical bomb and 'blow' it into a pack of enemies. The possibilities are endless.

Story (from a half way through position) - engaging characters, funny and heat breaking all at once

Side quests - range from the sublime to the ridiculous. Like the kid who wants to see all the weapons in the world so he can show his grandad when he 'see's him again'

A must play game if you like the Zelda series and great fun for any RPG fan",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hummus4ever,16-03-2017,"Fantastic, I've been having a great time with it! The graphics are beautiful, the world is huge, and it feels like as though everything in the game was extremely well thought out. I'm 50 hours in and not even close to being done.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kerzun,16-03-2017,"An amazing experience coming from the good guys at Nintendo, yet another great notch on the Zelda franchise's belt, while at first I wasn't sure if I should get their new console just for this game ultimately I decided to give the switch time to cook, but even so, I could not stop myself from getting the game for the Wii U
-after all, how could I?, when all my friends kept raving about how great the game was day in and day out, so I bought it thinking I had to see this for myself.

And what i found was that they were right for once, the world was vast and open, and while having simpler esthetics when compared to other great looking, similar games like Horizon zero dawn, which I also played recently, it doesn't distracts but adds to the experience with a very vibrant colorful pallet no matter where you go.

The story is rich and interesting as you go around the land with no memories trying to piece things together from what you hear from all the interesting NPCs that populate the massive landscape.
There are lots of things to see at every corner, from cooking and crafting, to gathering so many items an infinite inventory was a necessity.

The sound design while lesser than the other Zelda games is every bit as impactful as it kicks in at just the right moments, when you actually encounter someone playing music in the middle of vasts expanses of grass to when you wonder into a lively village or town full of interesting npcs and life... meanwhile the moments of silence are also well done, as while you explore nature you are greeted with the distant chirps of birds or the low growls of enemies hiding behind some rocks, or the sound of water as it rushes past into a massive waterfall.

but abode all the reason for my grade is that this game managed to make me feel great exploring again. the way they have made they AI for enemies and the world design with physics just makes things feel alive... like a huge sandbox for me to play and discover new things in... not since my time with Minecraft had I felt like this in a game and for that I give it my highest rating, as unlike Minecraft this game actually has a great story to boot.

10/10 flawless and fun.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Whiteshard,03-03-2017,"It's rare for me to review a game and this would be my very first on Metacritic. Very seldom does a game actually affect me that I give it a perfect score. And I remember DOOM being the last game that I considered this good.

Ever since the first trailer, I knew this was going to be different. As a fan of Ghibli, the semblance hit me like a breath of cool air, refreshing and nostalgic at the same time. And to think it would come from a franchise that I had only read comics about, and seen videos of on the internet. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild quickly made a place for itself in my heart and mind, How long I had waited to finally play this. And the day finally came.

Now, I've been playing this for a couple of hours, but I am pretty sure my mind won't change given how it was made a few months ago. With some of my favourite games being To the Moon, Kingdom and DOOM, graphics hardly mean a thing to me, not unless the art is not done well. And with the idea of the Switch not being a hugely powerful system and given the scope of the game world itself, the game is visually breathtaking. There has not been a moment yet when I decided to look away from the game, almost like I came across a magical landscape through a hidden window somewhere, I want to absorb what I see, I want to believe that I am right there. I can say this much, that I cannot even begin to justify the sheer beauty of what is seen with the words I use.

And with beauty of sight, a very necessary detail that is needed is the beauty of sound. And the game delivers on that front. With music inspired heavily from Joe Hisaishi's works from classic Ghibli films, it is clear that the game developers were aiming for magic. And magic they conjured. Subtle and varied, the music itself is scarce in a world so alive. And that is where sound design comes in. Imagine you are standing in a magical forest. And there's the sound of the wind and birds, the sound of leaves and rain. A heavy portion of what you hear is filled with sounds like these, making it almost believable that you are there, in person. And that is what a game should set out to do in the first place, to immerse you in a new and mystical world.

Art is usually what I am looking for in a game (my favourite games of all time : Ori and the Blind Forest, Transistor, To the Moon, Kingdom, Crypt of the Necrodancer, DOOM, Portal 2, Journey, ABZU, Firewatch, Minecraft, etc). So, it comes as a surprise to me that I want to talk about the gameplay itself. It's another first for me. The gameplay is surely refreshing, not to mention it being difficult. This isn't the frustrating difficulty that comes with games like Geometry Dash and similar games, This is the kind of difficulty that makes you wonder whether your own actions are worth the time. How you choose to take out an enemy requires not only planning, but also needs you to have to improvise as you go. Because no matter how much you perfect your fighting, things can be very different for you as you go along. The little things like weapons breaking, the weight of weapons affecting what you do, the material of the weapon allowing for environmental interactivity, the game delivers a unique style of world interaction and gameplay mechanics that I had found missing is games like Skyrim and The Witcher 3.

All in all, I do believe that I am selling this game short. It has been a while since I have played a game this beautiful and enchanting. A visual and aural masterpiece. The Legend of Zelda : Breath of the Wild is an experience and falls into the category of games like Firewatch, Journey and The Witness. I simply cannot not recommend this to anyone just because of fear of holding them back from an experience this good.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SkeletonCross,29-04-2018,"This game had promise. It was hyped enough, but did it live up to hype ... no. Let me start by saying everything in the game feels extremely repetitive. The game is different shades of blue, green, or brown. So imagine how old it gets looking at the same color palette the entire game. The texture resolution is terrible, and the framerate stays at 20-30 the entire game. There are many complaints I have with this game I will list them. I would like to start off with fact you can't repair your weapons. Weapon durability systems are great, but the system of weapon Durability in Breath of the Wild is disgusting. Either 1 to 2 enemies you fight the weapon freaking breaks seriously 1-2 enemies. That's an extreme joke the fact this is spose to be a AAA game shouldn't make this ok. The second point is there's a shortage of enemy designs in the art department. It feels like there's 3 enemy types and that's it everything looks the same during your 40+ hours of playing the game. The 3rd point is the shrines look exact the same with 3 different puzzle types that are extremely easy to complete. Every shrine feels exactly the same and detracts you from the ""adventure"" of the game. I seriously couldn't take going thru 1 more freaking shrine it drive you nuts. My 4th point is the ""Temples"" are easy and the bosses in them are easy as well. This drove me bonkers. I've played every single Zelda game and this one removed the best part of Zelda and that's the dungeons with the great bosses. Not only do the devine beast look the same they don't vary in design one bit. It's sad when the best part of the franchise was removed. This game was a let down. My final point is the game was overall TOO EASY! They put a minimap, gave you a bright orange dot on where to go. THIS ISN'T ZELDA. They have never told you where to go or gave you a minimap. Like seriously how stupid are people today? What made Zelda great was the sense of adventure, and the freedom of not know what you were doing. You had to figure it out as you go. Well in this game they just tell you and show you were to go instead of setting you free with no direction. Zelda Ocarina of Time had that feeling and had a sense of difficulty that Zelda will never have anymore. The ruined Zelda and should stop making it. I have never felt this mad over a zelda but seriously Zelda shouldn't feel this easy. There's no difficulty anymore there's no sense of awe. There's not that amazment that makes me want to go back to Zelda unless they go back to the style of ocarina of Time. People need to stop having their hands held the entire way. This generation will never know what Zelda was truly like and that's sad, because Zelda used to be something magical now it's something that belongs in the TRASH.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
WildFire15,05-03-2017,"Before you buy Breath of the Wild, be aware that this is a big departure from the Zelda games we've been enjoying since Link to the Past. That isn't a bad thing, but it's been interesting seeing the reactions to it (some of who I think want to 'balance out' the scores the game's been getting).

To me, Breath of the Wild gets open worlds right in a way other open world games have forgotten; made the world feel like one consistent and meaningful place you can explore at will. You're rarely pointed straight at an objective, usually only given a rough idea of it's location and allowed to find it yourself, traversing across plains, mountains, swamps, deserts and so on to find it. Contrast that with Just Cause, where you have your objective marker, either steal a vehicle or parachute/wing suit your way over the terrain without any real need to pay it any notice, making it more a commute then an adventure.

There's a lot to find and do, but it's all technically optional as you can head straight to the end of the game once you leave the plateau at the beginning. There's four dungeons and 100 shrines to find around the world, their challenges based mostly on puzzles utilizing abilities you unlock at the beginning of the game rather then finding an item within them to continue. In another change, combat has dropped it's flashier abilities but added more options in alternative weapons (swords, spears, axes, bows as well as boomerang swords as well as stealth options) which you'll have to switch between to maintain as each will eventually break. The lack of ability to repair or forge your own is disappointing, but you'll find weapons all over the world, either taken off enemies, laying around or in chests. You can also get difference clothes that give added protection from attacks, weather conditions or even new abilities.

I've been playing solidly for about 20 hours, completing 1 main dungeon and about 20 or so shrines while making my way anti-clockwise around the map and I can see why this game's thought of so highly. I like to go walking up mountains in real life and I've never had the feelings of accomplishment in reaching the top and planning which one to climb next or whereto go from the view in a game before. Breath of the Wild returns to the open world something it had almost forgotten; a sense of real, open adventure.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Nephrited,04-03-2017,"I'm now about 18 hours into BotW and thus far it's worth every piece of the praise it's been given by reviewers. An excellent world, possibly the first time I've ever played an open world game where the open nature has been truly positive, interesting puzzles (the Zelda element), and new gameplay from a series I had previously thought to be getting stale. An incredible comeback from the mixed bag that was Skyward Sword.

The only negative I've found so far, and what's preventing this game from being a solid 10 is the lack of music in the game - the ambient noise of the world is gorgeous, but I miss the orchestral backing of Twilight Princess.

SuperRockman,29-03-2017,"I have played about 12 hours of this of Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Wii U.
I will weight my review in 3 areas. Overall impression, Gameplay, and Graphics. I will not dock points for performance as mentioned above i played this game for Wii U. This is also 100% my opinion of the game based on my experience so far. i have not read a single review yet as i want to have the least biased review possible.

Overall Impressions:
The game starts off with a voice speaking to link. I was surprised that a Zelda game could finally have some sort of voice acting. It was also nice that the game doesnt force you into pointless tutorials, the game teaches as you play and become immersed in the world around you. after you leave the starting room, the title appears and introduces you to the massive world you will soon explore. Overall a decent start to the game. The starting section of the massive world however is linear at first with little to do except power through.

Overall 2/3

Graphics:
The look and atmosphere of BOTW is stunning, even on Wii U. The world seems to be alive. plants regrow, the textures look well designed and the sound track is incredible. Not much else to say here

3/3

Gameplay:
While it is refreshing to depart from the old Zelda formula, this does have its clear flaws. Alot of element of gameplay are simply borrowed from other games ex: Elder Scrolls, Far Cry, Assassins Creed. But what the game does barrow makes sense for an open world game. The Combat leaves much to be desired. I enjoy learning my enemies and figuring out how to use my weapons to win a combat, this quickly becomes tedious when constantly switching to different weapons when they break. Crafting is bare bones with little customization and some enemies can attack from what seems to be outside of the render distance. What first impressions i had and the appearance of the game makes up for lacks heavily in overall game play. i found looking for new weapons to be more of a chore. Perhaps the biggest drawback to the combat is the lack of rolling. Im not against changing the zelda formula, i welcome it, but removing such a useful game play mechanic made my experience suffer greatly. Just try to play any Dark Souls game without rolling at all. you cant. Links powers on the other hand are creative original and fun to experiment with. On a final note, WHERE DID THE DUNGEONS GO?????? its just simple and easy challenges like, 1 puzzle or 2 despite being hundreds of these locations in the game. this just seems like lazy game design to me.

1/4

Final Score 6/10

I enjoy this game, but it still leaves much to be desired. i have been a Zelda fan for years, and i praise all additions to the series. But i think there is a long way to go, i hope Nintendo can at the very least going forward(for a new zelda game), bring back the roll, fix the weapon degrade system and include ACTUAL DUNGEONS.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
funkjaw,26-04-2017,"Straight to the point: for a Zelda game, this deserves a 5. For an open world action RPG, it deserves an 7 - which is why I settled on a 6.

Nijayias,04-03-2017,"I think that I have put enough time since picking it up to review now. It's very rare that a game I feel so excited about managed to meet and even exceed my expectations. While the layout of buttons took some learning since actions were switched from what I'm used to, after two hours I think I can say that it really works. Many will claim that Ocarina of Time was the best Zelda game, I personally held Majora's Mask as my overall favorite and it got me addicted in a way only few games managed to. Breath of the Wild has achieved this very same feeling.

With the exception of larger ones, every tree can be damaged, cut down, climbed(all of them can with this), Every bit of grass serves as help for stealth or fire spread. Thunder Storms have a positive, negative and neutral affect. Hinders climbing, benefits stealth, can be an advantage or disadvantage to you or enemies who hold anything metal. There are so many little details in this game in so many areas that I don't have room to fit all of them in this limited review.

Now more than ever does Egorapter's sequelities on ocarina truly shine through with his criticisms that get addressed in this game and prove how much better Breath of the Wild is and stands over the best of the past. I feel like I'm actually in a wild where I have freedom which is on par or greater than how I felt about Skyrim, the sheer amount of combinations and options I have in traversing and combat truly excel this experience to a new bar for me. The Sheikah Slate really shines through with the abilities that it gives as tools you will frequently make use of in your own creative ways to solve puzzle and engage in combat. The game even makes me laugh like when I came across a bokoblin using a wooden Mop against me or another being picked up and hurled at me by a bigger enemy.

Cooking was something I almost never did in Skyrim and yet I find myself more engaged in it here as I feel Nintendo balanced all the survival elements so well. The fact I have died over and over while learning tells that this game is not the breeze that Ocarina of Time up to Skyward Sword could tend to e. I believe this is a game that I could still die on even after playing it for so long. What little issues like frame rate drops are almost complete insignificant to matter at all. This is my new favorite Zelda game and possible in my top 5 list of my favorite games of all time. Being Zelda gets it no bonus points here, Ignoring the title entirely and focusing on it as a game on it's own is what many would call a benchmark. Well done Nintendo. You recreated my Fond Memories of Majora's Mask all over again and bigger and better than it was before.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Cprens,03-03-2017,El juego es enorme. Tiene una jugabilidad grandiosa. La saga Zelda de por si tiene historias maravillosas y en ésta se sobró. Es algo nuevo para los fans de la saga un mundo abierta tan elaborado a pesar de que no tiene super gráficos y podría decir que en gráficos no compite con ninguna consola actual pero tiene una capacidad de sumergirte en ese mundo y de entretener que da miedo sin necesidad de grandiosos gráficos. En cuanto a jugabilidad es la mejor experiencia que he tenido solo comparable con GTA 5 sientes que puedes hacer de todo en ese mundo abierto.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
urmie,04-03-2017,"Here's where all the professional reviews are biased towards Nintendo. Apparently 720P/900P and frame rate drops are acceptable. This would never happen if the game was for PS4 and certainly not on the Xbox One. Is this game good? Yes. Is this the open world Zelda users have been clamoring for? Yes. Is it fun? Sure.
Is it 10/10? No, not in its current state, needs to be patched. If technical issues are faults for Sony and MS, then they should be for Nintendo as well.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Phantomik,05-03-2017,"A lot of Fun! Playing all free time,This is my 1st Zelda game and this is my first Nintendo. I am amazed, the world is NOT empty. It is filled with puzzled enemy encounters. Just an example - there is a tough enemy surrounded by easier mobs in the skeleton-head like cave in the very beginning. If you try to kill them all you'll probably end up ripped apart. You can sneak and kill 1 or 2 enemies but not all of them. You can see explosives inside the cave also but how to detonate them if you don't have any fire arrows? There are couple ways: there is a bonfire nearby and you can fire your arrows and shot the explosives or you can see a fire lamp right inside the cave and you can shot it down with regular arrows. There are so many different ways to accomplish the things and you feel extrimely satisfied when you find out the right way!

lqstuart,11-06-2021,"This game has similar or higher scores across the board than Red Dead Redemption 2, costs more (console included) than RDR2, and is a complete joke in comparison by every single metric. I think it's worth examining either the price of three-year-old Switch games (and the Switch console itself), or else the hilarious double standard to which Switch games are held.

In a vacuum, BOTW has a piss-poor soundtrack, washed out graphics, no story to speak of, and breakable weapons which make progression basically nonexistent no matter how long you suffer through it. In 2001, if all I could compare it to was GTA 3, I'd give it an 8 or 9 out of 10. In the 2020 market, with Genshin Impact doing all the stuff BOTW does better, without breakable weapons and for free, this game is crap and it boggles my mind how even the most devoted fanboy could give it above 6/10.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Rink,03-03-2017,"After a really long wait, Breath of the Wild is finally here and it really delivers. Actually more than just ""deliver"". This is a stunning game in every way. It's almost impossible to find any flaws in it. Everything, from the trailers to the concept art to actual game, just mesmerizes one. The best thing about this game is that it adds LOTS of new elements while retaining the traditional features of the Zelda seroes. The open world is really huge and offers almost unlimited exploration oppurtunities, the mechanics and game physics are to the point and cooking, the highlight of them all, brings out the inner creativity of every gamer. The graphics is unlike any other game I have played and gives the game a real edge. The story and soundtrack are superb, as with every other game of the series.

But nowadays every inch of feeling about that moment certainly start to vanish into the air and i was completely shocked when playing BOTW because that is exactly the feeling i have been looking for, the entire game is filled with wonder and magical moments that's rare in modern gaming industry. Zelda team decided to break all past Zelda convention surely resulting a huge impact as we can see on this game. The world have been created with heavy emphasize on interactivity, every single entity on Hyrule is breathing. This is textbook example of what we called MASTERPIECE.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

But i found this euphoric feeling while playing dissipate rapidly after a week.
Recommend it to Zelda fans as you will probably enjoy it, but as a massive Skyrim fan I feel as if this doesn't completely do it for me.

FPS drops

chenson87,17-03-2017,"Highly overrated. About the only thing good about it is its visual aesthetics and nostalgia.
Cons: weapon degradation system, forced motion controls that do not respond accurately, ""dungeons"" all look the same and dont offer much, heat/cold that keep you from exploring, weather elements that keep you from exploring, lack of tutorials for vital information needed the whole game, 1 hit kills, weapons that are high level but hit like paper mache, game encourages NOT engaging in battles, small cities with very little going on, dodge/block system regressed from Ocarina of Time instead of improving upon.

After having a great time with Horizon Zero Dawn, I expected so much more from BotW and was highly let down. It's a functional, sandbox sort of action/adventure with very little to actually do.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Despotism,07-03-2017,"This game is neither great or trash... it really is just meh... While I appreciate the graphic style I feel it just doesn't deserve any higher than a ""meh"" rating. Overall game play is ordinary and I played it for 2-3 hours to really make sure I was giving it a fair shake. But in the end I felt disappointed. Zelda is a legendary character with a TON of nostalgia behind it. Anyone giving it ultra high praise is really just playing on that feeling. If you love the game it's likely because you simply letting the flaws go because it's Zelda...

The game is laggy in spots, the game lacks all textures though they did this to save on frames I'm sure. Which is where this game really starts to give that false sense of being any good. It's cute in spots it really is, and the animation is fluid and well captured for sure, but simply lacks the processing power to be GREAT!

I'm returning my Switch because I personally feel ripped off. I only got it originally for Zelda making this one game the single most expensive game I've ever paid for $360... THAT is why I am giving it a mixed rating. It's not worth $360... NONE of the other games coming out look good enough to keep me from taking back the Switch. It's JUST NOT WORTH IT!

Think about all those user ratings that give it a 10... a 10! They paid $360 USD for a game that visually looks fresh, but in reality is about five years behind in technology, the whole console and the game is how much this game costs... This looks more like an Indie game from an Indie developer.

Sorry, can't give it any higher than a 5...",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I really hope Metacritic addresses all the 0s and 1s that Sony fans have been spamming because they're upset that this game scores a whole letter grade higher than HZD.

Tubey,04-03-2017,"It's absolutely outstanding. BotW offers the most beautifully designed open world yet seen in a video game, alongside clever mechanics (special shout out for how incredible the physics of this game are too), a very well woven story (almost passively told yet still deep and mesmerising) and a mild yet perfectly fitting soundtrack, all combining to produce one of the most complete, polished and instantly memorable video games of all time.

I'm no Nintendo fan boy at all - I think the company itself are quite horrible with their YouTube policies, attempt to strangle video game rentals decades ago (along with Action Replay cheat carts) - but despite all of that, they put out astonishing games, and honestly this one might just be their crowning achievement ever.

Yes, I'm talking about one-upping classics like Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Mario 64, Super Metroid... the lot. Breath of the Wild is the culmination of decades of experience from a company who may have just perfected single player gaming with one single masterpiece.

I won't write much more, as I want to avoid spoilers completely - this game should be played blind and you should indulge yourself in it. Honestly, do what I'm going to do - put every other game on the backburner and enjoy this for the next month or so. It deserves your time and attention.

Well done Nintendo - I still loathe what you are, but well done indeed. With one launch title, they've already gave Switch owners value for money.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

yumegiwa,04-03-2017,"This is a pretty solid open world game and it does things that a lot of other open worlds do not.

This game really changes up the Zelda franchise and opens up many new gameplay opportunities, however at the same time it makes me miss aspects of previous Zelda games, like how spoils from side quests used to actually be meaningful (heart pieces, upgrades etc) whereas they're mostly temporary disposable items in this game.

Ironically, previous Zelda titles actually feel like a bigger experience compared to Breath of the Wild due to the greater focus on story and scripted events.

Pros:
- The interactiveness of the environment makes the world feel more real that most rpgs: cutting down a tree to cross a gap in a cliff; shooting an arrow through fire to make it a flaming arrow and set a grassy field ablaze; animals act natural; etc.
- The enemy AI is smart (in most cases) which makes battles fun.
- Most of the puzzles are entertaining.

Cons:
- Lack of direction in some of the shrine puzzles which gives you those ""wtf am I supposed to do moments"".
- While the difficult battles are fun, some situations and enemy placements are really cheap and make for a frustrating experience.
- Most of the story is told through flashbacks rather than playing through the story as in previous games. This cheapens the overall story experience.
- The voice acting sucks.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheRamosOnline,12-03-2017,"The best Zelda game ever released by Nintendo, without a doubt.
After beating the game the first time, the Sheika Slake's map will display a percentage, and boy will this show you how truly massive the game is. I was only 17.26% done at the time of defeating the final boss!
With 120 shrines, 900 Koroks and I have no idea how many side quests, this game will keep you busy for ages!

A few negatives include a frame rate chug when in docked 1080p mode. This can be solved by either forcing the TV Mode to 720p, but if you don't want to sacrifice crisp HD visuals then you'll have to make do with the chugging. It doesn't negatively impact the gameplay, but it can be bothersome to some.
The graphics leave a lot to be desired, but they'll age well like Wind Waker did.

Music - 7/10
Ambient is the word best used to describe the music. Don't expect epic themes as you ride through Hyrule. Light ambient tunes based on previous Zelda melodies grace recurring areas, such as Zora's Domain and Goron City.

Graphics - 6/10
Don't get me wrong, the character models look amazing and the landscape is breathtaking. But at a distance, you'll see where corners were cut, as distant objects become super low poly to make it easier for the console to render. And don't think things get better up close, as many mountain textures are pretty low pixel too. But the lightning is rich, the dynamic grass is some of the best seen on a console and the art style is sure to age well.

Gameplay - 10/10
This is where Breath of the Wild shines. The world is truly open, and once you're off of the Great Plateau the options are endless!
If you see it, you can go there! You're not playing a Paint By Numbers Zelda game like Ocarina of Time, the game doesn't hold your hand as it guides you through various mechanics. You're just thrust into the game and left to your own discoveries. It feels like a true survival game, no two players will have the same experience.
Will you experiment with the controls and world around you, or will you uncover secrets and mechanics by pure chance? The kind of person you are will dictate the kind of experience you have playing Breath of the Wild.
Patient players will find themselves sneaking around enemy camps and picking foes off one by one as they scramble to figure out what's going on.
Reckless players will charge in, woefully unequipped and somehow come out alive, reaping the rewards of battle a little quicker than the patient players, but worse for ware.
The game is truly open.
While there's no confirmation on this, it seems the monster AI actually learns too. You may find yourself trying the ""Bomb and Run"" tactic only to find a monster kick your bomb back at you once it's been hit by this tactic a few times.

This GAME is a straight 10/10.

Moby1985,06-03-2017,"Zelda Breath Of The Wild (BOTW) is a great game and a worthy entrant in the Zelda series. It seems like it's a new fresh idea but it's actually the opposite: it brings the game before the Ocarina of Time template and back to the idea of the very first game. Exploring here, there, digging up content and experimenting.

PROS
-Excellent, expansive world begging to explore and you'll probably spend much more time doing that then the main quest.
-Dungeons and mechanics are great
-Good art style
-Oozes effort, care, and craft.

Cons:
-Believe the frame rate drop comments on other reviews, they are real, distracting, and at times - severe (disclosure: I only have the Wii U version).
-Music is a disappointment which Zelda admittedly has set a very high bar (loss of the in-house melody is quite missed).

In truth I think the game deserves an ""8"" but the technical issues become somewhat dulled with just how much FUN the game is and how much content you get.

TarikVaine,08-03-2017,"This might be one of the best games that I've ever played. It's a timeless gem and gave me a feeling I just had with a very few games in my life (Maniac Mansion, Prince of Persia 2 [DOS], Ultima Online).
The world is so alive that the biggest competition in this game is to follow the main quest. Instead you'll find yourself fooling around in the world for hours until you remember that there was a place you needed to go to.
Sure, that's something that every open world game is aiming for and a few of them succeeded but not a single one of them did it so well as The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
Yes, it got some frame rate drops and yes, not everyone likes the fact that all weapons are just temporary as they will break sooner or later (and I hate that my weapons break, really) but the fact that I give a 10 out of 10 rating for this nonetheless might give you an insight at how great this game really is.
No matter which genres you prefer, no matter if you even like the Zelda series, you HAVE to play this game. It should be on the to do list of every gamer.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kronos662,08-03-2017,"The Legend Of Zelda Breath of the Wild es lo mejor que han creado, cada minuto que pasas en el Juego es realmente increíble, sus hermosos paisajes, su historia todo esta hermoso :)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mattyjay11,08-03-2017,"This game is amazing, massive step up for Zelda and Nintendo, true open world with very little hand holding and a solid Zelda story. I really like that there in no order you are required to do things in because all your core abilities are given to you within the first 30 mins, to me this game is the only reason I bought a Switch, I'm like 40 hours in and still have stuff to do. If you are a fun of Zelda, you really need to play this game. Don't buy into the hate train, this game is near perfect and surprisingly challenging.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Smozeley,08-03-2017,"This Zelda game defied all expectations. The art style is beautiful and there are so many stunning views available due to Links ability to climb almost anywhere you can see. Right out of the gate youre given everything you need to explore the world and take the game as you please. This game sprinkles puzzles everywhere instead of simply placing them in the dungeons. This brings one of Zelda's best aspects (puzzel solving) to the forefront of the entire game instead of dredging through tedious tasks in a race to get to the next dungeon. I often find it hard to complete my tasks quickly as the world is just so delightfully distracting and fun to explore.

The new weapon system was a big bummer at first but it quickly became a non-factor as you constantly find newer and cooler weapons. In fact, I often have to discard a weapon from my inventory just to pick it up. I see many people complaining about the lack of ""unique items"" like the hookshot and so forth that are unique to solving a dungeon or allowing access to a new area. To me this was always one of the worst aspects of the Zelda series: locking you into a narrow path that can only be traversed via a *conveniently* placed item. Had the baddies only removed that item from the dungeon they had taken complete control of, you'd never be able to beat it - plot hole much? Not to mention you find WAY more unique weapons, shields, and other items throughout Breath of the Wild than all the other Zelda games combined. Do you really care that you don't get silly items that you use for 1 or 2 areas and generally don't need to use again? The old way made navigation through the world about what you couldn't do yet and having to come back when you can, the new way makes it so you can practically go anywhere and do anything as long as you can figure out the puzzle of how to do it - and that's why simply exploring is just so dang fun.

The additional RPG elements are a great bonus. Crafting, upgrades, and cooking add a new layer to the game that creates additional goals and purpose to exploring every nook and crazy of the beautifully crafted world.

This is without a doubt the best Zelda game ever made. It is a revolutionary change to the formula, one to rival the greatness of Ocarina of Time when it first broke the mold of the ""traditional"" Zelda games before it. Like Ocarina of Time, Breath of the Wild has those who will kick and scream at the changes, but history will show this game as the start of the new golden Era in the Zelda series just as OOT had done so many years ago.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ThaDudeMan,25-04-2017,"Has anyone who gave this game a 10/10 ever played inquisition? if not, go play that and edit your score, because i believe most zelda fans never played an open world game before, this game is cryptic, boring, looks dull after the first couple hours, is tedious, and progression is slow, leading most people ive talked to to have stopped playing the game half way through due to lack of progression, all in all where a game like inquisition kept my attention the whole way through with good progression, this game gets boring fast and farming gets annoying as progression is slowed to a crawl at some points",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ooo77,10-07-2017,"This game is overrated beyond belief, them changing the Zelda formula was a bad move and I hope when the next one comes they go back to it.

Nightbreedgamin,27-04-2017,While no doubt beautiful the legend of zelda breath of the wild is receiving to much credit for what it actually is. Overrated. It brings nothing new we haven't already scene from superior games like Skyrim and The Witcher 3. Weapons break all the time making them borderline useless. Also the open world of Hyrule is surprisingly empty for a open world of it's size. Games like Watch Dog's 2 were not as large but still had more content and several stories at once. Also in this new Zelda game we have no iconic music and terrible voice acting. Also when can we get a villain that actually claims a victory or two? Ganon is getting pitiful. This game does not deserve a perfect score due to it's flaws but anyone who gives it under an average score is obviously a hater.,6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Daniel_Campbell,07-03-2017,"Truly a breathtaking game. It's not perfect, but it's close enough.

Seriously, this game is amazing. In most open world games when you ""climb the tower"" you're inundated with icons that flood the map. In Zelda, it's up to you to chart your path. In so many games they tell you to look to the horizon and say, ""See that mountain, you can go there"". In Zelda that means something so much more than how far you can go. You don't have to follow a specific path, you don't have to take the road some designer had laid out for you. It's up to YOU how and when you get there. What's more amazing is how the game rewards exploration. On your way to ""The Mountain"" you may see a valley, a flag pole, a shack, an adventure. Nintendo has proven with Zelda that the old saying, “It's not the destination, it's the journey” is true. My story of going to Death Mountain will be different from yours. The horse you tamed, the shrines you visit and the enemies you've slain will all feel different. Different, yet no less impactful than my journey was to me. To anyone hating on this game, I truly feel pity for them that they found themselves incapable of enjoying this masterpiece of game making. For the rest of us though, go. Go on YOUR adventure, and enjoy climbing YOUR mountain.

Cons:
Forced Motion Control
Raining puts a Damper on climbing. Get it? ""Damp(er)? DO YOU GET IT?!?!
May be too difficult for some folks
Some won't like weapon durability

Pros:
Everything else",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
T3CHNINJ4,09-03-2017,"The game is all about discovery and exploration. Everything in the game is polished and you can tell that the developers have thought about everything in the game from the physics of rocks rolling down hills, to freaking bombs rolling back to you if the wind is blowing harder in a plain between the mountains! Story driven but your adventure takes you wherever you want. Combat is simple but AI gets a bit smarter as you get farther in. Play the game and figure out the score for yourself.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ivan665,14-03-2017,"I give this game a 10 to balance things out. It seems there are alot of haters that give it low scores, because they dont have a Nintendo console. I havent played it yet myself, because the Nintendo Switch is a rushed hardware, a beta. Im sure by black friday Nintendo will get it fixed and offer the game in a bundle. Anyway Ive watched 2-3 long gameplay videos, and the game is fantastic! Its an adventure openworld sandbox explorers game, not so much of an action, it has more adventure with sandbox and some fighting, overall it has great gameplay. Its unfair to downvote it just because its not available on PC, PS4 or Xgone. While I agree the Switch is unfinished, and can get fried if you play Skyrim while docked right now, BUT the game has nothing to do with it. Its just a seperate product. I have a NES and a Gameboy, which thoughout their long lives have been kept in a basement in my hometown, which i visited recently. I found them, and the little mothef****s still work like charm! The Switch is Early Access, thats simply how the game industry IS today! ... mainly because of the zombie player masses who approve this business model. So Nintendo are simply adapting and reacting to the market like everyone else. They will fix it in a next revision, they simply know how to do it. So why hate them? Hate the zombies. The game is great because of the gameplay and its only single player, which is a huge bonus that is rarely seen today. Just compare Zelda BOTW to online games full of facebook kids, with mixed perceptions about virtual ego and real life, who rush to die, curse and report you, and ragequit. The sort of games like WoW, LoL, Dota 2, CS, TF2, Overwatch, etc. etc,, even SC2, basically most of the PC games nowdays. Thats why I stopped playing online games at all, because for the most part it just feels like babysitting and motivating the little zombies with the polished brains, instead of actually playing the game. I had no console after NES and PS2, I played multiplayer games on PC during their golden age, before pay to win, before everyone had easy access to these games, before they got filled with litlle zombies. This golden age of PC online games is well over now, since those type of games became completely indiscriminating to players IQ, in the name of profit. I have no nostalgia about anything Im totally in the now, I only care about the best available game experiences right now. Sure, I would like a Quake 2 deathmatch, or a Broodwar free for all in the LAN club, or a vanilla WoW boss raid, but hey man, they dont happen anymore. What was, was. Today we have online servers full of coplexed kids. This is why I have gone single player only, and why I will buy a Switch and enjoy the Zelda BOTW, because its a real game, a great game, no matter how the brainwashed masses rate it. And this is why games like Zelda BOTW, will always be so sought after, so special for the real gamer. Naturally the game deserves a 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

GAMERGUY25,31-03-2017,"After years of waiting from E3 teasers and delays The legend of zelda breath of the wild is finally here and my goodness it is a masterpiece. Link starts the adventure waking up from a 100 year sleep guided by a voice telling him to wake up and yes a voice a first to the series some of the important characters have voices. He grabs some clothes form a chest and walks out to the world and you get a stunning view of hyrule and it is breathtaking. After this cutscene you can freely explore the plateau climb swim and run through collecting weapons and defeating enemies I wish I could describe it any other way but this game has so much freedom you are instructed to do 4 shrines and acquire the paraglider to leave the plateau and explore the main world. But like I stated before there is so much freedom you can fight the final boss right then and there if you wish but you will obviously be at a severe disadvantage. The graphics are top notch and the art style really makes the colors pop. The music is not the zelda norm no more grand themes across hyrule field the main sound you hear are the sounds of nature water wind and animals when music does play it is of a quiet piano or flute which fits the setting of the game perfectly. Gameplay is fantastic there are a ton of different weapons and armor that play and look great however weapons have a durability and break after a while so make sure you stock up on weapons. It is crazy how alive and realistic this game is. people in villages have daily routines like walking to work tending to plants or kids playing with their friends, as rain starts falling people will start to run inside as it rains rocks are harder to climb due to the wet rocks and lighting strikes metallic objects enemies run and pick up weapons off the ground when theirs is lost and use the environment very well like tossing barrels and using fire and more.

Exquis,07-03-2017,"Review below the rant.
The amount of fake user reviews is astounding, people that can't tell the difference between Link and Zelda, claim that you're forced to use Links classic green outfit (That he doesn't even possess baseline in BOTW), have obviously never even touched this game or the franchise in general. Polluting review sites because of your childish fanboy war is f*ing pathetic. Anything below 5 is just being salty or fanboy-warfare, giving it a 10/10 is fanboyism, strictly due to performance issues. No game with optimization this horrible can be worthy of a 10/10, sorry.

Now then, as a pc/ps/xbox/Nintendo player, Zelda: botw's gameplay is solid, the game looks great, combat feels good, and there's lots and lots of stuff to do. I completely lost track of time the first 3 days i spent playing this game, it completely absorbed me in a way no game has since i was but a child playing on the n64/ps2 etc.

The only real complaints i have is the lack of a more well developed story and the performance issues, the story is bland and not very interesting. When the memory-flashbacks of link feel more rewarding and interesting than the actual present story progression: something is off.
For a game that was developed for the previous AND upcoming gen console, the performance is completely and utterly garbage. There's no way to justify fps drops to around 15-20, no way whatsoever.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
peropify,07-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is one of the first open world games that I can sit down and play for hours on end without getting dull. There is just so much content at every corner, the puzzles are interesting and just complex enough not to make you want to put down the game, the mechanics in every aspect of the game are superb (you train a horse almost how you normally would in real life), it doesn't hold your hand every step of the way. People that give this a low rating either complain about the genre style of the game that doesn't match their tastes or complain about the enemy variety. There are minor problems with the enemy AI (like them getting stuck on a pole), but the various small intricacies and level of variety available are staggering, not to mention the amount of ways to defeat them are almost endless (Blowing up nearby explosive barrel at an enemy camp, no explosive barrel? Roll a huge boulder over their heads. No huge boulder? Light the tall grass theyre sitting in on fire. Raining? Tie a bomb onto an octoballon to float in the air, blow it above their camp using a leaf you found while chopping down a tree, pop the ballon with an arrow and detonate.)

The game world is just huge and amazing. It really does make you WANT to go explore that mountain you can barely see on the other side of the map. In a lot of games it feels like that mountain would just be there to exist, but in BOTW it feels like there is a reason to want to go there.

My main criticism would be that inventory management can be a hassle as you get more and more items. I would be much happier if I could use ZR/ZL to move between inventory page typesrather than having to move through every single page to find what I'm looking for.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild ImageI'm in awe of the vast World Nintendo has managed to create. 4 constant days of playing and I've barely scratched the surface, If you liked Skyrim, then consider this the next instalment. There are details in every corner, and always something to do. The world is alive with animals, insects, music and roaming NPCs. The linearity and forced concepts of any previous Zelda games are gone, but if you search you'll find the old gems are probably in there somewhere. The inventory and gear system makes the game feel fun to play, and not tedious like ingredient collecting in Skyrim and reparations in Minecraft (armor is indestructible). The combat can feel akin to Dark Souls at times, as some tougher enemies do loads of damage, but if you stock up enough food items you can tank quite a few hits, which is not welcome to some. Most of the time, tougher enemies can one-hit you though. All in all this is a game I will most likely be playing for months and keep loving it. I can't wait to see what other games Nintendo has in store for the rest of the year!

Also, please mind the trolls casting negative votes. Sound, graphics, and mechanics are excellent, and story is so far captivating. There are frame stuttering in certain places when graphical effects overlap, but most of the time it runs perfectly (like during explosions and combat). If you get the game and like exploring, challenging combat, and a sense of beauty, you won't be disappointed.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

However, if you can look past a few technical problems (including framerate dips), you might just find an absolutely incredible game.
The Great Plateau portion of the game is a little bland, however, once you get past it, the possibilities are endless. I cannot tell you how much fun I've had with this game, it is impossible to describe. You owe it to yourself to check it out and find out for yourself how fun it really is.

I have yet to fully dive into the story, and for the most part have enjoyed running around exploring the beautiful world and tackling shrines. The game is harder than other Zelda games in the series, but your deaths don't feel cheated at all.

Schnapfel,18-04-2017,"This game is amazing. And what i mean is that it literally amazed me from time to time. The graphics, the musics, the world design, it is just better than you could hope for. I did not play too many games over the last 10 years and I am definitely not into open world games, but this felt awsome. When I started the game I had some things in my mind I wanted to do. When I reached some placed it summed up to like 10 things I had in my mind. This is how open world should be. You acknowledge what is possible and do whatever you want. This game is just pure art.

Let's come to the negativities.
First of all, the frame rate. Most of the time it runs perfectly. At some points it had minor frame drops. I only encountered really annoying drops in the starting area and the Lost Woods. Most important for me is that they never occured at points with high need of control, like big enemy camps or boss fights.
Second is the weapon breaking system. I understand and appreciate it, but it is really annoying that even the endgame weapons break really fast, even some of the unique ones, and -without spoiling too much- it takes some work to replace them.
Third is the lack of dungeons. There are no real dungeons in this game as those you are used to playing Zelda. But to be fair this is no real issue. It is something you might expect in a Zelda game, but it is nothing to objectively criticize a standalone game. The game itself is complete and does not lack gameplay at any time.

Objectively only having those 2 minor critique points and having so much fun with this game and being overwhelmed by some of the innovation it has to offer, I have to call it a masterpiece and give it -and it is a struggle for me to do so- a perfect score of 10.

And if you are still thinking about whether you should buy this game or not, you should definitely check out those mixed reviews it got. But I can assure you that every review with a rating of lower than 6 is total nonsense and can definitely be ignored by you.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hrboe,13-03-2017,"I love this game. Is it perfect? No, but its the closest thing to ""perfect"" any game of this genre has come. It's gorgeous, it's massive, it's full of life and secrets and those little touches that define ""Nintendo polish"". I can't tell you how many times I've had my jaw drop at something I accidentally stumbled upon and just went ""what is that? WHAT IS THAT?!?"" It's probably been over half a decade since I've felt so addicted to a game. While I would have liked more character development for the four champions, Zelda herself is more well-developed than any character in any of the previous Zelda games. Nintendo really made an amazing character with her. She's multidimensional, she has multiple character arcs, and it's all presented in such a creative way. They even give Link some character development, in a way. You would think that giving Link personality would ruin the character, since he's supposed to be the silent, ""blank slate"" protagonist that people project themselves onto. But once again, it's done so smartly that it does wonders for the character's likability. All-in-all, an absolutely amazing game.

I look forward to seeing how Nintendo tries to top this one.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dburger10,13-03-2017,"Being a long time Zelda fan has given me a good sense of the ""Zelda formula"". When a new Zelda game comes out, I come to expect that there will be a forest, fire, and water temple and then there is a plot twist. With breath of the wild, I had to throw the formula I knew out the the window, this game changes everything. That being said this game still feels like Zelda with lots of puzzles and a challenging to master combat system. I could most compare this to ""The legend of Zelda"" for the NES. This game shows the real meaning of ""Open World"". You do not have to do things in a specific order, you can even go straight to the final boss of the game right when leave the ""tutorial"" area. This may be possible but is not wise as you are at a complete disadvantage. Different parts of the world have different effects on you, for example walking up the path to death mountain will punish you if you do not have the right supplies. The game teaches you to solve your puzzles by finding your own way to solve them. In my example, you may want to create an elixir through the games simple but intresting cooking system. You are not forced to follow a linear path and in the meantime you can explore in free roam. You can do whatever you want, when you want. This game houses a stunning world the is an achievement on its own. I found myself enjoying the world more than the story, not to say the story is not good but its not the reason to buy this game. This game is a reason to buy the Nintendo Switch if you can get your hands on one. If not then get it on WiiU, from what I have heard, nothing has changed from the Switch version in terms of story. This game may not be my favourite Zelda game in the series but it deserves the praise it gets. It shows the gaming industry that an amazing game does not need amazing graphics or a giant multiplayer fan base to great. Nintendo has done it again winning millions of fans over with this marvelous title and is an essential game to be in any gamer's library. Get this game!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
CalebHab,15-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is the fullest, biggest, most interesting Zelda game to date. It has an amazing sense of scale and excitement. Its art style fits the open world perfectly, and the Zelda universe. If you haven't played it yet, it is a must own.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
eradication,16-03-2017,"I would Give it a 9.9 out of 10 since that is not possible here I did round it up.

I played every genre and almost all important games. I play mostely on PC but I do like some games on console more. But this game... ohohoh it sounds kinda fanboy-ish but this is the best game ive ever played BUT its not perfect...

Ill start with the cons, cause there are only a few of them.

Cons:
- The music really fits good but im more of a fan of more melody in my music, like the older LoZ games.
- I wish there was a post Ganon game or some kind of NewGamePlus. Im still okay the way it is.
- the 30fps thing... but I understand its on such a small hardware so I totally agree with it.

Pros:
Well well well, there is so much to say here:
- The great plateau is a great way to prepare the player for the open world
- The game is polished to oblivion, Its incredible how much detail went into the game
- The weapon system ist fast, dynamic and intuitive
- All shiekah modules are used throughout the game for all bosses/shrines/dungeons and fighting
- Looting feels very satisfying
- The artdesign is the best so far, they went the middle way between Twinlight Princess and Windwaker
- charakters, sound, enemies, landscape, bosses are all beautiful designed and animated
- the controlls feels a bit wonky at the beginning since Zelda fans are different play style, but after some hours im totally okay with it. I love it the way it is.

Weslapootayn,28-06-2017,"I can't for the life of me figure out how this game is a 10/10 to so many people...

This game is not worth investing any more time in than the time it takes to complete the main quests and beat the game. There's nothing cool or interesting to find off the beaten path in this game, and if you go looking for something cool or interesting you'll be let down over and over again.

It makes absolutely no sense at all that Skyrim is rated lower on Metacritic than Breath of the Wild when Skyrim offers so much more. Skyrim is packed with quests to do, things to craft, dungeons to plunder, dragons to fight, skills, perks, magic, and more. Skyrim also has several cities that are pretty much all bigger than any and every town in Breath of the Wild and more interesting to boot. It blows my mind that Breath of the Wild not only gets a pass for being devoid of content, but gets 10's almost exclusively. I only really think two things about Breath of the Wild are great, and that's the shrines and the player progression.

When I first played this game I loved that you don't level up, and instead progress as a player through finding better armor and weapons. That's a concept that you don't see very often in modern open world RPG's, and I love it because it makes the treasure you find have more of an impact on your strength. This also completely removes the need to grind for levels which is a godsend.. Nobody likes grinding. As much as I prefer this way of progressing as a player in an RPG they still managed to screw it up.. The concept of only becoming stronger through finding weapons and armor is only cool if there is a lot of weapons and armor to find. In Breath of the Wild there is a good amount of weapons, but the armor is pitiful. Most of the armor is only good to protect you against the elements, and nothing else. There is only one type of armor that gives you a combat boost or any helpful boost at all. You don't feel like you progress that much as a character because there's no leveling up and there's very little armor to find. There is a decent amount of weapons in this game, but the weapons are leveled which ruins a lot of exploration. In a game about exploration you should be able to find something amazing right from the getgo. It should be hard to actually get, but it should be attainable at any point. Leveling the weapons to whatever metric Nintendo used for your skill level defeats the point of going off to a strange place looking for good loot. You'll always find what the game wants you to find. Where's the fun in that? Without interesting weapons or armor to find you'd think the quests would fill in this lack of fun and satisfaction with exploring. Nope.

There are only a handful of main quests to do in this game, and that's fine because those main quests are fun and engaging enough. The problem is with the side quests. There is a severe lack of quantity and quality in the side quests of this game. A game with unrewarding exploration and only a few main quests you'd expect the side quests to fill in the rest but they just don't. There aren't that many of them and the ones you do get are mostly ""go here and bring me 10 of these"" quests. I guess there aren't many side quests simply because there just aren't very many people in this game though. That's another problem. There's about 5 towns in this game and they're all tiny. There's not much to do in them, people to talk to, or quests to do so they're mostly pointless. It's sad that this game set in a huge world in 2017 has villages so tiny that they might all collectively fit into Solitude in Skyrim.

Generally speaking this game is a HUGE open world with hardly anything in it. It's a pathetic game to give 10's to. Skyrim does almost everything better than Breath of the Wild, but what it mostly does better is having actual THINGS TO DO and a smaller world with less pointless space. Seriously everyone must have rated this game a 10 after playing it for 10 hours or less. This is the most empty and boring game to ever get this high of a rating. The atmosphere is great, the climbing and gliding is great for exploration, I love the shrines although they're way too short, and the divine beasts were fun if just a little too easy. It's not a bad game, it's just not a great game either.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
IEatBabies,01-10-2017,"I wanna start off by saying that the game is beautiful. Even for a Wii u port. The simplistic colorgasm and just sheer size was overwhelming and definitely triggered my adhd in wanting to go there see that. I always felt like I was exploring some place that had character and life. Clearly every part of the world had a reason for being there and in a climate where open world games are usually cookie cutter cut and paste asset here it's nice to see a world where there's a world there. Like a dev individually took the time to craft something in every place you look at. Albeit there is sometimes too much open plains or fields of nothing but that is few and far between. I loved when I was exploring early on and found a lynel that immediately raped me and I went nope.jpg. Finding stone talus and hiroxes of all shapes and colors (Even an undead one). Landmarks that turned out to hidden puzzles or whatever that contained korok seeds. The freedom of climbing **** anything and paragliding down to whatever interesting thing you see. Getting your first horse, then second, then third, and Epona. Sand sealing, using boats, and shield surfing?! All these neat ways to move faster and explore better in this world which is so massive and at times breathtaking.

But empty. Beyond fighting (Which becomes unnecessary beyond needing to farm for mats), finding korok seeds, and shrines. The world is empty. There's nothing there. Nothing to really do. Exploring is fun but the novelty will wear off and once you've explored an area that's it. And when you've done enough exploring in general you're never really surprised by anything anymore because it's the same old thing being done just a little differently. You've done everything there is to do in that area. There's no real reason to ever go back aside from finding missed shrines or korok seeds. Side quests are basic as **** too so they don't really provide any incentive to go back to those areas and talk to people because the quests are always ""go there do this fight that and bring me this."" Nothing inherently fun or interesting about side quests so far. Not a single **** one has been fun. Literally no reason to continue exploring or being thorough in an area you already explored. Oh I guess you could go back repeatedly to get a certain food (looking at you hearty durian).

Next is the shrines. **** shrines. This is where I'm just triggered the hardest. Look I'm just a normie casual peruser of game media and mechanics. I'm not a **** GAME DEVELOPER. But even a **** normie like me can tell when the game developers clearly put no **** thought into something and nowhere is that more clear than with shrines. Shrine ""puzzles"" if you can even call them puzzles are never hard, challenging, or even fun. Usually they're simple to solve and even if they incorporate a neat mechanic or design choice like a game developer actually took the time to craft a fun and engaging puzzle . . . The puzzle is over. Woah you need to put a bomb on top and underneath to break the rocks on top? Cool what's next shrine aaaand it's over. What's this? I have to fight a guardian as a shrine? Again? Again? AGAIN? AGAIN BUT NOW IT'S EASIER CUZ I CAN USE MAGNESIS OR CRYONIS TO MAKE A PILLAR? Woah this puzzle to get into the shrine is actually fun and challenging finally some good game design aaaaand the shrine is a straight path and that's it. I found a shrine randomly in the wild aaaand no puzzle just a straight shot to a chest and an orb. Aside from combat shrines there's not really ""tiers of difficulties"" with shrines. They're all pretty easy.

And can I say that the orbs are stupid as **** and a waste of time. Can you just let me have a piece of heart or stamina on the spot inside of shrines instead of dealing with this stupid statue?

Combat. . . Let me start this section off by saying that combat can be fun. Using bullet time or arrow time while paragliding above a and finishing it up with a down smash attack is satisfying and fun. But the terrible lock on camera and not having a dedicated dodge button is not. Why couldn't my sprint button be a sprint if I held it down and a dodge if I tapped it like in dark souls? Why is the flurry activated so easily with no real sense of timing or skill needed? You could be out of the way of an attack entirely and take no damage if the attack animation goes through but if you hit the dodge button your flurry activates anyway? WHY? And for such a huge world why are bokoblins, moblins, and lizalfos pretty much 95% of what you'll be fighting? This game needs waaaaaay more enemy variety. Even with minibosses and bosses I'm disappointed. Lynels excluded (which I'm sad isn't a named boss with a health bar at the top) all the bosses hiroxes and its variance, stone talks, and moldugas are easy as **** to kill or just straight up boring to do.

I could keep going but I'm running out of characters :'^]",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ryuujin,19-10-2017,"My friend gave me his wii u to play this so I don't have to buy a switch, and in all honesty I'm really glad that he did. The game is very good and has a solid start, but after playing it for about 10 hours the monotony really sets in. This could just be because the game is severely over hyped or the fact that the world is pretty barren but the game is underwhelming and there isn't a lot of things to do. Yes there are a lot of shrines and the korok seeds but there is really no point in getting all of them. One thing that sets this game apart from other open world games is that it isn't just crossing things off a list to collect, or at least that's what many other reviewers have said but that isn't necessarily the case, it's just that there isn't as many types of things to collect.

Stika999,01-08-2021,"97 on Metacritic. ""Universal Acclaim"". I honestly can't believe this, I'm baffled and speechless. This is hands down the most overrated game of the last decade.

BOTW's premise is alluring. A seemingly endless, lush natural environment to explore as you please, with a credible physics model to support your adventures and encourage you to find creative ways to overcome obstacles. What could possibly go wrong?

The first thing you do in this game is climbing on a tall tower, from which you can spot points of interest around you. The next thing you do is getting the paraglider, that allows you to glide towards these points of interest. This is what the game openly encourages you to do. unfortunately this premise is constantly contradicted. You get to a tower you've seen from a distance - possibly after about 30 minutes of wandering and climbing - only to find out you can't swim across the very last puddle of mud before the tower. You make your way to a shrine, only to find out it's surrounded by thorns and you've been travelling all the way there for nothing. In this free roaming game there's far too much you can't do from the beginning, and it's disheartening to find out that in this massive region there's just 2 or 3 places that you can actually go to. There's also situations where you're arbitrarily denied to glide towards certain areas (the lost woods, the divine beasts aiming at hyrule castle) and just taken back to where you first jumped from, very rough game design choice for a 2017 AAA game that ends up getting 97 on metacritic. BOTW is a game that systematically and constantly frustrates the gamer's curiosity and efforts, that regularly tells ""NO"" to the player.

Do you want to pick up the sword? NO, your ridiculously small pockets are full already. Do you want to put a pin on a shrine you've spotted from hyrule castle? NO, you can't. (god knows why). Do you want to drop bananas on the floor, as you're crouching in this dungeon where you're required to crouch and leave bananas on the floor? NO, you have to stand before dropping the bananas, otherwise they'll disappear because hey, it's Zelda and everyone's going to say it's great anyway. Wow.

Combat's, well, useless. There's obviously an issue with weapon's durability - wether you're wielding a tree branch or a royal claymore, you'll soon see a ""your weapon is about to break"" message, that paired with the ""you can't carry any more weapons"" message will - should, at least - make you wonder if nintendo wanted you to have any fun at all playing this game. But combat's also useless because there's no real gain to be had from winning, no rupee drops, just a bunch of ingredients - always the same, over and over again - that you can then use to brew elixirs, which again won't change anything for more than a few minutes.

I could go on but i'll stop here. Aside from a couple well designed shrines and a few potentially exciting moments (based on wild plagiarisms from shadow of the colossus anyway) i didn't have a single minute of fun in the 50 hours i've spent on hyrule. Instead, i was constantly denied entertainment by incredibly dull game design choices, the most awkward controls and menus i've seen in years and ridiculous inventory limitations, that seemed genuinely designed to irritate the player. Well, mission accomplished Nintendo!

Honelith,05-03-2017,"Embrace the joy of gaming, Breath of the Wild is a gaming jewel which gets so many things right and several not so good, but on the grand scale of things, a game of this depth and breadth is an amazing achievement. It's up there with The Witcher 3 and The Elder Scrolls, but it's a very unique take on open world exploration which makes Breath of the Wild very interesting, it's an absolute joy to play which The Witcher 3 and The Elder Scrolls games simply cannot tap into.

Quite possibly the most fun I've had with a game in many, many years. My biggest issue was 900p resolution and sub 30fps, but the art style is beautiful and the gameworld is full of life that you hardly take notice, so don't let that put you off.

Lonewulfza,10-03-2017,"I have roughly about 30 hours of play time on the new Zelda BotW on Switch. And I am confident to say that it is one of the best games I have EVER played. The dynamicness of the physics engine and the massive open world brings Zelda to life as I have personally never experienced it before and I was a big fan of Ocarina of Time.
Zelda BotW is a game that every self proclaimed gamer needs to experience to see what a open world game SHOULD be like.

The best thing about Zelda BotW is the fact that it does not hold your hand. You need to investigate and try things to figure them out. Questions like 'if I hold this wooden spear in the fire, will it catch alight?' and 'If the bokoblins throw rocks at me, can I hit the rocks back at them with a wooden club?' are where the joy of trail and error lay. It truly is a fantastic experience. I will be playing this game for a long, long time.

Some of the only critics I can give it:

One is that the story takes a back seat for the most part in the early game. It tries to make it look like there is this impending danger, but it never really comes across like that when you are exploring the open world, staying away from any main story missions.

Another is that some of the voice acting (a new for Zelda games) is pretty terrible. You get the just of what the story is trying to tell you, but the audio of the few voice acted scenes sometimes dips softer for no apparent reason.

In the end, those complaints are tiny against the overwhelming number of positives that you will experience from playing this iteration of the legend of Zelda.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Subject98,24-07-2020,"At first it seemed very promising, and they got pretty much all of the gameplay mechanics down very well, but after several dozen hours of playing it I came away feeling like this is just good ground work laid down for an even better game in the future.

I've heard so much about how this is the best open world game and that it fixes all of the problems that have plagued the genre for years... and I couldn't disagree more. It fell into pretty much all the same old habits. The world may be huge, but aside from the main quest locations, the rest of the world is just filled with samey, borderline copy/paste material. Again it's fine at first but it starts to feel like you're never seeing or doing anything new after a while. There are lots of enemy camps, NPC stations are almost always the same horse ranch again and again, puzzles to get collectibles like the korok seeds repeat dozens of times.

There are certain key areas of the map with unique events, but most of these I found pretty boring if not aggravating in some way. There's that big featureless maze box in one corner of the map, the lost trial and error woods, and the Yiga Clan Lair which is a forced stealth section with instant failure if you're spotted, just to give a few examples. Most of these side places that should have been interesting didn't make me very happy.

Another example of reused assets is the shrines. I'm actually on board with the idea of these, since the world is so big it makes sense to have a lot of smaller mini dungeons dotted around the map, but I still felt they managed to botch this to a degree. They all have the exact same big blue cube look to them no matter which region they're in, and at least a third of them are empty except for the reward, or just put you in a combat challenge with the same enemy with slight variation in what weapons it carries.

That brings me to my next example, the enemy variety. 80% of what you fight are moblins or lizalfos with color palette swaps. You go to one side of the map, red lizards. Go to the other side, blue lizards. Even mini bosses are the same everywhere you go too, either the fat pigs, the stone golems, or the man-lions you don't ever want to fight anyway because they kill you in one hit and tank 50 million damage. Hell even the main bosses at the end of each proper dungeon just feel like a variation of the same boss. Would it have killed them to put some more variety of foes in here? The world certainly is big enough! (Past Zelda games with 1% the map size had more content, and I'm talking about unique content, not copies.)

To add insult to injury, after completing each main dungeon, the difficulty in the world increases by populating the world, not with new enemy types, but more of the exact same ones with different colors that now take a dozen hits to kill rather than a few. They don't function any differently, or challenge you in any way, it just makes combat more tedious and eventually I started ignoring enemy encounters out in the world whenever possible.

I don't think BOTW is a bad game, I just don't see how it's any different from the medium standard of what open world games are like, except not having quest markers. They can do better than this.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Juras,08-03-2017,"Most overratted game i ever played. Just good game, nothing more. Journalism this days is joke. Graphics is outdated (i do not care about Switch tech power, its almost price of PS4 Pro), art design isn't my style but ok, music no memorable, Zelda VA is terrible. Part where Zelda shines is ""gameplay"", so many possibilities and mechanics from other games in ""one pack"". But its not enough to be perfect game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

KcWright,06-03-2017,First this game is not a 10 by any stretch in some areas the frame rate drops are so bad its unplayable.The stamina system is by far the worst thing implemented in any zelda game. Theres not much diversity of enemies and the dungeons are some of the weakest in the series. Now for the good theres no one way to play this game i can see or do something that you may never see or do the combat is great its way more complex and difficult then previous zelda games. I really enjoyed playing this game.,8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Renzokuken,08-03-2017,"Playing the switch version, the game is wonderful however anyone telling you this is a 10/10 game is objectively lying to you.

The pros:
Wonderful open world full of stuff to do.
Huge range of weapons.
Great boss encounters.
Interesting dungeons/shrine puzzles.
The same old great LoZ combat you know and love.
Tons of fanservice for players of the previous games.

The cons:
Framerate issues are horrendous, particularly with the switch in TV mode,
Content on the cartridge gated behind amibo's includes the best horse in the game.
Mediocre soundtrack in comparison to other titles in the series.
Climbing and swimming are tedious.
Weapons breaking too frequently is annoying.

All in all, it's a fantastic game, but it's marred by the technical limitations of the switch, sort the framerate issues out and the game would be a very solid 9/10",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Pannon,20-09-2018,"I am really stumped by the 10s and raving reviews. I am a big Nintendo fan and I did play zelda on SNES. Now that was a long time ago. ..Anyway, as I said, I'm not sure which game the 10 scorers and the review magazines playing or they maybe played, but not 40hrs or more. As other stated, there is a lot of running around in the big nothing. There are a lot of vast empty space with nothing and the cartoonized graphics hides the shortcoming of the Switch. It just can't render too much at once so they had to use extremely low quality textures in the game. Then, as I said, big grassy fields, rocky hills and flats with nothing beside grass hoppers and some birds. A lot of walking around. I'm disappointed by not having a cave or a dungeon to go monster hunting. The 1-shot one kill flower pottery (guardians) and some other 1-hit kill monsters are just super annoying and the most annoying have to be the always breaking weapons. Button mapping can be a pain. I constantly end up hitting sneak (left thumb stick down) while fighting and Link drops the shield cover and it's a dead sentence with one of the stronger monsters. The other is the ""lock on"" way to continuously hold the top left trigger. Why can't we just click once and be locked on? Why make it a painful experience? And as I said, the sneak -on/off is just super annoying, especially on the original controller. I heard the pro-controller sold separately is way better controller and strongly recommended for this game. But now...I have to cash out another $60 for it? That would make this game the most expensive game I have bought in years. The enemies are repetative also. Sitting by the fire, it's a rinse-repeat of approaching their camp sneaking, let loose some arrows to the one standing on the guard towers and then either pick them off with the bow or go into a melee. You gonna do this over and over and over...with a sort of increasing difficulty, but essentially the same thing. I am playing this game on an extra wide monitor, but nintendo doesn't support this format I think. The game is stretched like the monitor, but the quality of the resolution suffers greatly, not to mention I am not a fan of applying this cartoon skin over the 3D graphics. I'm just not, especially with the low quality textures and low quality polygon models. The game looks at least 10yrs old really, but again, the Switch just can't handle it, hardware-vise, it was already obsolete when it came out.
So anyway, the game can be fun, some fights can be exciting and some items can be interesting. But there is no way this game is a 10. 7 is the max..which is ""slightly better than average"", otherwise you have played this game a few times already, if you played the Farcry series or Assassin's Creed etc. it'll feel awfully a deja vu, right from the first mission you get.
Play it an enjoy it, but I don't think everyone is gonna finish this game entirely. It can get very boring and pointlessly time consuming.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Xiubaca,23-04-2017,"playing Breath of the Wild has ruined all other games for me, I'm not even kidding. even the previous Zelda installments feel like trash in comparison.

NeoTheFox,25-03-2017,"Ok, this game HAS problems. But it does what any game should do the best - entertain you. It's the most organic and alive open world I've ever seen, there is almost no gap between exploration, combat, and puzzle-solving. It's surprising how dense the content is for its size, yet it still manages to surprise me with new stuff after 100+ hours of the gameplay. The story is also being communicated through the world a lot, and the lore of this game is pretty solid too.
120 Shrines, 45 of which are not just puzzles you'll find randomly, is a perfect number - it's a totally realistic task to go through thanks to the shrine locator. The game developers are really good at understanding the desire to explore and baiting players from afar to visit interesting locations. Shrine quests are really great, personally, I liked the island challenge most, but there are other huge challenges scattered everywhere.

CreamyyStreams,16-03-2017,"Phenomenal game with a handful of poor design decisions you wouldn't expect from a Zelda title, even one that breaks new ground.

Impressively styled and expansive world with plenty of landscape variety and distinct biospheres. Settlements have character, whether they're majestic superstructures or quaint villages. Combat is simple but compelling and there are plenty of opportunities to use the environment to influence a fight. Shrine and 'dungeon' puzzles are for the most part fun and usually intuitive. I bought the Switch specifically for this game and I'm not disappointed.

However it's not /all/ sunshine and rainbows.

The inclusion of ubisoft towers is a cardinal sin for open world games at this point and you wouldn't expect such a tired, cliched 'feature' from Nintendo.

Shrines themselves are strangely scattered across the landscape as if an afterthought, only there for the benefit of the player and not at all 'integrated' into the world.

Weapon durability is handled terribly and serves only to force pauses in combat and add another layer of inventory management, and leads to decisions on the cost to reward ratio of most combat encounters being heavily slanted towards 'cost' - the loot dropped by the vast majority of enemies isn't worth the durability loss.

Character progression seems piecemeal and relies on your desire to scrounge across the world looking for shrines and seeds.

The dodge mechanic is for some bizarre reason a jump rather than a roll, which adds an unpleasant floaty element to otherwise enjoyable combat.

There's also an optimisation issue that surfaces when the console is docked. You'll see frequent frame rate drops when playing on a TV that don't arise in handheld configuration, which is bizarre for a system touted as a home console.

It looks like a long list and reads like most complaints are fairly petty or typical of open world games - and they are quite small complaints, for the most part. I'd still entirely recommend it. However the flaws are there, you will notice them and they do (as far as I'm concerned) justify an 8 rather than a 9 or 10. If you're willing to drop £280 or your regional equivalent on a new system you're unlikely to find a better exclusive game so far this console generation.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Revoltec,20-03-2017,"After about 50 hours of playing i feel like i am able to take my time now and review this game.

First, lets start with the good things:

-The game looks really pretty and the atmosphere is amazing.
-The game offers a lot of things to do and after 50 hours i still find a bunch of things to do.
-The fighting mechanic is amazing. I can not remember any sword based game in the last 10 years that felt so nice to play.
-The hundreds of small puzzles are really interesting most of the time.
-The overworld is full of things to discover, so it never feels empty.
-The story good, but nothing outstanding. Same as always.
-The soundtracks are not so noticeable as in earlier zelda games, but sound really good.

The bad things:

-The frame drops are definitely noticeable, but its not as bad as mentioned by other reviewers. Still sad to see something like that on a new nintendo console exclusive launch game.
-There is a really small amount of enemy types(lots of reskins), so after a few hours the fightings start to feel repetitive.
-The weapons breaks way to quickly, so if you find a cool new weapon, you will never use it in simple overworld fights, because you don't want to loose it.
-There is no treasure for Link to store good weapons or items, so your inventory will most often be full and you need to throw away cool stuff, because you already have lots of better things.
-most of the time the minidungeons are extremely easy to solve.
-the four big dungeons are all really similar to each other so it feels really boring to solve the third and the fourth one.
-there are no new abilities to learn, or mechanical items to get, like there were in every other zelda game. I really missed it to be able to discover new places because i got a new item or ability from beating a dungeon.

All in all, one can say that this Zelda game feels a lot different to every other Zelda game.
If you are looking forward to get an amazing new typical Zelda you may be disappointed, but if you can accept that this game has no typical Zelda style, you will enjoy most of the game.
I am a little upset, that after so many time of development there are still lots of things in the game, which feels ill thought through. Lots of minidungeons can be solved in a few seconds and the big dungeons are extremly similar to each other. I really think that this game could be much better and there is a lot of unused potential.
I'm already looking forward for the next zelda, which i think will use the same engine and hopefully makes all the mentioned bad thinks much better.

Smashley,07-03-2017,"I am currently about 15 hours in. I've followed some of the story points, and also just aimlessly explored the world. There are a lot of good points to this game. It really changes up the zelda formula, and in a good way in my opinion. The game is also very challenging, and this level of difficulty seems to be missing from many games as of late. As long as you follow the story points and don't stray too far off the intended course, enemy difficulty scales wonderfully to link's abilities, though you can just avoid them as well by staying in the mountains. There are a few problems right now, which is why I'm only giving it a 9. There are a lot of framerate issues, though not so dramatic that I could not continue playing normally, when playing in docked mode. I've noticed hardly any in handheld mode, and I believe they may fix in a future update, so I am not too concerned about it. Other than that the world is definitely not empty, and is a very solid open world game and a very solid zelda game. I would play it all day if I was able.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
blackphoenix60,08-03-2017,"This is a great game. The gameplay itself is quite great.

The only thing that should be improved is strictly QoL that really don't detract from how great the game is. Weapons break fairly easily and there are too few slots for weapons/shields/bows.

Fredinator2011,14-03-2017,"The game we waited 3 years for was finally released. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was worth every second of that 3 year wait. Every single Zelda game came together and made this masterpiece.

BOTW is an over world game that gives the best depiction of Hyrule. You can walk anywhere and glide from any platform you see. The Great Plateau is the starting area which is massive. You can go around and kill things and get weapons.

After you exit the Great Plateau, you enter the massive world of Hyrule.

The end goal is to defeat Calamity Ganon who resides in Hyrule Castle. You can take him on right away or you can adventure through Hyrule to get better gear.

There are 5 Main dungeons in the game. Divine Beast Ruta, Divine Beast Rudania, Divine Beast Medoh, Divine Beast Naboris, and Hyrule Castle. The dungeons are very creative and fun to go through.

While there are only 5 dungeons there are actually 120 Shrines. Shrines are mini dungeons that reward you with a Spirit Orb. You can trade in 4 Spirit Orbs for a Heart Container or a Stamina Booster.

My favorite concept in the game is cooking. You can cook certain ingredients to make food that can boost stamina, make you faster, etc. Some even increase your hearts.

The combat is very good and the game is very moderate with difficulty. No hand holding or anything.

Breath of the Wild shows you how to play by continuing on in the game. It is the greatest Zelda game and possibly one of the greatest games ever made. This is my new favorite game of all time.

Memulatron,16-03-2017,"I'm gonna start off by saying that this game is not perfect. Going in and out of the inventory screen constantly is tedious, the weapons breaking is irritating, and there are several parts of the world that are empty and uninteresting. I'm giving this game a 10, however, because of what it's done for the Zelda series, what it's done for Nintendo, as well as the fact that it's the best, most approachable, and most consistently brilliant and beautiful open-world game ever made. There are so many different and unique locations, every minor NPC is on a schedule that helps the world seem alive, the combat is interesting and challenging, the customizability of Link's loadout is mind-bogglingly diverse, and the game is just so much fun to play. I don't ever want to put this game down. There's always something new to do, and that's something that not many open-world games exhibit nowadays. If you have a Wii U or if you're still debating whether or not to get a Switch, get it for this game. It is so good, you won't regret it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ArchTalko,15-03-2017,"I've rarely played a game that treats me with the level of respect Breath of the Wild gives. I'd argue this game isn't as hard as people make it out to be; the puzzles are genuinely challenging and the combat encounters can be brutal, but the amount you struggle is directly related to the amount of time you devote to preparing for these encounters. The fact that there are, at any given time, a couple dozen ways to go about fighting any enemy or clearing any puzzle speaks volumes to this game's replayability and ingenuity.

It's not a perfect game. The frame rate is horrendous in plenty of spots (at least when docked; I haven't experienced any slowdown in those same areas when playing on handheld), the voice acting is just okay at best, and more often than not bland and rushed. The ost does a wonderful job of setting this game's mood and compliments the gameplay perfectly, but leaves a lot to be desired with the crazy amounts of catchy tunes found in previous Zeldas.

But honestly, none of these nitpicks matter. BotW is a masterpiece in engaging combat, in creating a fully-realized hyrule teeming with puzzles to uncover, and in wrapping it all around a story that had me invested from the moment Link opens his eyes. You owe it to yourself to play this game, even if you've never played another Zelda in your life. Despite the flaws, every other strength is massive enough to still warrant a 10. Play it - we all need a fish boyfriend in our lives.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

pjtaylor2011,20-03-2017,"...I´ve never played a Zelda game before. I´ve been gaming for 38 years now, but the wii was my first nintendo console, so Zelda was never something I even looked at. So I didn´t know what to expect, but was impressed enough by the reviews to grab myself a switch and a copy of Botw. It took a long while to get into, the game tells you initially what you must do, but not how. So used to being told where to go with icons, scattered about maps telling you what is there, Zelda at first felt a little daunting. It tells you that you can discover recipies, but doesn´t tell you what they are, just a Very limited supply of ingredients for you to experiment with. I must confess that i did cheat and looked up a recipe for keeping warm and that enabled me to finish the first area. Once that has been done the world is then open for you and things speed up a hell of alot. I´m still not very far into the game, but am now loving it. I´ve scored it a 9, because I think if you dont score it something, it would score the game 0. I think this could well end up being a 10/10, its certainly drawn me in. I understand some of the low scores, at the start of the game there is a frustrating lack of direction given to the player and until you dare (know how to) venture into a inhospitable area of the map there seems to be little going on. This game is going to reward those with patience, gamers who are willing to invest their time and thinking into the game. Zelda has a new fan.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ljungman,18-03-2017,"I'm a long time Zelda fan and my favourite Zelda has always been Ocarina of Time. The feeling I got when I first played Ocarina of Time and completed it is the best feeling I've ever had in my gaming life. The story, the music, the characters and the world are just so impactful in that game. Didn't expect to find a game that gave me that feeling ever or at least for a long time. I'm happy to say that Breath of the Wild has given me everything I was hoping for and it is now my absolute favourite game of all time. I'm not saying that the game is perfect, but the feeling you get while playing with everything combined (world, music, characters, puzzles, bosses and so on) is truly amazing.

For people rating this game a 0 because of graphics or high Metacritic score: When did graphics become more important than fun? Try the game yourself, and you truly will understand what an amazing piece of art this is. Even if you don't like the game because it's not for you or for other reasons, you can't say that there is no beauty in it or that it is a bad game.

invertedzero,20-03-2017,"This game is one of the most frustrating 9/10 to 10/10 games I have ever played. Where it excels, it's an example to gaming, it feels like how we imagined 'next-gen' gaming should be. It brings great elements of exploration and survival to the franchise. However, I happen to agree with many of the mixed and negative review criticisms that other users have put down - lack of BGM, lop-sided structure, lack of progression outside of stat and survival bonuses to make exploration meaningful, repetitive bestiary where it matters, not a high enough ratio of interactivity and story to the size of the open world, many secrets just amount to collectathons, combat even with different weapon types is more shallow mechanically than some past 3D Zeldas despite the great panic instilled against some more powerful enemies that can wipe clean all your hearts, lack of cohesive dungeons and puzzles, lack of caves, truthfully, as much as it teaches its past iterations and other games how to evolve, it could also learn from them and take a bit more from the Metroidvania formula with regards to large world exploration. If it did, it would make the world feel even more gigantic and less-barren. The towns are a bit formulaic and many NPCs generic. The game is far too free and nonrestrictive, in that there's not a lot to collect or find that will actually help you to explore or reach inaccessible areas, because there virtually are none. Most of the key items are gained from the start of the game, and it make the exploration feel like it's lacking progression, a bit pointless outside of the point of the joy of exploration and stat upgrades in their selves. There isn't quite as much to see as you'd hope in many areas. There is not enough opportunity to use the Sheikah slate powers in the game's world. You just get token metal crates sparsely scattered to use magnesis on, and most of the world isn't susceptible to stasis.
I can't help but think a few staples or new (non-necessary) additions at least somewhere further into the game could have been useful to help navigate the world and make it less repetitive while doing so. It would be a revelation for example if at some point through the game you could obtain iron boots and swimming equipment to go underwater, then you think of all the places you've been past that had water. There were many places in OoT that reacted to new items you got - for example the ocarina songs generating faries, or bombs creating holes. Wouldn't it have been like a whole other dimension if halfway through the game you obtained an item that granted you the ability to talk to or transform into animals, or something else to change and interact with weather? Even obtaining round/square bombs could have been seperated so that perhaps you could revisit areas where you needed to roll a bomb down a crack that you couldn't with a square bomb. It all sadly limits the potential of the exploration and discovery. All this still doesn't take away from what they've achieved, and what they have achieved is obvious to most who play it and from the other positive reviews, it does however create a frustrating dent that doesn't allow me to award it a 10. I agree with many points made in the negative reviews, but it doesn't stop it from being a top-quality game that's far better than most out there today. In the next iteration i'd like to see more refined combat, greater purpose of exploration through taking a bit more from metroidvania and past zeldas, and more enclosed areas, pathways, caves, to give some variety to the exploration, more world interaction and a few more interesting NPCs and story",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SimonD00,23-05-2017,"This is not a perfect game, not even close but I don't think that's what a 10/10 represents, rather I think the 10/10 shows how much I enjoyed the experienced and even though this is not the most graphically impressive game ever made and yes sometimes there were some frame drops, but it never once hindered my experience with the game. The exploration in this game is unrivaled, you can spend hours upon hours just walking around in the world and your always rewarded by your time. Combat is surprisingly deep and fun only beaten by the dark souls combat but nothing even comes close to dark souls so that's no criticism. I've heard that some people have called this game empty and I don't know which game they've been playing but this game is far from it, rather I feel like this game nearly has too much too do, if that's even possible, because it's hard to get to the main quest when your constantly occupied by some side activity. With only 4, this game has the least amount of dungeons in the series and you would think that that would be a disadvantage but first and for most the 4 you get are all amazing and will take some time to figure out and secondly with 120 shrines that work kind of like mini dungeons the void that could have been made by the small amount of dungeons is filled. The last thing I want to talk about in this review is the story. This is another section of the game that has received a lot of criticism, and yes the story loses some of the focus since your allowed to go everywhere you want so it's hard to feed you a constant stream of story, but the story that is here is all amazing and probably better than any other Zelda game before. The most impressive thing to me is how the character of Zelda is built. She is given an actual personality I'm not going to spoil anything here but I promise you, you will get the feels for this character. To conclude, this is an amazing game with an unrivaled sense of wonder and adventure. The game isn't without its flaws but it never hinders the experience, everyone is in-titled to their own opinion and it's OK if you didn't enjoy the game like I did but in my book this is a 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Greering,08-03-2017,"This game is truly fantastic and rekindled a sense of awe, and adventure in me I haven't had in years! That said, I will not shower it with glowing praise, and instead point out the things that dragged the game down from being perfect for me, in the hopes it can be made to achieve its true potential if these issues get addressed in some way.

First of all, although I appreciate the weapon durability mechanic, I think that it is a little too harsh in some cases, mid to high level weapons in particular ought to have longer usability than they currently do.

Second, I feel that the final phase of the Calamity Ganon boss fight was lackluster. I know it was meant to be somewhat cinematic, but at the same time, coming out of the first phase there really should have either been a third, or the second made more involved.

Third, is a big one for me, but I feel that overall enemy variety, and lack of visually distinct dungeons hurts the game somewhat, due to the repetitiveness of the shrines. Even the Divine Beasts, are small levels compared to dungeons in previous entries.

Fourth is the lopsided attention the major races received. It's very clear to those that play, that the Rito and Goron races had the last amount of content and overall effort put into their storylines and characters.

Fifth is very big for me, and I hope it can be remedied in some way either through DLC, or tie-in media like comics/short movie/cartoons, etc. The four Champions were paraded around and teased quite a lot before release, but in the end despite being apparently important characters, they each receive less than around 5 minutes of total screentime in the game to develop. This is very disappointing given their great designs and concept. You don't really get enough material to truly feel for them, or get to know their full relationship with Link and Zelda. Revali for example, seemed like he could be an interesting rival type character for Link, but the lack of screentime makes him just come off as kind of a jerk, and way too similar to Star Fox's Falco, rather than entirely his own character.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Mecanicas increibles (sobre todo la interacción con los elementos)
Muy buena banda sonora
El mejor sistema de combate visto hasta la fecha en un Zelda
Una historia sobresaliente
Un mundo abierto que por fín es abierto de verdad ya que no existen limites

En definitiva un mundo que no te cansarás de explorar y que ofrece posibilidades ilimitadas ya que nunca hay una sola opción con la que superar un reto si no que cada uno afrontará su aventura de forma diferente.

Toda una Obra Maestra.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
avikm12301,05-03-2017,"epixxxx ya boi knows, dis gem is de best game of the 2010's by my opinion its graphical style is bold and looks great the soundtrack is epic and has some of the best video game songs of all time (of course its my opinion so don't rage haters)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
krysinello,10-03-2017,"Never has an open world game felt so alive and interesting to explore, yet Nintendo have done it. Breath of the Wild is spectacular, with each part of the world filled with interesting secrets to mechanics. The world might seem barren at first, but the game not only invites exploration, but also attention, as a simple rock, and formation might hold a secret, to the environment itself becoming puzzles, either for combat or unlocking Shrines, to it being a korok seed puzzles. The environment itself becomes apart of the game play and not just a platform from travelling from place to place.

Almost everything in the game can be used for a purpose, trees, grass, mountains, wild life, and you are able to effectively utilize almost everything to your advantage, set fire to grass, to create an updraft then bombard an enemy encampment with bomb arrows, use rocks to hide, and attempt to sneak up on enemies etc. The amount of freedom is unparalleled in this title for what you can do.

Everything is driven dynamically, weather, including wind, thunder storms rain etc, the weather can play an important part. During a thunder storm, carrying anything metal will probably get you struck by lightning, but this can apply to enemies as well... tough to beat enemy in a thunder storm? Drop a metal weapon, trick it into picking it up, and wait for him to get fried. This game is versatility at it's best, and promotes discovery, quick thinking and figuring out methods, that can be outside of the norm depending on the situation you find yourself in.

The game starts out with very little hand holding at all, the Great Plateau is the opening area, there you get a little guidance on what to do, from there, after you get the para-glider it's completely open. You can complete the objective set out before you, with some small guidance, or you can go out, explore, unlock area maps, complete Shrines, and find the little environmental puzzles integrated to the environment. You unlock most of your abilities early within the game, which gives you the freedom to explore.

The game is quite challenging, early on, it follows what you might call the standard difficulty of a Zelda title, enemies only doing a fraction of your health damage, particular the red bokoblin's, so frequent at the start, however, this soon changes, as the game starts to increase the frequency and spawns of more difficult enemies the more you end up defeating. The next hardest line of Bokoblin's, the blue ones can almost one shot you, and sometimes can early enough in the game. Basically you're going to die if you just charge in, and as such, need to effectively find ways to deal with large groups of enemies. This is where utilizing the environment, stealth and objects surrounding are required.

Weapons themselves have a set durability. Early on, the durability of items will be limited, often breaking, requiring you to hunt other weapons, or defeat enemies to obtain new ones. Later on, you will get access to longer lasting items. This keeps up the games dynamic, switching weapons not only for situation, but also for the style of situation you find yourself in.

The story of the game itself, is rather simple, but is told in an effective way, but even the majority of the story content is optional, you are free if you wish, to go straight to the final boss, and attempt to defeat him, although you will probably fail. The main plot basically relates to you as Link, being asleep and recovering for 100 years, with no memories, going out with the simple goal of freeing the 4 divine beasts, recovering your memories, and defeating calamity Ganon. The 120 shrines included main purposes are for teaching you mechanics, loot, and receiving spirit orbs, which 4 can be exchange by praying to receive an additional heart container, or more stamina. How you upgrade your stats is completely up to you, you can go all Stamina, which means you can run longer, climb longer, swim for longer, or on heart containers, which means you might actually be able to survive a hit. Some enemies can hit you for a whopping 14 hearts, getting one shot killed is common, and even later with more heart containers, getting 2 shot killed is common.

The main dungeons in the game, break the Zelda convention, the 4 divine beasts are these dungeons, and are one giant puzzle, expanded upon on the Shrine mechanics. Conquering these give you powerful abilities that can be used in battle, but also make the final boss encounter considerably easier.

There are a few flaws however, the frame rate does have some issues in a few areas, these are minimal and hardly retract from the experience, 99% of the time, it will hold up to the 30 fps goal. Since it does use a double buffer vsync solution however, if it does dip below 30fps, it will result in it dropping to the next lowest denominator, being 20fps, but these are very infrequent.

Overall, Breath of the Wild is brilliant, a near master piece.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Wizelf402,11-03-2017,"This is most likely my favorite game of all time. I have been a fan of Zelda ever since I first played it, and this raises it to an entirely new level of amazing. It's an incredible open world experience. The story is great, the combat feels fluid, and the world never feels empty. Nintendo has sidestepped all of the flaws that open world games usually have and created a true masterpiece. This is my vote for Game of The Year and anyone who gives this game a mixed or negative review is lying to themselves.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
isaymoo,09-03-2017,"This game is great. I actually own all of the amiibo, both breath of the wild series and Zelda 30th. By far this is my favorite Zelda game ever. I guarantee that every single idiot who is not giving this game at least 8 out of 10 has never played it, and the raw amount of things you can do is amazing, nothing is too easy or too difficult, and this game is just plain good.

ernchii,10-03-2017,"I have only scratched the surface of the game and already I am deeply engrossed with it. The world feels vast and exciting, the fact that you can go anywhere that looks interesting (which is almost everywhere in this game) is liberating and so, so fun. Just roaming the large forests, climbing every inch of a mountain and running frantically from enemies that are trying to kill me, this game is exciting and encourages exploration and experimentation. I find myself getting distracted so many times. Even when I only need to walk a few more feet up to a shrine, a enclave in the distance distracts me, or there is something glimmering in a distant tree that beckons me to go over. It is simply amazing.

The only flaws of this game are it's frame drops, so far only seen in areas with lots of grass, and the fact that the Sheikah Slate is hard to activate, although that is not the game's fault, rather the poor placement of the '-' on the joycon.

In short, Breath of the Wild is fun. And that is all that matters in a game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jimjim101,05-03-2017,"A great open world game with a lot of the charm that was missing from many of the earlier titles. The main downsides are typical of open world games: you can be unsure what to do next, and it's very easy to find the hardest possible solution to a problem. There's also one very specific shortcoming: it doesn't tell you how to cook, and there's no contextual option to do so. Part of the way it wins its charm back, though, is by not telling you how to progress, so when you do something there's genuinely a feeling that you're having an adventure rather than being along for the ride.

Skyrimming is pretty streamlined - Link specifically can climb (as well as jump!) so if you want to go up a mountain it's generally just a matter of finding a good route. The cooking brings a surprisingly down-to-earth element to the survival gameplay; it's almost a shame that there's no more complexity to it than selecting the ingredients. The world feels appropriately sized and reasonably populated.

The general structure is a lot looser than other Zelda games, with a large number of one-or-two-room shrines replacing a small number of dungeons (this works a bit better for pacing as the puzzle-solving is in short bursts interspersed in the other gameplay). The setting is fairly standard Zelda faire, just a bit more large-scale and more actively backward-looking than usual. Graphics are fairly nice cell-shaded-ish, the music ranges from epic to disconcertingly like a bad ringtone - although the variety helps hint what's going on at the time. The gameplay gimmicks include normal open world tricks (detecting nearby things, fast travel, fancy maps) and a handful of powers/weapons acquired through a relatively traditional big-chest-like process very early in the game. All other weapons as you'd expect from Zelda games are found in random chests or pop out from defeated enemies - because they all have durability and eventually break, possibly with a couple of exceptions.

In short: it's quite the adventure.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

sushi24,11-03-2017,"I created an account just to write a review for Zelda:

This game feels like I was playing a gamified mix of Studio Ghibli Miyazaki's movies Spirited Away, Princess Mononoke and Nausicaa, it recalls those feelings with music (Is this Joe Hisaishi's???) and atmospheres. Usually when I play a game I try to rush to the end, while with this one I often find myself looking at the horizon.

Deserves a 10 in every category, but becomes a 9 due to the dropped frames when docked, not a deal breaker. I am happy I bought the switch just to play this game, totally worth the price. I feel like I am 10 again.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I haven't been able to do any work for the past week, I don't know how long this will last but currently there is still too much to do and too much to see. I love how the game world feels incredibly polished, and the developers and programmers have thought of just about EVERYTHING when it comes to the player and how they want to play.

barbosaK,09-03-2017,"Why do people feel a need to review a game they don't own. Because it's not on your console of choice? The gaming community is becoming toxic.

Though Sony fans are definitely doing it more. Over 1200 Negative reviews? Petty.

Anyways, I would highly recommend Breath of the Wild. If you're a fan of Zelda games, you'll love it. It still plays and feels like a Zelda game but was finally modernized to incorporate an actual quest system. I didn't care for the joy cons but am loving the game on the Pro controller. It's a beautiful game, despite low quality textures and frame rate issues. But it's running on a portable gaming tablet so these issues are permissible. It's important to consider hardware constraints when reviewing a game. I've never seen a game look this good on a hand held. The story is told in a unique way.

To explore the cold regions, you need warm clothing. And vice versa for the desert regions. You can get round this by cooking spicy food. Or carrying a torch. Or building a fire. As you can see, there are so many different ways to approach the game. The stamina aspect is annoying at first, but you can upgrade it which is a MUST!

Only 10 or so hours through, but from what I've seen it gets even better once the story starts rolling.

I know not everyone likes Zelda/Nintendo, and that fine. I hear Horizon and Nier are both great games for PS4, and I suggest if you have one give them a try. But just know that a good game on a Nintendo platform isn't a threat to your livelihood, there is no justifiable reason to blanket spam 0 reviews for a game you admit to have never played.

Regardless, they are instrumental in unlocking the map data. The shrines give you more of a classic Zelda puzzle design that is missing from the world. The music is very lacking in the game compared to past Zeldas. I'm guessing that was a stylistic choice. I just miss the looped overtones.

YEEyee,10-03-2017,"As a huge fan of this series I am glad to see a difference in the way we can play this game, it is your adventure and you can decide how you want to play the game. Only issue i have had with this game is probably the fps, but I myself look past it as i am too mesmerized by the fact that the open world and these game mechanics are a part of a legend of zelda game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ItsAllOgre5,11-03-2017,"What I love about this game is just how packed the world is. Yes, there are a few large stretches of nothing, but most of the time, you can't go 10 feet without stumbling into something interesting: a settlement, a shrine (a little puzzle dungeon), a monster camp, an animal to hunt, a minigame, an item cache... even just some scenery, like a waterfall, which benefits from the game's painterly visuals. And the thing is, the designers were clearly very confident in this world's ability to inspire wonder and entertain, because it's all optional and you can go fight the final boss right after starting the game, before even getting into the interesting story. Speaking of fighting, I enjoy it. The weapon durability system forces you to not just spam your strongest weapon, and the enemies are the toughest they've been since Zelda 1, though I do wish they had more attacks and variety. The best part is that there are many ways to do things, be it dispatching enemies or solving puzzles. It just gives you tools to play in its enormous sandbox; the world is so interactive, and even with all this, I still haven't encountered a single glitch, so besides a few framerate problems in the starting area and in forests, the game is remarkably stable, especially for an unoptimized port of a Wii U game. The pros easily outweigh the cons, and all this makes Breath of the Wild the best open-world game I've ever played.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
noyashni,11-03-2017,"I was going to give it a 9, but I'm leaning 10 now. The game is that good. This Zelda game presents you with so much to do. I haven't enjoyed the side quests this much since Majora's Mask. The only thing I hated was the rain preventing you from climbing. It was annoying slipping down a mountain after climbing.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
billionbites,11-03-2017,"Breath of the wild is one of the best games I've ever played, and I've owned quite a lot of the major systems since the Sega Master System. The game stands out because it really transports you into the world, the art style is also remarkable in parts as well and I often found myself taking pictures of the landscape creating cinematic stills of my journey in the game.

This is a very important game, not only for Nintendo but for the art of computer games in whole, so much love has gone into the game that you really feel that this game is a piece of Art, which not all games are. The Music also makes you feel that this game is a very cinematic experience.

I think it is unfair to compare Nintendo to Sony or Microsoft, they have so much more of the entertainment industry behind them including the film industry. This game is a defining chapter in modern video game history, and Nintendo should be supported by the gaming community in a major way in helping push forward
video games for the best.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It is a totally huge world, so you will find yourself getting lost in it all the time. I have not beat the game yet, and I don't intend to for a little bit longer just so that I can explore even more. Every single place has something new and exciting. It's not just a bunch of mountains and fields to make it look big. The world is packed with everything that you could ever want. The weapons breaking seems like it would be pretty annoying, which it can be at times, but otherwise, it is really cool because you feel like you are in the world and trying to survive. There are some places that have slight frame drops, but who honestly cares. Get this game. I wouldn't be surprised if it game got game of the year. You should just get it right now. Also, don't lick the cartridge :)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Timmaahh,11-03-2017,"(DISCLAIMER: I am a PC gamer, I don't play on consoles often, there is a TL:DR at the bottom for those without patience to read through the entire thing.)

First off: Nintendo are NOT known for their games to be super high resolution, so you 4k snobs who rated low, the console or PC master race people who's visual standards are too high to satisfy are missing the point entirely. This game is all about the game-play, and this is where Breath of the Wild shines.

Breath of the Wild is an amazing addition to the story bringing a lot of people back to Ocarina of Time days, while still remaining new, exciting, and different. The nostalgia is definitely there. But this is unlike any Legend of Zelda game. Quite literally has the same characters and some new ones, but throws you into a world that is entirely different from any of the previous installments. Sure. Hyrule castle is there, Goron mountain is there, the Zoras and Gerudos are there but they are implemented in a way that they haven't been before, while keeping true to the nature of their respective beliefs and attitudes.

The overall game-play of hunting and gathering, breakable weapons and shields, and puzzles that make you THINK makes Breath of the Wild challenging, while still being fun and rewarding. The open-ended, sandbox style, ""go wherever you want,"" and ""there is no wrong way to play,"" style of game-play is a welcomed addition to the franchise as well.

The soundtrack, while being newly composed, has tones from the original Legend of Zelda and I found myself recognizing many of the tracks. Loving that the music was so new, but still nostalgic. The music alone gets a 10/10.

My review may be biased because when I was a kid I played Ocarina of time on my Nintendo 64. One of my most favorite games of all time. While this game brings those of us who played those games back, it also does well in telling the story as you go which will help those who are just now playing their first Legend of Zelda game.

If you are thinking about picking this game up, I highly recommend getting it. Only people that have a hard time figuring things out themselves, those who lack critical thinking skills, or those who lack the ability to problem solve and take time to think things out wont like this game. LOZ:BotW doesn't hold your hand, rather gives you dialogue queues to push you in certain directions if you are truly lost. But even then you have to find the right person to talk to.

TL:DR - Breath of the Wild has a deep story with some nostalgic tones, amazing game-play mechanics, puzzles that make you actually think, all while keeping true to the series.

SrRama,13-03-2017,"Vivir una experiencia de juego así sucede muy poquitas veces en la vida, tras más de 20 años como jugador multiplataforma(siempre con PC como plataforma principal) Nintendo ha conseguido dejarme maravillado , ha conseguido que me crea un videojuego que me sienta el protagonista, que el mundo que representa me resulte ""mi otro mundo.

-Banda sonora, voces, traducción efectos de sonido que quitan el hipo
-Los cambios de climatológicos y las transacciones de día a noche son impresionantes
-Las físicas del juego hacen todo creíble
-La libertad de ""escribir tu aventura"" me recuerda al libro Rayuela de Julio Cortázar(salvando las distancias) es una mavarilla tener esa libertad y que todo encaje de manera perfecta.

Podría tirarme todo el día enumarando pequeños detalles como la vegetación, el comportamiento de los animales, el tema de escalar y poder ir a donde quieras y no pararía de escribir, como único punto negativo algunas caídas de frames en modo tv que espero que con el tiempo lo solucionen con actualizaciones aunque para nada arruinan la experiencia de juego.

weetabixfork,13-03-2017,"I have truly enjoyed playing this game, so much! The open world experience is huge and excellent, with so much to do. There are over 120 shrines/dungeons to complete, and the open world s littered with side quests and mini-games. This game offers hours and hours of playability. Plus there is a huge range of weapons, gear and other collectables. The RPG experience is great too, as there is loads of room to upgrade Link throughout. The music fits very well. The story is interesting. I also love the dynamic physics of the game, which is surprisingly realistic. The way you can burn, freeze, electrocute and wet stuff. It makes the game so much more immersive. As a software developer myself, I can see a lot of top-class programming has gone into this game. The graphics may not be super duper real-world realistic, like recent releases, such as Horizon Zero Dawn, but the stylistic look they have gone for in Zelda, makes the game more realistic and immersive. For instance, the plants actually move when you walk through them, unlike the game just mentioned. In other words, the graphics are timeless and beautiful. You may think my review is over the top, but I really can't stop playing this game. Some may not like this, but I will say that this game is better the Ocarina of Time. This game is a must play for everyone!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Walboro,13-03-2017,"This game breaks the mold in so many new and invigorating ways that it's impossible to take it all in. I have racked up over 20h in game at this point and I still don't think I've even scratched the surface however in that time I've laughed, saddened, gotten frustrated by the ridiculously OP enemies (My first encounter with a Lynel being one that sticks in my mind immediately), been genuinely excited when those same OP enemies have finally fallen before my sword. This IS a Zelda game and anybody who has ever played one will know every part of this game's lore and feel right at home in the now decemated version of Hyrule, giving those players a legitimate want to restore the land which some players have spent 30 years defending in some cases, and in this form it has never been more rewarding to do so as the game doesn't hold your hand even a little.

The graphics are stylized in a way which will be timeless in the same way that Wind Waker's graphics are still pieces of art today when compared to games of the time which were considered to have ""more realistic"" graphics, Nintendo are well aware that ""photo realistic graphics"" will age far worse as technology progresses and so making graphics in a certain style perfectly is obviously the correct way to go.

Sound design is flawless, creating immersive environments through audio cues and simple yet beautiful orchestral set pieces.

The item management aspect of the game is more a breath of fresh air rather than a breath of the wild, forcing players to learn the strengths and weaknesses of each weapon rather than finding the most powerful weapon and using it for the remainder of the game. I have literally beaten a boss with the severed arm of another enemy as I had no other choice which (although scary) made the victory all the sweeter.

Could this game have been optomized more for switch? Probably, but with the game being a damn-near perfect gaming experience, was it needed? No, of course not.

On a side-note, Breath of the wild is best described as the Dark Souls of Zelda, if you are unprepared for a fight, even the most basic enemy WILL one-shot you.

All in all, Legend of Zelda Breath of the wild is by far, the best Zelda game in recent memory, which is really saying a lot considering notable entries such as Skyward Sword, Majora's Mask 3D, Wind Waker and A Link between Worlds. The only minus point I can even nit-pick about is the load times when first booting the game up into the map itself which realistically are not any longer than you would expect for a game of this scale.

10/10, a perfect gaming experience which everybody should play in their life.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
sarp3don,13-03-2017,Zelda's formula has become stale over the years and the series needed a fresh look. I didn't expect Nintendo to go as far as they did with this game. It brings so much to the genre that it exceeded any of my expectations. The world seems handcrafted with rewards for the player that pokes around and gets lost. The game looks beautiful and the sounds are pleasing for the ear. Its a great experience for which you may need plenty of time to discover most of the game. But it never seems like work.

You need just one minute to be free to do what you want, and one hour later playing story mode you have power enough to visit every area, the choice to think what you will do next is yours.
Almost everything on the map look put in there for a reason, and it's hard to walk for a minute without finding some life where you are, there is always stuff you can do, a lot of monster with own complex scripts and having some interactivity with the map.
NPC also changes their reactions to current weather, making them more dynamic.
The music is excellent executed, appearing just when it should to be, and dungeons were nicely updated.

DestinyOrbiter,14-03-2017,"In my opinion, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Breath of the wild is a game all about exploration and freedom. You can do anything and go anywhere that you think of. See a giant mountain in the distance? You can go there! Want to go hunting? You can do it! However unlike Skyrim you cannot kill or hurt NPCs. This game graphically is outstanding and looks to me like a mixture of cell shading and watercolor which is gorgeous. The world is so massive and full of life that you will have a tough time staying on task because you will see a cool structure in the distance, or an enemy camp, or even an NPC in distress. The weapon system is a little weird at first because your weapons break so easily that you will SWEAR they're made of glass but its easily adaptable to and it actually help add to the difficulty of the game. Speaking of difficulty this game is hard. YOU WILL DIE. especially near the beginning where enemies can one shot you. The music is more atmospheric is this Zelda installment which is weird because in other Zelda games your used to epic soundtracks with songs that get stuck in your head for days. However the music choice fits the game and it is beautiful. The story is excellent with characters you care about and unique missions throughout. The voice acting is good but I feel it could be a bit stronger on characters such as Impa. The side quests are also varied and different. I have not run into any repetitive side quests in my time playing thus far. In conclusion This game is amazing and can easily outclass its current rival, Horizon Zero Dawn. This game is a joy to play throughout especially with the 120 mini-dungeons called shrines that are scattered throughout. You will have a rough time putting this game down for even five minutes and that's why I give this game its deserved 10/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

NintendoCritic,14-03-2017,"Nintendo's The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is by far the best Zelda I have played, I feel great to say is that for me, this Zelda is the best Zelda. BotW is such a beautiful game, the story, the combat, the cooking, the characters, etc.

[Story]
Link has fallen during combat and was placed in the resurrection chamber for one hundred years. Link wakes up hearing a mysterious voice. That's where the game starts you off. You can decide on what you want to do, know more about the story or just go get good gear and go face off Calamity Ganon. The power of player's choice is what makes the story great. I won't spoil the story at all, so don't worry.

[Combat]
BotW's combat is way different from any other Zelda game. Enemies are way tougher then you think and they don't take their turns combating you. So be prepared, get good gear and do the shrines to increase your heart gauge or make food.

[Cooking]
This was a great idea. Who doesn't want to cook? Nintendo made cooking fun to do and didn't make it feel like it was necessary. On my first playthough, I didn't cook at all. Now on my second play, I can't stop cooking. The sounds were enjoyable to hear and it made it feel awarding to the player if they did.

[Characters]
This game has voice acting, only on cutscenes that is. Other then that they speak gibberish or say single words to you. The Zora's were by far the best looking characters in the game, I thought that their design were soo cool. The other characters like the Gorons and the villagers had great designs as well. Beedle returns in this game and he was such a cool characters, it was fun to talk to him and trade him my items.

[Climbing]
This was an awesome feature in the game. Climbing to places is always fun, trying to climb to places that seem reachable but aren't was also fun. Climbing in general is fun. All I did was climb, I can't stop climbing. CAN'T STOP CLIMBING! I need help...

[Amiibo]
Amiibos don't change gameplay much. They give you food, rupees, gears, and horses. You can only use amiibos once a day. I won't go into detail on special things certain amiibo do, I'll let you have that experience. My only complaint that I have with these amiibos are that they are hard to find in stores. NINTENDO BRING US MORE AMIIBOS IN STOCK!

BotW also has changed, add, and remove so many things in the Zelda formula that made it not Zelda but ""still made it feel like a Zelda"" game. This game has a lot to offer or a lot not to offer at all, it all depends on your playing style. Do you want to beat the game quick or do you want to take your time on it? That is the answer to the question.

There are four big dungeons (the divine beasts), one hundred and twenty mini dungeons (shrines (each shrine you complete give you a spirit orb, these orbs in return give you heart containers or stamina containers; your choice), nine hundred korok seeds to collect (theses seeds increase your inventory (swords, bows, shields)), and seventy-five side quests to do. That's a lot of stuff to do!

I wouldn't say don't listen to anyone's review that is on here, positive or negative but I do respect everyone that is on here. What I don't understand on is why are people being so negative on their reviews and giving their review a zero score. Why? Don't be biased, don't make a review just cause people are giving this game a perfect score. But also I'm not calling out on anyone's review that actually have played the game and that they didn't enjoy it. I know that there are some people out there that loved Zelda as much as I do and didn't have a great experience with this game. For an example, Skyward Sword. That game had a decent score because of the motion controls. Some people loved it, some people hated it. I gave this review a ten score because of how fun of a experience I had with it and I'm still playing it today. I'm still trying to get all the shrines, the korok seeds, and the side quests; that's going to take me a long time to do and I'm going to have fun doing it.

I hope you guys enjoyed my review and I encourage you to read others as well, positive or negative reviews.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

HylianWiesner,15-03-2017,"This game had me from the get go. I got the LTD edition on the day it came out together with a Nintendo Switch - And man, is this game an experience. I have been a fan of Zelda since the age of 4, and I can assure you, this game is nothing but a true masterpiece.

The Gameplay:
The gameplay offer a whole new mechanic to the Zelda franchise, that hasn't been seen in an earlier installment. The game does remove some of the more recognizable mechanics such as the Hookshot/Grablinghook, swimming underwater, the Master Sword being overpowered.
- The new mechanics however, are very special! They have introduced approximately +100 melee weapons as well different bows, shields, arrows.
- The Sheikah Slate, which allows you to manipulate with metallic objects, stop time for a single object, create bombs that detonate on your command.
- The Paraglider, which is freaking awesome.
- Shield Surfing, which is freaking awesome.
- Different armor and clothing, which can be upgraded by you know who.
And loads and loads of more stuff.

The weapons break, yes that might seem like a downer - BUT, it gives a whole new ""breath"" (hah), to the mechanics! Like in Ocarina of Time, you can get the Big Goron's Sword, which is so much more powerful than the mastersword, and in the end, is the only sword you'll use. But BoTW's breakable weapons, does not let you get to attached to a specific weapon - you need to plan ahead when you spot some bad guys. Do you want to risk your weapons breaking, or do you scout for other possibilities such as metal boxes, boulders you can push down in their camp, explosive barrels to hit with a fire arrow. The process of planning your next move is key, and keeps one on their toes.

The Story:
The story is not as complex as TP for example. But the thing is, the story is not binding you to a linear path. You don't need the story to defeat Ganon. When you get the paraglider, you can head towards Hyrule castle and try your skills out - You'll probably die. But the game doesn't care what you do, the only one who cares should be you. You explore, unlock more heart containers, get your stamina wheel to the max, find a great horse which makes traveling over the wast fields of Hyrule easier.

I really like this game, although it has some minor irritating parts, I still se it as a masterpiece, which is why I really think, everyone should give it a chance, and believe in the major critics.
Some of the user critics are just salty ;)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
tracer45,15-03-2017,"I've been playing this game non-stop. It's nice to see Nintendo going all out with this game. This is the first non linear Zelda game, and it's definitely nice change. I'm really enjoying the story so far, and I love the new characters. The graphics are really pretty in this one thanks to the beautiful art style. The music is great as well, I might even pick up the actual soundtrack. 10/10 doesn't mean the game is perfect, because the does have some minor flaws, but overall I think the game is amazing and definitely a top contender for GOTY.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
LucvdM,15-03-2017,"I was going to give this game a 9/10 (as no such thing as a perfect game exists), but I went with a 10/10 to counter-balance all those kids who review-bombed this game with 0s and 1s for whatever reason.

TW3 (The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt) used to be my favorite open-world game of all time, but BoTW (The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild) just took that spot. Because TW3 was my favorite open-world game and because I know it's a widely popular game I'm going to use TW3 as a benchmark to tell you in which areas BoTW beats TW3 and in which areas it does not and why I think BoTW is the better game. Just to be direct and frank: BoTW is not going to beat TW3 in any of the follow departments: graphics/aesthetics, storytelling/writing, gameplay and replay-value. I repeat, BoTW is NOT better than TW3 in any of those things.

The graphics of BoTW are unique but kind of bad for a 2017 game. The world doesn't feel as crisp and detailed as the world of TW3. The storytelling... what can I say? it's a Zelda game. Zelda never had amazing storytelling and this game is no exception. The story does what it has to do, and it does it right, but don't expect a deep, integrate compelling story with interesting twists and turns, because you won't find that here (or in any Zelda game for that matter). The gameplay is solid but there are a few minor things that annoyed the **** out of me. Weapons break way too quickly, the few motion-controlled puzzles are horrible (when will Nintendo ever learn, nobody likes gimmicky motion controls! not even in puzzles!) and the amazing physics engine will work against you more often than not).

Right now it sounds like I'm roasting BoTW and think it's a horrible game. I don't. At the start of the review I already said I'd give this game a 9/10 and think it's the best open-world game, better than TW3. And now that I've got my criticism for BoTW out of the way I can explain why I think this is the better game.

What makes this game stand out is that it's truly designed with an open-world in mind. It fully utilizes the concept and in many way redefines what an open-world game ought to be. So many games these days have an open-world. Open-world games seem to be the new flavor of the month (or decade, I guess). Every developer wants their game to have an open-world these days. Yet so few developers do the open-world concept so right!

Many open-world games give you a vast world to explore yet they either feel repetitive or don't really reward exploration at all. Games like TW3 will lead you through the open-world in a linear fashion by constantly telling you where to go next. And when you wander off the beaten path just for the heck of it, you will often find interesting locations which you want to access, but simply can't because you have to pick up a relating quest that sends you there first. The den of the werewolf is always empty, until you pick up the quest to kill the werewolf. The entrance to that secret cave you just saw will always be closed until the main quest tells you to go there. That big griffon you saw on that mountain? You have to be level 25 first before you can beat him, no matter how good you think you are.

This is a problem that many open-world games have, but not BoTW. When you start the game you'll be confined to a small tutorial area (which is actually a really big area, but still just 1% of the world map) where you are given a few tasks which will intuitively teach you the mechanics of the game. Even here you already have some freedom to explore and it's up to you in which order you do these tutorial tasks. Once you got your paraglider, you can leave the tutorial area in any direction you want, going wherever you want, doing whatever you want. At this point you're truly free to explore and play around in a vast open-world filled to the brim with puzzles and secrets. Sure, there are quest markers on your map, but these markers are merely there to show you some of the options you have. They show you what you CAN do, NOT what you MUST do. I understand a lot of gamers need handholding, guidance or prefer a list of task to go through, so I guess these quest markers are there for these types of gamers. But even if you'd just follow the quest markers, you'd still have about 6 options to choose from once you leave the tutorial area. One marker will lead you to directly to the final boss Ganon, one will lead you to Kakariko Village and the other 4 will lead you to the 4 main dungeons of the game, which can be completed in any order, or be skipped altogether. Which of these 6 markers you pursue first is 100% up to you. If you want to go straight for Ganon, you can, nothing is stopping you. If you do, you're going to have to fight your way through a horde of incredibly powerful guardians though, It won't be easy, but it won't be impossible either and the game won't stop you from trying.

And THAT is why BoTW is the best open-world game to date, even better than TW3.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lemonsheep5182,15-03-2017,This game is one of the best Zelda titles you can get! The Wii U version is amazing too.

Atlasz,16-03-2017,"I just beat the game today, i enjoyed it overall and it is an excellent game, however no game is perfect, and I was majorly disappointed with the dungeons and bosses, to me it was an extreme lack of creativity when it came to all the gannon's you fight, they pretty much were all the same just with a different weapon and were very easy, even dark beast gannon was somewhat disappointing, it looked great but only had one attack, the yugi clan basically let you win, and another thing to me that is extremely important to every zelda game, is the music, which when beating the game i had barely any songs that left a heavy footprint, which never happens when it comes to a zelda game at least for me. As a game I give it 9/10, as a zelda fanboy, i give it 8/10",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
juelz,16-03-2017,"Couldn't ask for anything else when it comes to an open world game. Zelda is such a fantastic franchise.
Yet I don't think this game deserves a score of 10. Why?

1: Because it has framerate issues.
2: The voice acting. For some stupid reason, Aounuma decided to go without dual audio. Just a very few of the VA were okay in the english version, but most of them sounded horrible, way too cringy and out of character.

Thankfully, they don't speak that much in the game. But when they do, it's always in an important cutscene. I just don't get it why they wouldn't go for dual audio in such a big, important game like this.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

geminate,16-03-2017,"I have not enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. I love exploring the world, learning skills (like how to cook) by experimenting, trying to catch and tame horses, and how the people and towns feel real (talking to people isn't just busyness). I feel like I am actually on an adventure. My 10 year old daughter also loves this game too and we often talk about the different areas that we have been exploring.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BodManFord,16-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is a entirely new Zelda game with the core mechanics changed and everything is centered around the open world environment. The story of this game is one of the most deep and gripping stories I have ever witnessed. I shed a few tears.
But in order to see this story, you have to find very specific places in this massive world with picture clues. Which is tedious and a chore but it pays off.

The open world design gives the game a completely non linear approach to where you can storm the final boss right after the tutorial area. The world connects very well and the whole map has wasted eggs in the location names and Easter eggs that can be found in game.

The combat is where the game either makes or breaks the experience.
At the start of the game, dispatching foes can be extremely creative (ie putting a balloon on someone and make them float away) and fun, but later in the game that is scapped because of your foes high HP.
Weapon durability can be annoying, but it really adds to the whole ""survival"" aspect of the game and is really fun (to me at least).

One of the main things that puts this apart from other Zelda games is the difficulty. This is not a easy game. It's not too hard either (coming from me though, I've beaten and 100% all souls games). You can easily die without good armor and such. But the non linear world allows for you to wander into end game smokies who kill you with just their glare. And the bosses are just meh. Not too creative and forgettable.

The game runs fine for me, I noticed no frame drops or anything. The graphics are pretty and fun to look at. Minimalistic but detailed. They are cell shaded and it looks lovely

All in all, this is one of my favorite games I've played in a long time.
I give it a 9/10 for excellent story but with tedious mechanics here and there but overall it's a masterpiece",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The world is massive, vibrant and filled with secrets, The combat is pretty fluent in the most part and the game is just a blast to play. Just when i'm about to stop playing, something allures me into playing more. The atmosphere is brilliant and immersive. The voice acting however is not the best but it doesn't hinder my gameplay experience. Rain falls too frequently when i'm climbing mountains making it frustrating sometimes. Framerate drops are an issues that come up from time to time (Wii U Version). Weapons break a little bit too easily as well. Most of my issues with the game can be fixed with a patch so i don't consider them a really big deal. Overall the game is a lot of fun and it will keep you playing for hours or maybe even days.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
clynnc19,18-03-2017,Best game I've played this year. I often got lost in the huge beautiful world and never ran out of things to do or places to explore.

Minaverus,22-03-2017,"This game is a masterpiece and sets the bar for all future open world games that follow. I've never really been into open world type games, because it felt like you had no idea what you were doing or what your eventual goal actually was. This game sets you up from the beginning with a clear goal in mind and from there you just explore and uncover the story for yourself if you so choose to do so. Simply running around this vibrant and beautiful world is a pleasure from start to finish. I never really felt a need to progress the story or get to the next 'checkpoint'. It's a wild world and it begs you to uncover its secrets. What's lying in wait in that next canyon? I wonder if I can glide all the way across and still be able to climb that cliff on the other side? This is what makes the game so special. There is such an attention to detail and physics in this game that it is truly mind-boggling. If you think you can do it, chances are that you can. The sense of freedom is unrivaled in any game that came before it. It's all in the title of the game, Breath of the Wild. Another masterpiece from Nintendo that will endure for generations as one of the most beloved titles in the company's history.

Hollando,18-03-2017,"This game took a while to get into. People seem to be praising the slow start but I like a little backstory to my games. I didn't have an issue with the slow intro to past Zelda games. Once you meet Impa, you begin to piece together what this game is about. There are 4 behemoths that you must take back from Ganon. Over a hundred shrines scattered throughout the land that provide classic Zelda puzzles. A ton of side quests that start off silly but get really cool as you progress through the game. Overall, I gotta say this game is excellent and one of the best Zelda games to date.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I failed a lot into planing what i want to do during all this time, every time something come in front of me and call me, i was suprize 1h after to ask me ""What iwas supposed to do before this ... ?"" and find a way to do it.

Anyways, even after beating the game, I still had PLENTY to do and PLENTY of areas to explore and learn. Story is decent, though not perfect but I feel that the exploration and gameplay aspect was the biggest selling point of this game, and changing the old Zelda system to what it is now is possibly the best choice yet and I cannot wait for the next Zelda game to come soon! Nothing is completely overpowered as it makes you think on how you can get your gears as well as being self-sufficient with your supplies as nothing lasts forever.

Thajocoth,30-03-2017,"After the disaster that was Skyward Sword & the terrible controls of Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks (having to cover the entire screen Link is on with my hand to be able to move around is just a terrible design decision), I didn't go into this game expecting anything. If not for the trailers showing it to be much better, I might not have gotten the game at all. I got the game and found it to be quite good. I had started to grow concerned for the series, but with this amazing game, I no longer feel that way. The open world feels more like the original NES Zelda than any other game in the series, while still being very much its own thing, and this return to the series roots breaks a lot of the conventions that I've had a problem with ever since Ocarina of Time.

Though as someone who enjoys exploration far more than combat, I do feel like the enemies should have far less health than they do. In the original Zelda, fighting a group of blue lynels with the wooden sword was very difficult, but completely possible. Fighting just one with a boko club in this game is simply impossible... But at least the combat difficulty curve isn't based on how patient you can be, like it was from Ocarina of Time through to Skyward Sword, which was a terrible design decision.

The enemies also don't feel very varied, simply because such a large percentage of them are humanoids, which all seem to act pretty similarly. Where are the tektites, leevers, pols voice, & poes? And if you're going to favor humanoids so much, why not a few with play styles that are a bit more different, like the boomerang-favoring goriyas, or the slow-but-tough gibdos and redeads? Thankfully, most combat can pretty much be ignored for those who wish to simply run past it, so I'm not going ding the game on that, but it's a thought to share..

The world to explore is huge without feeling empty like Ocarina of Time's larger areas, or feeling repetitive like most open worlds seem to do. For example, I enjoyed Fallout 3 & New Vegas, but didn't get Fallout 4 simply because I got so tired of staring at a brown screen, and with the same assets everywhere, most places didn't feel unique enough to really remember where what was in relation to one another. Breath of the Wild's regions are colorful and varied, with no areas feeling too samey to one another.

humblenarc,30-03-2017,"The breakable weapons may seem annoying at first, but it makes the combat infinitely deeper than previous Zelda games. It also helps the game's balance. By doing this, it makes you a lot less likely to rely on a single weapon, and will encourage you to save your better weapons for boss fights. The visuals look absolutely gorgeous for only running at 900p. Magnesis, Stasis, and to a much lesser extent, Cryonis all add variety to puzzle solving, exploration, and even combat. The story is simple and straightforward, but the execution is really good. I especially love Princess Zelda in this game. The world feels alive too. The NPCs have their own schedules and special quirks that make them memorable. I do think some of the English voice acting could be better, but it doesn't bother me too much. Honestly, I could go on all day on everything the game gets right but I'll stop here to prevent me from rambling.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

If I had to say maybe I have played about 10 hours of the game so far - but it coud be 20. This is a game where you can just lose yourself, pick a direction and see what there is. There are very few limits to where you can go. This feels to me what Skyrim did not (feel for me)- an open world game where the world feels real as you are playing. Of course there is pop in and slowdown but it doesnt take you out of the immersion.The art style and the very low key music add to that immersion and the enemy AI is crazy good - I threw a bomb at the feet of an enemy monster who promptly KICKED IT BACK to me!.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

UnionJack0714,20-04-2018,"The Legend of the Zelda in recent years has struggled to create a sense of wonder and freedom. The most recent entries are very linear and consistently held the players hand leaving no challenge to the experience. Breath of the Wild is a Van Gogh painting is to art. The game is simply beautiful, the very first moment Link wakes up from his mysterious 100 year sleep players will be treated to a wonderful view of one of the most artistic and well designed worlds ever created. From here the player is cleverly and unknowingly taught everything about the game in the tutorial area The Great Plateau. 1 hour later, and the world of Hyrule is your playground. The world might not look realistic visually, but in terms of nature it is the most realistic environment I've ever seen in a game. Trees host fruit like apples, that can be cut down to get wood, and the wood and be ignited with a piece of flint to cook those apples, and if in a cold environment that fire will keep you warm... everything compliments each other and is truly the beginning of a new survival experience. And the best part is you can do whatever whenever. Even the games story isn't linear, which tells a mysterious tale of Link trying to recover his memories after being defeated in battle 100 years ago. Link will also try and help the main settlements of Hyrule defeat and conquer the four Devine Beasts, which are mechanical animal giants that are being controlled by Calamity Ganon. These act as the games main dungeons, and offer a refreshing change to the predictable Zelda dungeon formula. As well as these, the player is free to find 120 mini dungeons called Shrines. These will offer smaller challenges as well as chance to upgrade your life hearts and stamina. There are also many side missions to complete to earn some extra rupees, weapons, food and rare materials, some are more interesting than others but the rewards proved to be surprisingly useful. There are also many many other things to try out, like upgrading your armour, taming the best horse, experimenting with materials to create the best food, finding all 900 Korok seeds, but some of the best moments come from being imaginative with the games amazing physics. This is not only the best launch title ever, this is potentially the best game ever. This alone is worth buying a Switch for. 10/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Bfreepro417,21-04-2018,"Breath of the Wild is a true masterclass in art direction and game design. Nintendo always delivers, but this past generation has felt a bit like they have been surpassed in sheer scope and scale with the increasing popularity of open world gaming and freedom of choice, and they really needed to cast a wider net instead of simply focusing on games for younger audiences. This game combines elements of all of my favorite games, not only from the past decade but since I started gaming in general. The art direction is absolutely stunning. Instead of focusing on realism, there is a true hand drawn aesthetic, a whimsical feeling as if you are playing an interactive Pixar movie. Don’t let the lack of graphical realism bring you down, as there is also an attention to detail rarely seen in open world games. Fire spreads, lightning strikes you when wearing metal armor, every drop of rain is seen and heard as it falls, every single blade of grass is rendered individually...it may not sound like much on paper, but things like this truly make the world feel like it lives and breathes. It is truly mesmerizing just wandering through the country side, the grass blowing in the wind, your shield rattling as you sprint up a hill, only to find an enemy camp off in the distance. You can run right in, “guns blazing”, yet this sometimes is the last tactic you want to employ, as many of the stronger enemies are capable of one shotting you with ease. You shoot a fire arrow at the red barrel nearby and it violently explodes, sending the enemies flying with incredible (and often hilarious) rag doll physics. You run for the top of the hill, staying out of sight, and chop down a massive tree and push it over the hill upon the enemies, watching as it picks up momentum and clobbers them all. Occurrences like this provide a true breath of fresh air (pun intended) for a franchise as long standing as The Legend of Zelda. Every single surface is climbable. Instead of traditional dungeons, we have shrines scattered across the land containing trials reminiscent of the dungeons and puzzles of the Zelda titles of yesteryear. Familiar characters and races are back, but everything is truly bigger, better, and most importantly, more fun than ever. The world is absolutely massive and contains many environments and a vast array of breathtaking vistas, truly some of the most stunning horizons and colors I’ve ever seen in a game. The atmosphere is second to none, providing nothing short of pure tranquility as you gallop across the rolling plains on your trusty steed, or climb up a snow capped peak to find a hidden shine, and then shield surf your way back to the foot of the mountain. This is a game that must be played to be truly experienced.

There are a few minor quips. I completed the Gerardo Divine beast first. This was easily the most in depth and full fledged area and the most challenging divine beast in the entire game. The rest of the towns and beasts felt lackluster after tackling Gerudo first. Hint: START WITH RITO VILLAGE.
Weapons breaking is a bit annoying, but you get used to it.
Lack of lengthy dungeons and other traditional Zelda elements may throw off longtime fans. No clever boss strategies and the bosses are all a bit similar.

Overall this game is a modern masterpiece and in my opinion must be experienced by anyone who has ever considers themselves a gamer of any kind. It’s one of those games you can pick up and get absolutely lost in, a feeling I haven’t truly experienced since The Ocarina of Time and more recently, Skyrim. I found the most enjoyment just wandering and discovering new areas and gameplay elements. A stunning achievement that is more than worthy of the Game of The Year title, and, quite possibly, one of the top five games of the decade.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

* Yes if the player smiles at the camera and vice-versa (that's too radical I know :D )
* Make Link RUN like in Xenoblade Chronicles X
* Not so much information / Maybe the cooking can become optional-automated?

hassanchop79,01-05-2020,"Don't listen to the Nintendo fanboys, this is not a masterpiece.
This is a great game but has way too much serious flaws. It has no music which was one of the things that made the previews Zelda entries great. The combat system sucks, where the weapons keep breaking after a few hits, the lock on system simple does not work, and the camera is never in the right place. The fact that you need to constantly adjust the camera makes the gameplay annoying.
The story is ok but nothing much. All the main characters you meet seem to have a huge depression on their minds, specially the princess that probably has the biggest depression ever of a character on the history of games.
There is absolutely no character or story development. Just plain old go kill the bad guy and save the princess. It's basically the same story since Donkey Kong back in 1983...
The open world experience is amazing where you can go anywhere you like. This makes you choose different paths and ways to get around. This is the best aspect of the game. The paraglider is an amazing feature.
The puzzles and dungeons are simple and don't have the greatness that previews games had. Don't know why they made this a basic game.
In conclusion, this is a good game. But it's far away from being a masterpiece like the witcher 3, god of war or the last of us. It's a good open world game with a massive map to explore but with bad gameplay aspects, bland story, annoying details and no music.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kinktwink,16-03-2020,"I know a low(er) rating on Breath of the Wild is considered blasphemy in the gaming community, but I'm convinced this game just isn't my cup of tea. I really enjoy games with large, open, sprawling worlds and Breath of the Wild does promise this. However, the world here often feels flat and empty. The enemy encounters quickly became repetitive and boring and there simply wasn't enough to actually do (besides struggle to climb mountains in the rain and complete an obscene amount of similar trials) to keep my interest. The visuals are gorgeous and it was certainly fun for the first handful of hours, but I eventually grew tired of doing the same things over and over again.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ewenr,30-06-2020,"Got this game with my Nintendo switch as a bundle and after all the high marks it received, I was very much looking forwards to playing it. What a let-down.

Havsglimt,14-06-2021,"BotW feels like an indie game developed by a studio that wanted to cash in on what's popular in today's gaming industry, i.e. an open world adventure setting. I hate to admit it but I felt more enjoyment playing the first hour of Genshin Impact than I did trying to trudge through this game.

I honestly cannot for the life of me figure out why everyone loves this game so much. Progression has no red thread that it follows whatsoever, the survival and durability aspects are inexplicably tedious, shrines feel pointless and samey since they barely require any brainpower and are only there to give you farmable tokens so you have something to ""do,"" it takes ages to travel from one place to another, and the world is pretty much dead outside of the settlements with nothing but small, random packs of the same enemies every 5 minutes which makes exploring the world about as gratifying as trying to swim in a puddle of mud. As someone who has played all Zelda games since Link's Awakening, I just cannot see why this game has gotten the cult following that it has. I want to enjoy it, and I've tried on multiple occasions, but I just can't. This is also nothing like Ocarina of Time, like, at all, aside from it being a third person Zelda game, so I have no idea why people are using it for comparison. It's more along the lines of Skyward Sword, both in terms of how it plays and how much of a low point it is in the franchise. While I want to applaud them for trying something new, all this game does it make me wish they never did.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kl4rity,26-06-2021,"„As wide as an ocean, as deep as a puddle.“ Nintendo exchanged handcrafted, unique dungeons which progress in challenge whilst exploring a world filled to the brim with interesting rewards for walking off the beaten path with a samey combat-focused Game without any challenging puzzles and samey enemies copy-pasted everywhere. The Dungeons are not engaging or challenging, neither are the bosses and there is nothing interesting to find in the overworld - no Progression because everything breaks all the time, which also limits the difficulty of the Puzzles. You have all the tools from minute one -> hence the puzzles stay at the same level of complexity the whole game (very low complexity).

I grew up with Zelda, I love it to bits and I think they should have retained more of the design pillars of the original. Instead of engaging 30-50 hours worth my time, I now have 100-200 hours of yet another grindey open-world game.

Thanks but no thanks.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
knightmonkey,29-03-2017,"Have played every Zelda since the first and this is by far the best so far, I'd go as far as saying the best game ever made. An absolute masterpiece of game design.

It's everything an adventure game should be:
- Lots of puzzles to solve
- Lots of secrets to find
- challenging but fair combat
- lots of weapons/shields/bows/food to find and experiment with
- Beautiful graphics
- Great storyline (voice acting could be better)
- Stunning music
- SO MUCH to see and do I don't want it to end

And to top it all off, you can take it with you on the portable Switch screen and carry playing wherever you are.

In my opinion - gaming perfection.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
GrumpyReviewer,17-05-2017,"I give it a 9/10 because Zelda BotW is not a perfect game. It is an ALMOST perfect game, though.

It does feel refreshing to walk into this adventure and make it your own. There are just a handful of tips, clues and tutorials and the rest is up to you. It completely connected me back to the very first Zelda, on the NES, when you would start the game, get a sword and, well, good luck.

BotW follows the same principle. This is YOUR story. Make it your OWN. Discover it, feel it, EXPERIENCE it. You will die a lot, for sure; but you will also be amazed with your discoveries. That´s the beauty of this phenomenal experience. I am loving to play this and I think it was worth it to buy a Switch just to play it. I absolutely love this game and I really think everyone should play it to see for themselves that the hype, the praise, it is all real.

But, like I said before, this is not a perfect game. It has its fair share of flaws. My biggest complain being the weapon durability system. It sucks. It makes me like the game less. Zelda is all about a collection of an arsenal, and to hone your skills around them. This is gone, for good. You get a fair amount of weapons and shields that break just around the corner. I understand the mindset behind this mechanic, but I really feel it hurts the game. If Zelda BotW had a fixed inventory of weapons and items, the experience (at least for me) would be much, much better.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
drlowdon,17-09-2018,"The Zelda series has long been amongst the most famous in gaming but, in all honesty, I’ve only even been a minor fan and actually found the last two console entries (Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword) pretty dull. The overfamiliar structure, that hadn’t really evolved since Ocarina of Time, coupled with the constant hand holding and interruptions of NPCs meant that Zelda seemed to be running out of ideas. How wrong I was……..

Virtually every issue I’ve had with the series of late seems to have been solved. The first example is the excellent tutorial section on the Great Plateau which, rather than trying to explain all the different controls and concepts through dull text, teaches all the basics by simply allowing the player to explore a limited area of the map. Once you gain access to the glider that allows you to leave the plateau things you’ll quickly realise just how big this open world is and guess what? You can go anywhere you want! There’s no artificial restrictions or areas you can’t access without finding a certain item, Breath of the Wild shows you this world to explore and then actually lets you explore it.

One of the main things to discover are the shrines, there are around 300 I believe and completing the tasks inside of each rewards the player with orbs that can be used to increase your life or stamina (which is vital for climbing). Unlike the dungeons in previous Zelda titles these never outstay their welcome as they only take 5-10 minutes to complete for the most part and many introduce completely unique puzzles or concepts. Even better is the fact that many can be completed in more than one way and you’re actively encouraged to think outside the box.

I could go on for pages about all the clever ideas in Breath of the Wild but I’ll finish by saying that, not only does it set a new standard for the Zelda series, it sets a new standard that open world games are going to find it very hard to match.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
makosheva7,29-03-2017,"The most perfect open world experience i have ever played. It is impossible not to get lost in this beautiful world.

While the game overall itself isn't perfect, story was only alright, voice acting was off at times, those are really minor gripes when you think about what this game actually strives for. The main story literally takes a backseat to pure and unfettered exploration. The main and best character of this game is the world. To me, it feels like it's own being. A living, breathing thing. No game has ever made me feel this way about the world, and yes, I've played and enjoyed Witcher 3.

I also didn't mind the weapon durability system at all. The game was also one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played, showing truly that a solid art style can compete or beat realism. The difficulty was also very much to my liking. Punishing if you don't think things through, but rewarding and still challenging when you approach a situation from a better angle.

Speaking of which, every damn thing in this world is connected through the in game physics engine! There are almost limitless possibilities to how you can approach a situation! Think about it! That's like another dimension of freedom itself!

Although I did at times wish there was a bit more music present as most world exploration is filled with mainly ambient sounds, when it did kick in when for example a Guardian was targeting you, or when you reach a town, it was awesome.

You wont find the sensational Zelda music here, well until Hyrule Castle but even then it's drowned out by all the other noises surrounding you, nor will you get the expansive dungeons that have been in every other Zelda game instead you get repetitive looking shrines with a mini puzzle in each one. If you like all the open world games such as Batman Arkham Knight or even Shadows of Mordor then you will find yourself in familiar territory but if your a big Zelda fan, like me, it will probably be a little disappointing and strange.

All I can say is that this IS one of the best games ever created. I am so amazed by it, that I now know that I missed a lot by ignoring Nintendo systems for all these years.

Game feels a bit like Shadow of the Colossus mixed with Dark Souls - the atmosphere is just so amazingly unique, fresh, mystic. Story seems simple, and told exactly just like in SotC, here it is a bit more fleshed out. The game is unbelieveably polished, it never cease to surpirse me - those little details like moments when it starts to rain and if You wield metalic shield the thunders strike you. If it strikes grass it sets on fire. You can throw a bomb into water to kill fishes. Chop the trees down. Or when You try to tame a horse - it acts like a living thing. Link moves so smoothly and realistic. All animations are just simply amazing... Well i cant think of any other words than that - game is just amazing.

snakeDoc,20-06-2021,"It is simply one of the best games of all time after having played it for more than two years, without rushing, and leaving it to mature during times when it was very difficult or you did not have all the time it requires. Curiously, the same thing happened to me with the first Zelda I played in Super nes, another timeless masterpiece.

It is for exquisite palates, to be enjoyed little by little, without being in a hurry to reach the end. Lots of quality content, both children and adults will like it, guaranteed.

The artistic direction is implacable, they look like cartoons, the performance is constant, the motor moves everything with great ease, both in portable console mode and on the dock, although playing it on a 1080p TV is probably the best way, the soundtrack is good It could be better, more epic for my taste, the introduction of the open world is quite a statement of intent on how to do it right. It is not that it is huge, but that there is coherence, that there is always something to do, that it makes sense, something that is very difficult to achieve and that only a select few are capable of achieving. If something could be improved, it is to include in the game mechanics the possibility of playing cooperatively on the same machine or online.

Nintendo, think of the siblings who could play together in this wonderful story of friendship, duty and love. They are very good values that should be taught to the little ones. My 7 year old nephew is enjoying this game, and after having played Mario Odyssey, Luigis Mansion, Super Mario Kart, Animal Crossing and a few more, this is the one he has played the most and the one he liked the most. The pity is that it is a single player game and I see the twin sister who also likes it, but the protagonist is a boy.
Nintendo, puts Princess Zelda or another female character as a co-op protagonist in these types of games.

Fawkboy,07-05-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a great game. It delivered a fun open world sandbox experience better than many other open world games where that is the selling point. It also gave us a slightly different format than many other large open world rpg games which is a great thing. The puzzles are excellent, and exploring is loads of fun, but I don't think it quite reaches the 10 score that everyone is giving it. For one while the world feels very alive there are huge areas of pretty much nothing, really I think the map size should have been a lot smaller so there wasn't these large stretches of boringness. Also while I like the idea of breaking weapons, I think they break waaaaayyy too soon. 5-10 hits is barely anything and thats usually how long a weapon will last. With the speed at which gear breaks the game ends up being largely inventory management, which isn't very fun. Really those are my two big complaints. Other than that this game delivers a unique experience that feels like zelda, and also like a whole new game. I'd say its the near perfect revival to the series. The addition of new abilities like magnesis and time halting are really fun to mess around with and widen the sandbox nature of the game, and besides a few rough patches in highly populated towns or cities, it runs great of the switch.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aridos,28-07-2018,"This game is great, not perfect, but great.
There's no avoiding people have been praising this game left and right as the perfect Zelda game, but it's not there yet.
The game is definitely amazing, what with your really fun open exploration that really IS exploration, and not just moving over a similar spot over and over again that expands endlessly like in other games.
The game forces you to craft accordingly, get rupees and challenge you with some puzzles that include basic puzzle-stuff with physics one. The Shrines are very fun, and challenging, and can really stretch your imagination to pick at some of the more far-out ones, but...
Some are really out there and not really a challenge at all, they're just time wasters- if I know what to do and the game is just fighting against me, this is not fun.
The thing about crafting however is that what you do with each object specifically is buried by text, I wish they'd made it clear what goes in an Elixir, what goes in a regular Stew and what goes in BOTH. Yes, I get that being vague and trial-and-error is suppose to give the sense that you're starting up confused and alone in the world, but... why write it down in the description then? Why not just let the player experiment completely on their own? Don't half-and-half me Nintendo.
The fighting is solid and fluid. However, the controller is clunky and doesn't work well with it. Reaction time has some delay to it that I never got used to even after a long time with the game, and making the crouch button sensitive on the movement was not a good idea because when things get tense and I want to run real fast, I don't want to end up crouch-walking.
The weapon selection in the game is awesome. However, this is limited by two factors- the durability system is bad, and instead of making you slowly refine and select the best weapons in the game and feel like a badass by the end of it, you hoard a few weapons for bosses and use crap ones for the rest of the encounters in fear they'll break. So it's more management than anything.
When you do find a really rare, powerful, awesome looking weapon, and go 'Yes!' you then feel annoyed when you realize the next two enemies you'll use that weapon will end up breaking the weapon and that extra mile you went in the Shrine to get it was all for naught.
The story is there, it makes you feel like these are actually people living in a kind of disjointed world, while not shoving text in your face all of the time, you want to look for lore? Go ahead and read diaries, you don't want to? Then just kill the big monsters and save the world, Zelda? Who's that? I'm just here to slay stuff and get rupees.

The game will often surprise and have fun with you at every turn, and at the same time it'll be obtuse and unexplained at other junctures. It'll try to give you the mindset of experimenting with what you have, and at the same time present you with really limited options or just punish you for trying something out there and the physics, controls and general environment will be working against you.

The game is fun, but the huge potential it has and the fact it has such a trouble fulfilling it because of some really weird choices turns me to give it a less than perfect score... too bad.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
RuiPTG,22-04-2017,"It is a great game and the fact that you can play it portably is mind blowing. In my mind it deserves a 8 because even though i enjoyed the experience, it failed to make me love it as much as i feel like it wants me too. I was hooked for the first 3 weeks but by the end of it i was just craving some Ocarina of Time for the timeless story telling and Don't Starve Together for the open world, survival, and crafting (plus I can play that with a friend).

Espolosin,15-12-2018,"El mejor Zelda de la historia, uno de mis juegos favoritos de toda mi vida como jugador y uno de los que mas me ha marcado.

Este juego es la mayor obra maestra creada tanto por Nintendo y por supuesto Eiji Aonuma, sabemos que Eiji Aonuma es un grandisimo genio de la industria y que a creado obras maestras como Ocarina Of Time, pero este le supera por mucho.

El gameplay es una maravilla, las físicas y mecánicas que se llegan a contemplar en este juego son increíbles, como la climatología, la interacción con objetos, también como afecta el entorno a nuestra jugabilidad, si llueve no podemos escalar, si tenemos frió Link va perdiendo vida...

Son tantos los detalles que se pueden llegar a ver que llega a ser hasta abrumador (en el buen sentido).

En cuanto ha historia si que puede llegar a dar la sensación de ser mas simple que las anteriores, pero no por esto la historia deja de ser una obra maestra.

En este nuevo Hyrule tendremos un montón de misiones tanto principales como secundarias con gran importancia para la historia y que se notan que no están de relleno. Este es el mundo abierto mas interactivo y completo jamas creado, cuando vamos hacer una misión o nos encontramos con alguien por el camino y nos da otra misión que hacer o nos quedamos haciendo tonterías y se nos van las horas volando y sentimos que en todo un día jugado no hemos avanzado nada.

Una banda sonora gloriosa, de las que aunque no estés jugando te dan ganas de ponerla para deleitarte.

Conclusión final, este juego por si solo merece la compra de una Nintendo Switch, es una obra maestra que si te gustan los videojuegos NO TE LA PUEDES PERDER, es el juego que crea una nueva etapa en lo que respecta a los juegos de mundo abierto.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ke3bz,30-05-2017,"Giving the Legend of Zelda a world this big, making it live and breathe then giving you absolute freedom to explore was exactly what the series needed. The story is beautifully crafted to focus on Princess Zelda as you work to regain the memories you've lost over the last century while everyone you run into has heard tale of your exploits even you can't recall. Enemies are numerous and challenging and combat is punishing, versatile and rewarding. Dungeons and boss fights are no longer tied to a linear path of progression or """"Dungeon Specific Items,"" but rather wit and intuition to utilize the tools at your disposal as you analyze the latest block to your progression. Each character has a great backstory and each town carries its fair share of tasks to complete as the player pleases. The game never peaked and always impressed, ending at the Castle and leaving an impression as one of the greatest games ever created.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TatsMcGee,08-09-2018,"This is one of the more polarizing games for me this year. In some aspects this is one of the best games that I’ve ever played and in other aspects, I found it incredibly frustrating. One thing I did discover with this game, I don’t think I’m a fan of Zelda games. The parts of the game that are more traditional Zelda moments, I was not a fan.

There is a lot going on with this game so I thought I would go through and talk about everything that gave me an emotional reaction. The Weapon degradation, on one hand, it didn’t bother me but in another sense. I didn’t love it. Its kind of a cool concept, weapons break and then you got to switch and use a new weapon. It forces you to try new and different weapons but at the same time, it discourages you from using the weapons that you like. If you like a weapon, you don’t want to use because it’ll break and the more I think about it, the less I like that game mechanic.

Shrines, this is probably my favorite part of the entire game. There are 120 shrines throughout the world and on the gigantic open-world map you just have to find them. I like running around the world looking for these shrines and then when you do find one and enter it. That was a lot of fun as well. For the most part, that’s where you get the best weapons and for the most part, its just solve a puzzle and after you solve it. You’re rewarded with an “Orb.” 4 of these Orbs can be converted into another heart or more stamina. Solving each shrine puzzle was a lot of fun, a couple times some of the puzzles left me quite confused and then I’d realize that I was just overthinking it.

In the previous paragraph, I mentioned Stamina. Yes, a Zelda game has Stamina and no it didn’t bother me too much. Normally Stamina is one of my biggest dislikes in a video game. It’s a major reason I stopped playing Nioh after a couple hours. You only lose stamina when you’re sprinting, swimming, paragliding or climbing. The climbing is a big reason why the stamina mechanic exists. Without stamina, you could go anywhere you want in the world and there are some areas you probably shouldn’t visit while you’re still fairly weak.

That really brings up the other aspect of the game that I absolutely loved and that was just exploring the world. Yes, I was running around and opening up the map so I could find shrines but it was a lot of fun just exploring every nook and cranny of that world. Early on, I put all of my upgrades into stamina so it would get easier to explore the world. I want to say at least the first 6 or 7 upgrades went right into stamina. Once I had enough stamina and I felt like I could go anywhere in the world. That’s when I switched to accumulating hearts.

For the most part, I have talked about what I loved about the game but its time for me to rant a little bit. My biggest complaint by far is rain. Rain is this fun game mechanic that makes the game unplayable. If it’s raining then you can’t climb and if you can’t climb then you can’t explore. If you can’t explore, there is no reason to play this game. Now there are options to counteract rain. One is to create a campfire and advance time to when it’s not raining but for that, you have to find a cave or some kind of shelter because otherwise, the rain puts out the campfire. So you have to run around for 5-10 minutes looking for a place to start a campfire. Also to start a campfire you need wood which can be acquired by chopping down which are everywhere and flint. Now flint can be found by blowing up specific rocks. When you blow the rocks up, it doesn’t just spit out flint, you could end up getting other crafting materials instead. Because I’m such a lucky guy for the first 15-20 hours, I never found any flint. So I was able to just skip the rain. So I would have to do the other thing and that was fast travel a different area. Which I remember one day, I turned on my switch, the area I was in was raining so I went somewhere else. That place was raining as well so I went somewhere else and you guessed it, it was raining there as well. At that point, I turned off my system and walked away.

My second biggest complaint was the dungeons. I don’t know what it was but the game had 4 dungeons and I hated them. They just felt tedious and annoying. I enjoyed solving the puzzles in the shrines but the dungeons felt like a step too far and I did not enjoy spending any time in the dungeons.

My final complaint is the boss battles. There was 5 total and 3 didn’t bother me but the other 2 just nearly broke me. I think it’s important to note that I don’t love games where the primary weapon is a sword. I like sitting back and shooting more than stabbing or swinging. Just personal preference. So 3 out of the 5 battles I could do just that. Sit back, fire my arrows, dodge, and dive. I never really got that close but then all of a sudden the last 2 boss battles I couldn’t play the way I prefer.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

LillySatou,07-03-2017,Worth it even with its bugs. I don't care about the random frame rate lag (currently playing on WiiU) I still plan on getting a switch for Zelda BOTW. Probably the most fun I've had in a single player video game for quite some time. Combining Zelda with an open world seems perfect with a small gripe of not being to judge where to go before getting ruined by a high tier enemy. Still only a small price to pay in a huge open world where you can explorer anywhere at any time whether you are ready or not adds to the experience of finding the right enemies to fight or having a tough battle and winning.,9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

preparetosigh,08-03-2017,"I have just completed the first phase of the game (Great Plateau) so I cannot give a truly comprehensive review. However, as someone who has been gaming for 35+ years, I can talk about the atmosphere and basic mechanics extensively.

The mechanics of the game all feel very intuitive. It takes only minor experimentation to figure out things like combat, exploration, and cooking. The open world feel of the game is pretty spot on, with emphasis on exploration and utilizing the highly interactive environment in a very natural way. Trees can be cut down to create bridges, chopped into firewood, or floated in water, boulders can be rolled down hills, boxes can be stacked or broken to pieces, grass can be set on fire, etc.

All of the old combat tricks are still in play, such as locking on, dodging, blocking with a shield, etc., with a couple of new mechanics thrown in. Link can now parry attacks and there appears to be enemy poise/stamina values a la Dark Souls. For example a shield wielding enemy can have their guard broken after successive attacks. The variety of weapons that Link can use, each class having its own move set, and the necessity of collecting drops from enemies to keep your arsenal full creates a new level of depth to the combat systems. It is refreshing to see the Zelda franchise adopting concepts from other modern 3rd person games that lend a more realistic feel to the world. The fact that you can approach any obstacle from a variety of strategic angles puts this iteration a step above past titles in the series where it often felt as though there was a single answer to any scenario and the developers were funneling you into a set course of action. in Breath of the Wild you take on each challenge in whatever way you see fit, applying your own play style and creativity to surmount them. That is not to say that there isn't a 'best' option, sometimes relying on a trick of the environment, but you can also just rush in with sword swinging and knock some heads around if it suits your mood. Ultimately logical and creative thinking, coupled with keen observation of your environment are your best weapons.

To address those reviewers that say the environment is empty and devoid of interesting encounters - well that is simply inaccurate. I get the feeling that those players are looking for a more linear progression with set obstacles thrown in their faces with punishing results for failure. That is all well and good, but that is just not the style of game we are given with BotW. Their dissatisfaction is likely tied to their expectation and approach to games in general rather than any failure on the part of the game itself. Breath of the Wild is a game that you should take your time with. Soak in the atmosphere and stop to smell the roses as you journey through this beautiful world. It takes a little more effort on the part of the player to appreciate everything this game has to offer, more like a Minecraft experience than a Call of Duty festival of fire and blood. When I began playing I quite intentionally avoided the first 'plot destination' and spent a couple of hours touring the landscape and finding as many little secret spots as possible. Go hunting, harvest some plant life, light some cooking fires, climb some mountains, swim through some ponds, and knock some heads around while you are at it. I think if you slow your approach down and don't demand that the game present you with the obvious encounters and plot points immediately you will enjoy your journey all the more.

Now the few thing I am slightly disappointed with...

The Shrines that serve as 'dungeons' so far are slightly too small/short. One of the absolute strengths of Zelda games have always been the dungeons. The complexity of the puzzles and the way that you have to build upon past solutions to progress through them has always been the most satisfying aspect of the games for me. Perhaps they will become deeper and more interesting as the game continues, but for now they are clever, yet underwhelming.

The rewards for overcoming the scattered challenges in the world (like camps of Bokoblin) are also a bit underwhelming. Hidden spots that require some clever thinking or extensive exploration to discover often contain a chest with just a few arrows or a mundane weapon of some sort so when I finally get to pop it open I am left with a bit of a 'meh' feeling afterward. Again, I have only really explored the opening area of the game, so perhaps the rewards will become tastier with some more progression.

I'd like to see some method of repairing equipment that you have found in your exploration. I find that I don't want to use certain weapons at all because I just don't want to lose them for fear of them breaking. Perhaps this will change further in the game.

In conclusion, with minor complaints BotW is poised to become the top Zelda game and one of the best console experiences ever presented.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Now for me I have been a zelda fan since day 1 for the NES, but I have skipped the last few games simply because they did not interest me. Hands down breath of the wild is one of the greatest games I have ever played IN MY LIFE, 35 years of gaming and by far no game has caused me to feel this way. The new features and physics of this game are just insane, along with the difficulty, 1 shot deaths and falling while climbing mountains is just crazy. So this is my review, from someone who has owned every game console ever made, and currently the big 3, this is by far my favorite game of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Death_Hawk,08-03-2017,"Breath of the wild is unlike any Zelda game before it, and yet it is still as true to the franchise and its roots. From the beginning of the game you are dropped into a small portion of the world to explore for yourself, beat the 4 shrines and you're free to explore Hyrule at your leisure. The game is both fair and difficult at the same time, whenever I fell in combat it wasn't some dumb control error or bad ai, it was simply my own stupidity in not strategising or equipping the right weapons. The dungeons, like this game vary from what we have come to know from the Legend of Zelda, gone is the classic 8 dungeons and a boss formula, in its place are 120 Sheikah Shrines, which are small puzzles of varying difficulty which take between 5 and 15 minutes to complete, perfect for playing on the go, or even to kill time at home. The dungeons on the other hand take the form of 4 Divine Beasts, massive ancient robots. These are not messy labyrinths like older dungeons, these are true 3D puzzles that take me around 40 minutes to complete, the bulk of that time is spent trying to find out how the dungeon works. The story is certainly interesting although it is not as deep as the one found in Skyward Sword. The plot centres on Link awakening 100 years after Ganon's invasion of Hyrule in which Link and Zelda failed to defeat him, as you progress through the 40-50 hour story you will learn of the past and the how the many races have coped and recovered falling ""The Calamity"". This game is the new Ocarina of Time, it revolutionises how open world games function offering 100% freedom 1 hour into the game. Despite the noticeable frame drops on the Nintendo Switches ""TV Mode"" I have honestly been having far too much fun to really care about them. Congratulations Nintendo, after almost 20 years you have managed to steal the trophy from Ocarina of Time, The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is not only the best game ever made but will also influence how 3D open world games are played for years to come.

itsfredfuchs,10-03-2017,"A huge step above the previous title; Skyward Sword. Hands down the most I put into any Zelda game, and I didn't expect that at all. I felt compelled to finish any possible side quests and do as much of the side content as I possibly could. This game isn't a solid 10/10 by my standards. Its more of a 9.7/10 But I feel bad giving this game a 9/10 (especially with the Sony and Microsoft fanboys obliterating this game's user score out of butthurt. Honestly the only reason I'm writing this review. If Sony/Microsoft fans can do it, so can we. Its fair.) The world is filled with things to explore. Various different things to fight, various different ingredients to find, a buttload of hidden shrines and puzzles to solve. And of course the main story, which I would argue is one of the more interesting stories in all of the currently existing Zelda lore. I wouldn't consider the story super deep or intricate, but it certainly is extremely enjoyable. Which is about as much as I expect out of a Zelda game. The combat in this Zelda game is by far the best in any Zelda game. There has never been a Zelda game I considered ""difficult"" in terms of combat, and this game is the sole exception to that. In the beginning of the game, the combat is exceptionally difficult, as every bit of health you take can be a deadly amount. As the game goes on, you learn the combat more, and also gain more health, ultimately giving the combat a very fair thing to learn. Of course you gain more benefits from doing the side content to (namely in terms of health, defense, and stamina, as well as better equipment that makes combat easier).

That being said, I do have some problems with it. Namely the main complaint is the shock element. Shock is an insanely broken element when used against you. No amount of shock resistance can save you from it. Another problem I had with it were the gyro puzzles in shrines. I've played this both on the Wii U and the Switch versions, and the Switch does the gyro based puzzles just fine. However, the Wii U version has major issues with the gyro controls. Another problem is that I feel the amount of Koroks is extremely excessive. Supposedly there are around 900 of them. I am fine with the 120 shrines because those are very large structures and the overall reward for completing them is incredible. But with Koroks, you only ever want to find enough to upgrade your melee weapon inventory to hold all the weapons you want. Upgrading the bow total and shield total is ultimately useless as those don't break nearly as often. In short, its not worth finding all 900 of those little schmucks. One final problem I have with the game is that I feel the combat becomes less rewarding as the game goes on. And I found myself wanting more from it after a certain amount of time playing the game.

tl;dr this game is far from perfect, I rate it a solid 9.7 out of 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ginobiliti,11-03-2017,"I've never seen so many troll comments on a meta critic page. I primarily game on PS4 and this makes me a bit ashamed of our community. Clearly this game is fantastic, yet people are so petty that they felt a need to bring the user score down. I picked up a Switch on launch date and have been playing this game since. It's one of the best in years. I'd say that the Critics score is more alligned with the actual game rather than the user score. Apparently, the gaming community is too immature to handle a gaming rating system.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
gnorfnorf,17-03-2017,"This game is good. Great. If you have the Wii U (because if you already have a Switch you most certainly have this game) get it. My belief is that someone's opinion is theirs, and it's not anyone else's business to go up in their face and say that their review is based on bias and/or stupid. It's easy to think that this game cheated its reviews by bias, and is actually t r a s h. In this review I will mainly just be talking about the things that lower this game to a 9 for me (I would make it maybe like a 9.2-9.3 but Metacritic hates us). #1 - Weapon deterioration. Now, this would be better if it was like FE, where it shows you how many uses you have left, or if the weapons were better than the plastic Master Sword I got at a costume shop (it's awesome btw). #2 - The final boss. Most of the game has been hard, but the final boss (and the other bosses besides Thunderblight) is easy. As someone who learned how to perfect guard this boss fight was super simple. Maybe if they left out the part where the Divine Beasts lowered his health to half, it wouldn't've been so bad. #3 - So, this isn't as much as a gripe, but just something I really didn't like and thought was a heavily missed opportunity. In the Switch presentation trailer, it had this AWESOME music backing the trailer up and got me super hyped for the game. But sadly, I haven't found it anywhere in the OST. Maybe it's being saved for the DLC in the holiday, but I WISH it was in the OST now. It's so gooood. #4 - y cant u pet doggo he is so cute #5 - Framerates are just annoying. People said it occured only around the beginning area and places like that, but it happened much more than that. Handheld mode doesn't have as much problems, but in places like Korok Forest or Kakariko Village where a lot of NPCs are around, the game chugs hard. And yes, I know the team was alerted of this game being ported to the Switch a year in advance, but maybe a bit longer in development or a patch could make this game a whole much better. And part of it isn't really Zelda team's fault. The Switch is barely able to run a Wii U game because of its hardware, and that's not really the Zelda team's wrong-doing. #6 - Finally, the lack of tunes that we can really recognize and remember was annoying. Besides the main theme, there's not really any other song I can remember off the top of my head, and yes, I know the lack of a lot of music was because of the atmosphere they were going for. Anyways, there aren't a lot of songs like Midna's Lament or Hyrule Field that you can easily remember. If they added the song I talked about in #3 this wouldn't be much of a problem for me. So these are the reasons I didn't give this game a 10. I still think that if you have a Switch or a Wii U (or a good PC, since I heard a Cemu version is being developed), this game is a must-have. Yet, there are some problems that make the experience a bit less fun that of what I had expected. I like this game a lot, and I hope you don't think that a bit of annoyances make me hate this game.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SirMrSwag,19-03-2017,"9 de nota (Le pondría un 9.7 si se pudiese, pero no un 10 ya que no creo en el juego perfecto).
Venga va tengo que decirlo soy nintendero, aunque me crié con consolas de Sony (PS1 y PS2). Hago mi primera review porque estoy harto de que gente sin haber jugado o ni PROBADO el juego coja y le ponga un 0 de nota. Ni el Zelda ni el Horizon (que fanboys enfermizos de ambas partes se tiran basura sin sentido) se merecen ni un 0 (y ni un 10) y le pido a Metacritic que mejore sus reviews de usuario o se cargarán a este sitio web. Pero sin más dilatación... anal, comencemos.
""El aliento salvaje"": Este juego desde el principio te guía y no le das mucha importancia a lo que ves a tu alrededor... solo sigues el camino como quien dice (ya saben como los demás Zeldas)... pero hay un momento donde te dan libertad absoluta y hasta esa lucecita que ves al fondo te llenará de curiosidad... y ahí es donde vez el maravilloso mundo. Todo te picará de curiosidad, hasta cuando cocinas (yo en lo personal cada vez que cocino me entusiasma mucho ver la nueva comida que voy a desbloquear; por cierto les recomiendo juntar 5 trufas milenarias ya que te dan una comida chetadísima), también sentirás curiosidad por ver que hay más allá (es más les recomiendo que paseen por todo Hyrule que yo la vez pasada me encontré en el lago Hylia un dragón de electricidad que salía del propio agua, que ya me olvidé su nombre por cierto, y por el noroeste, en un cañón, hay un dragón de fuego que si mal no me equivoco se llama Eldra... y eso que los descubrí sin estimármelo, así que ya imaginareis mi asombro). Y mucha gente dice que a esta Hyrule le falta vida y no es así; ya que tienes condiciones climáticas que te dificultarán o facilitarán algunas actividades (como llover que te hace resbalar mientras escalas).
""No es necesario el DLC"": Hay misiones secundarias de todo tipo y unas ""Pruebas heroicas"" que son más complicadas. Y por resolverlas te darán nuevas armas y hasta nuevas vestimentas.
""¿Un Zelda sin buena banda sonora?"" Esto es cierto por parte.... el juego no tiene una banda sonora digna de Twilight Princess; pero yo creo que hicieron esto así pera que puedas escuchar el sonido del entorno y que el juego tenga más inmersión (osea que te sientas como el protagonista de la historia)... como el de la lluvia, pisadas de Link en el pasto, los pajaros trinar, los perrros aullando cuando mueren (no la verdad este no me mola mucho). En Switch se escucha mejor que en WiiU eh.
""El legado de Zelda"": A decir verdad este juego no rompe con lo básico del juego, osea es más de lo mismo, (y con lo básico me refiero a que Zelda necesita de Link para derrotar a Ganon) pero si han cambiado algunas cosas... como implementar a los campeones (con sus ""bestias divinas"" respectivamente) y que Link haya despertado luego de 100 años.
""La inmersión es lo primero"": Esta es la parte en donde me luzco. Mientras vayas progresando en el juego irás conociendo a cada campeón y sus pasados contigo... Al principio del juego te dicen que todos los campeones están muertos (luego del cataclismo claro) y a ti te dá meh... porque no los llegaste a conocer... pero conforme vayas descubriendo el pasado de cada campeón te vas encariñando más con ellos a tales puntos como el caso de Mipha, que ella es (porque su espíriu sigue vivo) una preciosísima princesa zora y campeona... que estaba enamorada de ti (de Link no de ti eh) y ella era muy dulce y cuando al final hablas con su espíritu se alegra por verte de nuevo y te jura que ""SIEMPRE TE PROTEGERÁ"", y esa parte del juego es tan melancólica que me puse a llorar durante 10 min. en serio; con Revali, sientes cierto odio por su egocentrimo; con Urbosa sientes seguridad y confianza, ya que es una gerudo muy fuerte y muy apuesta y con Daruk, sentirás confianza y optimismo, por la manera en que te habla... y con Zelda... al principio no te cae bien... pero resulta ser una dulzura de princesa que solo está desesperada por ayudar de alguna forma. Pero si bien tienes muchos sentimientos con los personajes secundarios, estos son desaprovechados en la historia principal y no barajaran (influenciarán) de ninguna manera la historia.
""Eventos inesperados"": Este juego esta lleno de minieventos inesperados... como en la aldea Kakariko, que Apaya (la nieta de Impa) cuando llueve entra corriendo a la casa y te dice que le gusta el sonido de la lluvia, ya que la relaja (por cierto cada vez que acabes con una bestia divina ella va escribir algo nuevo en su diario, y ella te ama en secreto jeje) y así hay más.

PD: Estoy enamorado de Mipha, Zelda lo quieran o no tiene un culazo y es una dulzura y Link esta tobueno (y eso que soy hombre xD). Me pueden seguir en Twitter e Instagram con mi mismo nombre. Ha sido un placer.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

JaymTime,25-03-2017,"Estamos ante el renacer de una legendaria saga de videojuegos. Durante décadas he jugado a varios de los títulos de esta saga y creo sin duda que este se ha vuelto mi favorito y explico el porqué.

Tras más de 40h dedicadas al título, puedo decir que los juegos de The Legend of Zelda pecaban de linealidad total en todas sus pasadas entregas, es decir, ve al punto tal, consigue el arma cual, mazmorra, mazmorra, jefe y empezar de nuevo. BOTW rompe completamente con esto y ofrece un mundo abierto real, donde no hace falta hacer las mazmorras salvo que así lo desees, aunque finalmente si quieres vivir la historia del juego deberás pasar por ellas.

Vivimos en un momento donde los juegos, y sus notas, se miden en resolución y FPS en vez de medirlos en lo que realmente cuenta, vivencia, experiencia, transmisión de emociones, y si, es cierto, Zelda no va tan si quiera a 1080p y no corre a 60fps, pero es que da completamente igual una vez te metes en el juego, el apartado artístico es el mejor que he visto en años, los sonidos, los detalles, la jugabilidad impecable, la grandeza que se siente y es que nada más empezar te empiezas a sentir parte de Hyrule, esta vez de verdad, por primera vez he sentido la necesidad de salvar el Reino y esto me ha mantenido horas y horas pegado a la pantalla.

Being free to do anything you want almost from the get go is what makes this an amazing experience. Whenever I think, ""maybe I can do this.."", I can! And there are so many small details that just made me fall in love with this amazing world.

I was not expecting to be saying a week into having a Switch that it has one of the best games of all time.
At launch I was sceptical too because of all the fan hype and critics reviews being so damn high, but after completing it once and then restarting to 100% the shrines, side quests and more I have fallen madly in love with this game.

zorakid,29-03-2017,"I'm giving this game a 10/10 not because it is without flaws, but because it has exceeded expectations in such a way that minor flaws can be rightfully forgiven.

Breath of the Wild is setting a new standard for open world game mechanics, the same way Ocarina of Time set a new standard for 3D adventure games when it came out.

Links movements, running, jumping and especially climbing provide a very fluid, responsive and organic sense of control for the players. Never has exploration been this intuitive and accessible when the player character is given this freedom of movement. This is solidified by a large game world full of content that rewards explorations.

The combat is fun and challenging, especially early to mid game. It becomes easy, even exploitable late game, but that's the inevitable results of us gamers being ever so skillful and crafty. The weapon durability system serves the purpose of resource management gameplay. But I can see how it could've or should've been implemented better to be more fun and less annoying.

Calibretto9,05-04-2017,"BotW is a truly phenomenal game, but it's by no means the perfect game the press makes it out to be. There are so many fun and intriguing things to do in a beautiful and full world. It's chock full of Nintendo's signature charm, and despite spending 75+ hours in game, I'm constantly thinking about getting back.

That being said, the game suffers from framerate hitches on Switch (a patch improved but didn't remove this issue), an absolutely horrible item durability system, underdeveloped UI around items and inventory management, and a slow and unguided start that could bore players before they got into the meat of things.

I wonder how I'd feel about the game without my preexisting love of Hyrule. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend the game to someone, but it'd come with some ""things you should know"" tips.

molkom,17-04-2017,"I started playing games in 1986 and still remember my feelings of awe when seeing The Legend of Zelda for the first time at a friend's place. I would nag at my parents and after almost a year finally got that beloved golden cartridge myself. I remember drawing maps, talking with my friends to share secrets of where to burn bushes and blow up walls. The sense of adventure was palpable. (The only experience that came close back then was possibly Metroid.)

Since then I've rarely had the same feeling of wonder and discovery again, if ever. Until now.

FYI, I really liked Final Fantasy VII & IX, Pro Evolution Soccer, Wipeout 2097 and many versions of Assassin's Creed so you know a bit more about my game taste. I never finished Majora's Mask (loved the town with its quests but didn't really fall for the rest) or Skyward Sword (too little time on my hands). So my full Zelda experiences have been LoZ, AoL, LttP, OoT, WW and TP plus the handheld versions. I've never been in the camp of ""OoT is the best game ever"". In fact, my opinion - after LttP - has been that Zelda games are good to great games but not outstanding (while outstanding in their craft, not outstanding for my enjoyment). With BotW I expected more of the same. Boy was I wrong.

This game captures that childhood sense of wonder once more. That sense of adventure, exploring the unknown, along with trepidation for what might be around the next corner or mountain top has kept me on my toes. Many say the story is not good, but I love the story and how its pieces fit together like those of a great puzzle. From finding clues about main characters' feelings in books to flashbacks from the past, it all becomes a coherent whole. Of course, if you don't go exploring you will miss out. But to me the whole meaning of the game is exploration so well done.

I am now 100+ hours in and have done almost all I can do in this game and must commend the devs on how they have built learning and stronger weapon drops and enemies cleverly into the game. However, I would like to point out the following things that I really would have liked to see in the season pass expansion and that were lacking from this game:

- somewhere to train your combat skills to upgrade them. I've always loved the feeling of meeting a master somewhere and getting to learn special combat moves throughout the game. (Btw, please include the super cool wind waker move of jumping over an enemy and attacking while doing so ;) Just because it's a semirealistic world you've put us in please don't deprive us of cool combat moves, though kudos on bow slow motion move - love that)
- more hard to beat human-like enemies like those cool knights in other 3D Zeldas (I think in the end of both OoT and Wind Waker you meet knights in armour that are tougher to beat without special moves.)
- a city filled with throngs of people and stuff to do - maybe set the season pass to play out some years after BotW (where you can go all Majora's Mask and Assassin's Creed on missions ;) - minus the over the top violence to fit the Zelda series)
- maybe above all, more/cooler bosses. Might just me my preference, but I much prefer ""non-scifi"" bosses like big dodongos, three-headed dragons, spiders that look like spiders, all human forms of Ganon (Ganondorf), Shadow Link and such that require well timed moves and skills.

With that said, this game has given me more enjoyment from a game than I've had since those childhood days. I can't give it bigger praise than that. Thank you for this experience.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
pdaz,15-04-2017,"This is a game that above all else rewards Zelda fans. It receives a 10/10 not for being a flawless game, but for being everything I could have conceivably asked for in a Zelda game. I still play the original Zelda games from time to time, I have sunk more hours in Link to the Past than most games I've played in the last few years combined. I am not even going to go into Ocarina. For people like me atmosphere is everything, gameplay is important in-so-far as it helps me stay immersed. Gameplay shouldn't be the end all and be all of a game, it should be responsive and smooth and enjoyable enough so as not to detract from the real reason I play games: to feel like I am in a different world. With Breath of the Wild Nintendo nailed what nostalgic gamers loved about sitting up til 4 am playing a SNES or N64 classic. They really listened to their fans and gave them a game that will transport you to a different world for dozens of hours. I lost track of time playing this and cannot recommend it more.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

marlick25,17-04-2017,"I never played any Zelda games before, in fact I never had any of Nintendo consoles. I bought Switch because I think it would suit me as I rarely have the time to play games in front of a TV (had a PS4 before switching -- pun intended -- to Switch).

Oh boy did I not regret the decision at all! This game is superb! I wouldn't consider myself an avid gamer, because most of the time I only play Fifa. I dont enjoy another types of games as much as Fifa. The final game I played on PS4 was Digimon World Next Order, and I didn't even want to play games like GTA5 or Uncharted 4 or even Bloodborne despite most of them being on sale on PS Store.

But this Zelda game is different, at least to me. First time I played it, I couldnt stop playing and I tried to find time (even 1 minute will do) to play it whenever I can, be it on a train, waiting for meals or even in toilette! (not recommended to do this)

Too many people have said what is needed to say, and I just want to say this: this is a game that suits almost all type of people. You can go slow, spend all your time exploring the world and not be bothered by the main story, or you can just go straight up face Ganon after you finish the first 4 Shrines. There isn't wrong or right, you can just do anything that you want to do. Personally, I relish fighting Lynels, though it have been a little boring to me because I know too well their attacks and how to deal with every single one of them.

Jurassic16,17-04-2017,"Breath of the wild is my first zelda game ever. Although as already become a game to remember. The story is immerseful and one of the best stories that has ever been told in a game. Finding your memories is the best part. You learn about Link's past through memories.

Danz0r77,19-04-2017,"Anyone who has given a < 10 score for Breath of the Wild has either not played it - or has only played it for a few hours. The sheer size of the game and amount of content is staggering. Almost beyond words.

I've been playing for roughly 75 hours now and I still feel there are large areas of the map I've not even scratched the surface of yet. I've found around 100 korok seeds out of a total of 900. i can't even begin to imagine where the other 800 are hidden.

I can climb a random mountain or swim to the middle of an anonymous looking lake and I'll be given a new side quest to take on. I set out on the side quest and, 3 hours later, after being sidetracked by who knows what... I may get around to completing it.

I just cannot quite get my head around the insane weight of unique, interesting and challenging content in this game. I've played many open world games over the last 10 years or so and none of them come close to the variety and sense of wonder that BOTW provides.

If I was forced to say something negative about the game, it would probably be the soundtrack. It's OK, but it doesn't blow you away.

+ the design receiving freely player's proceeding including direct-path to the Last enemy
+ Beautiful grasses styled in paintings
+ Terrains fit its game-system
+ its story offers many to enjoy
+ Coherent smoothed events and player-upgrades
+ Perfection is high each for battle scene.

Weak Points
- Zelda also means Large dungeons...but not found
- seemed some copied features from (locally) Japanese Major titles especially in pre-published in 3DS-contents like SMT4,Fantasy Life Link, US-style open-worlds and so on.
- too large maps and meaningless its distances(especially in free-to-warp shrines) as in a game system.
- and separated Enemy's area and AIs.""open-worlds"" applied only in player's travel.
- Roughly enemy's re-spawning system and in-game economics management automatically.Lack of enemies and re-spawned all suddenly.
- Some contents belonged to so called ""fake"" old-standard Japanese Villages as like Studio Ghibli worked previously
- its story offers a little to learn.
- The Concluding : A lot of works and developers generated A bit of an originality.
- Overpriced within a based Nintendo Switch.

The most captivating with this game, it let you experiment the various physic within the game. From the start it let you experiment with the various mechanic of the game, if you love open world games like elder scroll series, this is one game that you should try. After the tutorial area, you basically could go anywhere and do anything. To have a greater experience, do not look the Internet for walk-through, hints or tips, rather find it your self, this will keep your experience to the maximal satisfaction, as the game basically force you to think creatively and open to new idea.

Combat is brutal yet fun, story is not too special but has a nice mystery to it. Characters aren't much to write home about but slightly memorable.

The ending felt good, after defeating Calamity Gannon which is a test of the skills you learned at the divine beasts you get to fight Dark Beast Gannon which is both easy and intense. Dark Beast mostly focuses on Archery with Calamity focusing mostly on Swords and Shields. Even after I beat Gannon I still had things to do and I plan on getting the expansion pack via the Nintendo E shop soon.

han0430lee,03-05-2017,"This is the 2nd zelda game I've tried since the first experience, which was The Phantom Hourglass (NDS game)
I saw some zelda games trailers and gameplays a little but didn't really interested in. Phantom Hourglass was not bad but it didn't make me totally into it more than pokemon.
So, I tried this game by suggestion of friends and people online, and that was when this game received 100 score of metacritic.
I played Witcher Wild Hunt before trying this game so, didn't liked graphics and styles much at first.
However, this game has really good balances between enemies and player character. Also, lots of things to do and lots of place to travel.
Map size seemed small at first glance but, you will find that this games whole map size is really huge as I started to compare with Witcher Wild Hunt when I activated 2 towers.
I loved GTA5 and Witcher Wild Hunt but, couldn't find such games that have lots of things to look, to do, as well as well balanced system like them.
Now this game is one of my top 3 games which I really enjoyed, and love and would suggest to anyone who's looking for fun games.
These 3 games can give you what open world game really means as well as what a 'game' truly means.

Three, it does not have padding, many open world games have alot of padding to make the world feel vast, but I feel like this game had a good amount of everything.

ToastyGhos,17-05-2017,">A beautiful thing about this game is that you can set your own difficulty, you can go straight for the big bad guys like a Hinox or a Talus or a Lionel or you can do other stuff like explore or train a horse. The entire story line is open as soon as you jump off the Great Plateau. You don't get very good weapons at first so its hard to do much significant stuff. You find better weapons by exploring farther areas of the map or beating more powerful enemies. The music is very subtle and slow and only changes when you enter new areas like cold regions or villages. I thought the story was typical and over all not that interesting. The voice acting was sloppy and dialog wasn't any better than previous Zelda games but the final boss fight and ending was well done and the game play was very smooth during the whole sequence. The game play in general was very fun and interesting full of cool little physics things like fire making an up-draft that can be used to fly up, things tumbling down hills, metal and water conducting electricity. The world is HUGE its like the size of Ocarina of Time times 150! The sights you can see from on top of a mountain or tower are truly astonishing. The Gibli style animation is beautiful. All the little things and details you can see give you this overwhelming feeling that you’re never going to find everything.

Praesto,18-06-2017,"Overall I rated the game a 10/10 because the developers tried something new and it worked well. Most of my review is going to be critiquing the reviews of the people who gave a negative rating.

Do not get turned off by all of the negative reviews bashing the game because it's not an Ocarina of Time remake. This game has changed a lot, and I believe it's a move for the best.

The lack of heart containers has made, what looks to be 1,201 people mad. Well I have to say I really like the system they implemented to get hearts. You have to solve puzzles that are hidden around the world to get spirit orbs. Four spirit orbs can give you heart piece. What all the haters don't realize is a spirit orb is essentially a heart piece itself, just like in the older games you need 4 spirit orbs (heart pieces) to have 1 complete new heart. It's the exact same as the old games except that you take 1 extra step.

The weapon structure is a lot different. Here you have weapons with durability which make the game feel more realistic. I actually think it feels more ""Zelda-esq"" because of the environment. The Master Sword is NOT breakable like many of the negative reviews indicate, it simply needs to recharge after a certain time and that time is very short.

Some of the negative reviews complain about the ""lack of dungeons"" but many Zelda games only have a few main dungeons. A great example includes Majora's Mask. There are 120 shrines which include puzzles that without a guide can be difficult. These shrines provide all the puzzle you would need for the game while the wilderness provides all the fighting you would need.

Enemies are not necessarily difficult to kill, however Link can die very easily. Certain monsters can nearly 1 shot kill you even at a high enough number of bars. Obviously as the game goes on you get stronger but I like the difficulty.

Traveling in this game is extremely easy. You can tame wild horses, or travel to any one of more than 130 locations on the map instantaneously across all the zones.
Overall this is a great game to play and a great addition to the Zelda franchise. It is a deviation from the tried and true Zelda games and I believe it is a move in the right direction. Some people may not like it but it is FAR from a waste of money. In the case that you like the direction they took the game you will be extremely happy. In the case that you do not like the direction the game is still well worth its money.

With all that said, I also have some gripes but there is no game I feel is perfect either. Initially it took some time getting used to the freedom the game gives you, I hated this at first but really enjoyed it after several hours of play. Also the Master Sword takes a while to get to without a guide and I rather have it as quick as possible. Lastly I was frustrated with the difficulty at fighting enemies at first, but this also goes away quickly as you learn the game.

I hope they release additional Zelda games similar to this. I would continue to buy the game immediately.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheRum,20-06-2017,"Nearly everything about this game is incredible. Nintendo has made exploring fun with you constantly thinking and wanting to know what's over that hill or in that forest. The best thing is that there always is something there!
Bad points for me are the bosses, quite bland.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
pdxrains,30-06-2017,"I'm a huge Zelda fan, as are most people like me who jumped up and down in excitement at the idea of new Zelda game that was...gasp...Open world! It's a big departure from the franchise in a lot of ways, but it does not disappoint (much). Bottom line is this game will keep you rapt for MANY hours of play time and has a TON of content to offer in the form of places to explore, enemies to fight, puzzles to solve, and side quests. I won't ramble on, but I would like to touch on the hits and misses of this game:

Hits:
1) Open world. Map is huge and beautiful
2) Graphics. Beautiful, realistic yet very ""cartoon"". Fits perfect for the game.
3) Game play feels very open-ended and not boxed in like most other Zelda titles, though there are definitely easier and harder dungeons. If you try to go for the Gerudo area in the beginning with 3 hearts, for example... well good luck to ya!
4) Combat systems and controls very good. Aiming the bow and arrow by tilting the controller in 2 axis works amazingly well. Controller has 3 axis gyros which will be used in some of the puzzles.
5) Many hours of game play in the main quest + side quests. Probably 40 hours on the short end and 80+ if you have your fun with it.
6) Climbing ability is awesome and very freeing. No more awkwardly hopping up slopes of mountains like Skyrim (man that sucked, right?!).

Misses (and these are big misses!):
1) Weapon durability is LUDICROUS. Like, I don't even know how this part made it past testing. Some of the bows wear out and explode after shooting 5-6 arrows.. Seriously? The melee weapons generally last 1-2 enemies, which is just over the top. It's just plain frustrating and annoying having to constantly be throwing away weapons and finding new ones, especially when the fancy ""powered up"" weapons break hella quick.
2) Lightning physics. In some areas, lightning storms happen like ALL THE FREAKING TIME and will destroy you. I went out of my way to get the ""Rubber Tights"" (LOL), which are supposedly electro-resistant and a lightning hit still sucks 10 hearts or more out of me and makes me drop my **** Also, if you're in the sky on your paraglider, you can get struck by lightning. Physics 101 fail. No ground, no electricution. Derp.
3) Where the hell is the iconic Zelda music? It's so sparse. You only get music maybe 10% of the time. Feels like Nintendo rushed this title out and skimped on soundtrack.
4) Nintendo has done away with hearts, but you cook your meals... Ths is cool, but they also allow you to shoot completely innocent animals and eat them, as it, for example, shows a little icon of a beautiful fox turning into a steak. WTF, Nintendo... This is not very Zelda IMO. It's a fantasy world. We need not bring the ugliest aspects of humanity into it.
5) Related to point (4), docile animals like does (that's a female deer for those not in the know) will run and charge at you when startled and sometimes hurt you and knock you down. Major fail. That's not how things work. Deer are afraid of people. They will run away. It's like Nintendo is trying to make it easier for disturbed little children to go out and torture the neighbor's cat after a session of gaming.
6) The dungeons are a bit repetitive. Find the sometimes-annoyingly hidden ""terminals"", activate the devine beast, fight a Ganon variation, have a snack, move on.
7) Koroks to find everywhere, but no payoff. There's apparently literally HUNDREDS of them. I've found like..... 15..... accidently. Woot. Or not.
8) Graphics choke up bad sometimes. Not a lot, but when they do it can be BAD, like locked up or dipping to sub 1 fps in a combat. No bueno for a new system.

Hope that sums it up. If you have a Switch, of course buy this game. Don't even think twice about it. Play it, enjoy it, and hope Nintendo fixes some of this crap in the next round. I'm not giving this game a 10 though, as way too many have. It's not perfect. It's a damn good game though. I'm settling squarely on 8.0, though I'd say maybe more an 8.5 if I had decimal capabilities on here.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
somanymatts,23-07-2020,"This game is practically perfect, outside the lack of gauge for durability of your weapons. All valid criticism of the game pales in comparison to the issue games on more powerful consoles are full of. Zelda: Breath of the Wild is almost “trolling” the competition with a vast map to explore, where hunting for stuff is fun and can allow for casual game play that is fun and extends the time you want to play around in the “playground” Nintendo delivers. Enemy AI and toughness scales well, with the only negative being weapons breaking easy early on, which just gets you to take a more proactive approach to using the map market features, and quick travel to shrines, after each Blood Moon to hoard up on stronger, more durable, weapons.

I’ve put 65 hours in to the game so far and have almost 90 shrines and it is still the main game I enjoy playing to relax, over any other game released since Breath of the Wilds release.

Other developers should take note of how Nintendo leveraged animation to overcome the lack of compute power compared to the PS4/5 and X Box One and Series X because I am in no need to rush into next gen when a game as good as this exists.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

mcsw712,12-08-2018,"Best game of this hardware generation. Hands down. Redefines what open world should be. Not my greatest Zelda game due to lack of orchretral music throughout, traditional dungeons, and the story is kind of lacking. But the gameplay is so far beyond anything I've ever payed. 250 hours in and I'm still going back.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Daniel_64,22-02-2019,"The legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is one of the greatest games I have ever played. The controls and gameplay are some of the best I have ever seen. Botw was the first Zelda game I had ever played due to me not knowing much about the franchise but due to it getting such great reviews I decided to pick it up. I was not disappointed whatsoever. The gameplay is stellar, the world is full of puzzles and hidden NPC quests for you to complete and you are constantly finding new and exciting things. The story is quite shallow but however for what the game is about (exploring a destroyed kingdom and its remains.) the story fills its purpose. Botw was such an excellent game it managed to make me play skyward sword (it’s predecessor) and I am going to buy the Newly announced Links awakening remake.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
RededTip,22-01-2019,"Legend of Zelda breath of the Wild is an amazing single player experience that must not be skipped on. Even thought it isn't perfect in every aspect (no game will ever trully be), this game makes you engage in everything you do, from killing nasty moblins to the vast cooking options you have. The world physics are the best ever seen in any game to date. But what really makes this title stand out from all other open world competitors is the cheer amount of freedom you have. Since the first time you step out of the Shrine of Resurrection nothing tells you how you are suposed to play the game. You have to figure it out yourself, with some very cleaver and smart clues hidden across the ""tutorial"". After you complete this ""tutorial"", the game advices you to go to a certain place, but nothing holds you back to just sprint immediately to the hyrulle castle and try to save Zelda.

The down notes I have are minor, but they add up. First up, I loves the fact that we had voice acting, but in the english version there seemed to be something off with the voices sometimes. I would also like to point out that even thought I had a lot of fun with the shrines in the game, they seem to become a bit repetitive due to the lack of different art style in them.They all feel the same. The last negative point is one that a lot of people might not agree with, but I consider the 4 main dungeons (the Beasts) quite tedious. They felt weird and, again, they all had the same art style. I would have loved the salamander to be filled with lava walls and fire stuff, maybe some new fire enemies. The fact that all the bosses were pretty much the same doesn't help. And , besides the gerudo one, they were way too easy. I would have loved, for example, if we had to have fought the dead champions to free them because gannon had gained control of their body. Or fight a real salamander in the lava one, a real camel monster in the gerudo one, something along those lines.

Concluding, this game is an absolute masterpiece, not perfect, but not too far. I can't wait what nintendo does with this concept it shows so much potencial.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dinko137,03-02-2020,"One of the greatest games ever made. I love every minute playing it. It boasts a vast, beautiful world and yet it never feels empty. Every nook and cranny has something interesting to be found. I recommend this game wholeheartedly.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
justagamer91,29-11-2017,"I'm not hating on botw in any way, i have played and beaten it. so i'm just nitpicking on what they could've spent more time on...its a great game, and its fun in its own right.
Breath of the wild takes everything you know about the Zelda franchise and basically throws it away, only having some parts being in there. and ill be honest here, everything can be new (like open world, etc) but don't completely change to where its unrecognizable. being a sucker for the past zelda music i was put off by how they composed this game's music, in my opinion only a few scores were good. The enemy variety is rinse and repeat and its limited on the kinds of enemys, there are no actual dungeons, there are so many missed opportunities its kinda sad they didnt think of certain things. but this game is worth your time despite its unfortunate flaws",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Sandzyboy,29-11-2017,"first of all, lets get this out of the way, botw is not a masterpiece nor a utter terrible game, like most reviews. I have mixed feelings for the game and I wish to make the most accurate review as possible, and split up the review into sections, so this may be long. I played a lot of this game and also finished all of the shrines. But at the end i'll list ratings of each section like music or difficulty. So with that background lets start.

- Music -
the music in the game is very, very, very limited. There is so much music missing from the game. Most of the time its just random keystrokes or a quick jingle. Wish there was more music in the game. Although my favorite song in the game is the castle theme. The Castle theme is really good, its super epic going to hear it for the first time and listening to it over and over on YouTube.

- Story -
TO LITTLE STORY. Can't stress it enough, here is the basic rundown of the story. You wake up mysteriously hearing Zelda guide you though the tutorial section of the game(Great Plateau) with help with an old man(King of Hyrule). Once done you head to Impa and she tells you what happened in the past and what the objects are. Those objectives are to regain memories and defeat four divine beasts, then kill Ganon. That may seem like a lot but really isn't people, especially for a Zelda game. Take twilight princess for example, it has loads of story. Botw on the other hand, its story is just bare and boring.

- Divine beasts/Shrines/Ganon -
Divine beasts and shrines are WAY to easy. give us some challenge. although the first time you do a divine beast did have a bit of difficulty but then that is it, because after that you get really OP really fast. Shrines aren't even a puzzle, they are ""just do this and win"". Ganon was really cool, super easy fight by super cool. Ganon to me was more for coolness points than difficulty.

- Difficulty -
kinda hard in the beginning depending on which way you want to go, then you get super OP and is really easy. not much to say

- Weather -
Rain and Thunderstorms are crap and stupid, blood moons are cool though.

- Side Quests -
side quests are okay don't really care about and they don't serve much a purpose, they don't take anything away to the experience which is good.

- random cons -
MASTER SWORD IS OPTIONAL!! REALLY, that is an absurd move for Nintendo. Repeat The Master Sword is an option, you don't need to get it. Wow.

- Overall amounts of fun -
so much fun with the game, don't know how many hour I've played but i'll tell you this, it is a lot. super sup getting collectibles and Armor to upgrade.

- loot and items -
amazing job on this department, with countless amount of armor, weapons, shields, food, and more.
although the durability of weapons is way to low. weapons break way to easily. other than that its great, durability needs fixing.

- DLC pack 1 -
master trials are awesome, items are cool, but are pretty useless

-overall-

Music= 3/10
Story= 3/10
Divine Beasts = 3/10
Shrines = 4/10
Ganon= 8/10
Difficulty= 4.5/10
Weather= 2/10 too much water
side quests= 6/10

Total 7/10

Don't see how people give this 10/10 with all of its flaws, people who give this game 0/10 just want to cause trouble, I like to see people who rate this game with thought in mind.

rachillustrate,09-07-2018,"Breath of the Wild not only feels vast in the scale of its map, but also in adventure and discovery, having new exciting things to find at every turn. The world is immersive and provides so much to explore. One of the strongest elements in the game are the “memories” you find throughout your journey. These provide back-story, context, character development, and an overall stronger connection to the world. Breath of the Wild also showcases Zelda in her strongest form, being a far more developed character than ever before in the series. I felt strongly connected to her and her struggle, which provided a more satisfying end-game. Furthermore, the world is absolutely breathtaking, and the character designs are beautiful and bold.

One mistake I think the game makes is the implementation of breakable weapons. This added unnecessary anxiety as I began avoiding enemies to avoid wasting my best weapons. In such an exploration-driven world, it’s a shame to feel restricted only because of your equipment's mortality. The master sword eases this pain slightly, however, I still completed the game with an entire arsenal of weapons I was too afraid to waste.

In the end, Breath of the Wild revolutionizes its franchise with THE best Legend of Zelda game to date.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

LumberSlicc,23-05-2018,"I have never beat a Zelda game, ever. I have been playing Video Games since I was 7 with the original Playstation. Since then I have been to the Playstation 2, Xbox 360, Playstation 3, then to the PC and PS4. I have never touched a Nintendo console unless I was at a friend's house. Come December of 2017, and everyone is talking about the Nintendo Switch. So I pick one up, got Breath of the Wild, and was blown away.

Pros:
-Big open world that feels hand crafted and polished beyond many games coming out in 2017
-Beautiful cel shading aesthetic that feels right at home for the Switch
-A massive amount of things to do/content that it doesn't feel like filler
-Combat and progression fit so perfectly together to make you feel stronger while looking stronger
- THE PARAGLIDER!!!!! (also shieldsurfing is neat)

Cons:
-The bosses (non overworld) don't stand out much from the rest
-Some places have frame drops (after updates they are less, but still prominent in one particular area)
-I have been told that all the Zelda games have amazing story, and I feel like the main story doesn't fulfill that void. BUT I will say that the story the world itself tells from the minute to minute gameplay beyond satisfied that issue, just something to address.

After 115 hours playing on the couch, toilet, work, driving, flying, wherever and whenever, I will always have a love for this game. I now own my own Nintendo console and I have never been happier with a game I haven't had this much fun with since Skyrim.

In short, play this game please. I am in my second playthrough and I am in love all over again.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

- + combat system is your basic swords and shields but only here they break every 10 seconds the bow is saving it from being bad imo
- Story is laughable.
- barely any Voice acting.
- outdated graphics.
- same enemies.
+ it has good variety of armors etc.
+ the glide and climbing mechanic is fun.
+ pretty good interaction with the world",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Loo_oo,04-07-2018,"9 car ce jeu n'est pas parfait ! L'open world est tout juste magnifique mais pour moi il manque 2 points importants qui ont fait le succès de la série :
- les dongeons, qui constituent la mythologie d'Hyrule !
- les thèmes musicaux trop minimalistes (qui se souvient d'une musique de cet opus ? par contre, tout le monde se souvient de la musique de A Link To the Past sur Super NES...)

Ce que j'ai aimé (+) :
- L'Open World (immense, varié, magique)
- Les cheveaux
- La physique exceptionnelle qui devient une référence dans l'industrie vidéoludique
- La variété des tenues & armes.
- Le système de crafting

Ce que je n'ai pas aimé (-) :
- Où sont les donjons ? Les temples (trop nombreux à mon goût) n'apportent rien à l'aventure.
- Les armes qui se cassent trop souvent. Du moins, je pense qu'à partir d'un certain niveau d'arme celles-ci devraient être incassables
- Les musiques ""sans saveur""... c'est plutôt fade, vous ne la chantonnerez pas !",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
itshapiro,07-05-2018,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is overall a really great game. Most of it is awesome, if not perfect.

The game starts you off in this dark room where a voice is guiding you. She tells you to go pick up this item, and you proceed to the next room which is similar. Then, a tunnel opens and you run outside. The cutscene that follows this is probably the most beautiful version of the game. It gives you a huge pan of the world of Hyrule.

Now, you are free to explore. That’s one of the best parts about this game. Your just dropped into it, to do whatever you want. This is the games strongest point-it’s exploration. The world is jam packed with things like Korok seeds, and shrines which I will get to later on.

Though you may not notice it at first, once you talk to an old man, you will realize that you are actually confined. Though, the game does this in a very good way.

In order to learn the basics, you pretty much do a miniature version of the full game. You are in a fairly large starting area, which fits the theme of exploration. You are tasked by this old man, to go to this think called a shrine. There are many of these throughout the game. Though I do think that these could have been better, they are still good.

You will end of doing four of these shrines, and then the old man will give you the paraglider, which you can use to jump off of the Great Plateu.

Now, you’re free. You can do anything you want. Heck, you can even go to the final boss now. But I wouldn’t. Trust me, you’re missing out.

The old man tells you to head to Kakariko village, to meet someone named Impa. Impa, tells you about the Divine Beasts. Four giant mechanical animals, each in different corners of the map. You are tasked to travel to each of them, Divine Beast Vah Ruta, of the Zora, Divine Beast Vah Naboris of the Gerudo, Divine Beast Vah Medoh of the Rito, and Divine Beast Vah Rudania, of the Goron. Impa tells you that you can learn more from each of the races at each Divine Beast.

Now, the best parts of the game are definitely Vah Ruta and Vah Naboris. But the main reason that this review is a 9 is because of the Vah Medoh portion of the game.

Even if Vah Medoh is the first Beast you take down, it is still way to easy, and I feel like this whole part of the game was rushed.

Also, the Calamity Gabon fight could have been way better, and the Dark Beast Ganon fight was very underwhelming.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
adrewtoremember,09-05-2018,"The weapon durability system is incredibly annoying, and the world, while vast and detailed, lacks life and feels empty at times.

Rayvn,12-06-2018,"Should be called ""Zelda: Hunt of the Shrines and Koroks."" I will start by saying I have been a long term Zelda fan since ""Link's Awakening"" and ""A Link to the Past"" and I felt that this game was heading in the right direction but somewhere along the lines they lost track. Also, I have been avoiding all spoilers, gameplays, movies, music, or reviews of this game at all costs so I can go into it with a fresh perspective with zero expectations for a brand new fresh unbiased experience.

This will not be a full fledged review because it'll be too long. I'll keep it short with bullet points. Let's start with the pros.

PROS:
- Great design and art style. I'm not a big fan of the chosen art style personally, but I can still appreciate and accept it for being good, even if it's not my style. I give it points here instead of docking it. Credit where credit is due.
- Great sound and music. I love the sound of link running around, the clashing of weapons and items, the ambient and environmental sounds. They all are very soothing and fun to listen to.
- Big and diverse open world. Whether you like the cold or want to be sweating next to a volcano this game has got you covered.
- Being able to climb can be fun at times.
- The divine beasts were pretty cool but were a bit weak.

CONS:
- Horrible and annoying weapon system. Everything breaking every few hits and always worrying about dropping weapons to pick up new ones is a chore, not something fun to do.
- Climbing is kind of... annoying and indecisive. You seemingly can climb everything, literally. Even most flat 90 degree surfaces or even surfaces that slope outwards where realistically a seasoned climber would even fail to do. All this and in some places your climbing ability is randomly disabled entirely just for the sake of the level not being too easy. Very convenient.
- Cooking food and elixirs is annoying not really necessary. I used less then five elixirs all game (most were given to me by NPC), most of the food I just cook an apple with something hearty and that's all I need to get a full recovery plus a few hearts. I didn't bother with all the other ingredients, combinations, or recipes at all. It's just another component that acts mainly as noise instead of something I'd love to do and look forward to do in a Zelda game.
- The world is boring. Yes, it's beautiful and vast, but that's about it, literally. Here, I'll describe 95% of the whole world of this game: take a snapshot of the entire map, randomly distribute goblin camps around, some animals here and there, and a bunch of shrines and koroks hidden around. That's pretty much it. I was excited to explore the world at first but I quickly found that no matter where I go, it's just a bunch of goblins, repetitive puzzles from koroks, and repetitive shrines. What's over here? a korok. Let's climb that mountain! A shrine. Let's glide down to this forest and see what's here! Another korok puzzle... go around the corner, another shrine! Also goblins. Rinse. Repeat.
- Shrines were very annoying. I felt like they REALLY want to promote you hunting shrines as the main goal of the game. 95% of the shrines were literally kill one machine, or use one of your skills once to solve this easy puzzle. Then you get a weak breakable weapon and an orb. It doesn't feel rewarding and feels like a cheap cop-out to make the game seem longer than it really is. Once in a while there's a decent shrine and a better item, but that's like one our of ten or fifteen shrines. Average of 10mins per shrine, 120+ shrines, that's at LEAST 20 hours gameplay they pushed into these shrines... the Koroks are even worse.
- No sense of adventure or curiosity to explore because every time I do, it's the same shrine, the same goblins, the same korok, etc. I quickly rushed through the story after running to uncover the maps by finding all the towers.

Overall I expected to put in over 100 hours because I'm the type of person to want to get everything, unlock everything, find everything, and become as strong as I can be. Started the game and started running around exploring. Didn't find much so I went on with the story, unlocked the divine beasts, then found all the towers to unlock the map, then rushed on to beat Ganon. I had 13 hearts total and the ancient armor. Gave up on exploring because I already know what I would find. Overall I think I put in 40 hours? and maybe half is running around, shrines, and koroks. Older games favor backtracking as you gain more abilities. This game you get ALL of your abilities from the start so you lose the sense of progression as well. Overall a good game, not great game. Worth trying at least once.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BOTW,12-06-2018,"As a casual gamer type of person, I really enjoyed BOTW

A great feature that I personally enjoy is that you are able to physically feel vibrations through the Switch when you are fighting monsters or carrying certain objects. This is true for other consoles as well, but because I am not much of a gamer, and this is a game that has piqued my interest, this tiny feature makes all the difference. It immerses you in the game by making it feel like you are the actual character inside of this game, feeling the blows of the monsters or experiencing the weight of a chest that you are holding. Sound effects really add to the aesthetic of the game as well. Such as when Link is walking through the grass, you hear the swishing of the blades, but when he walks across boulders or cement, you hear his actual footsteps. Also, when Link goes swimming, you can hear the splashing of the water as you guide him to the other side of the pond. You also hear the light swooshing of the wind as you walk and run around through Hyrule. The attention to detail of this game is astounding! A unique feature that sets this game apart from others is that the main protagonist, Link, does not speak, but rather, you hear the sound of his breath as it speeds up when you are climbing a wall or his grunts when he fights monsters. The reason behind this is later on revealed near the end of the game. Music also plays a big role in this game. While you are completing certain tasks/missions or just exploring the area, you can hear faint music in the background. The music is most apparent when there are cut-scenes and when you encounter certain individuals/monsters. The score is beautiful in my opinion and I am actually writing this review while listening to the music!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Dedus,11-05-2019,"If you like the standard open world formula of linear (ish) 40+ hr campaign, cities/villages with tons of (in my opinion often pointless) side content, and (generally empty) wilderness whose main purpose is to create distance between content, then this game is most likely not for you. If you think The Witcher 3 is a flawless masterpiece (I'm happy for you in such case), then there is a great chance you will not enjoy this game.

However, if you left that game with an empty stomach however, maybe it was the dragging story, the repetitiveness of the side quests or the unfulfilling exploration, then you probably will love this game to death. No more dragging campaigns- the main story is completely optional and you can go beat the final boss whenever you feel ready. No more copy + paste open world - the entirety of the gigantic 72 km^2 map is handcrafted and breathtakingly full of both beauty and discoveries to make. No more static nature - grass can be cut, trees can be felled and mindboggingly realistic wildlife can be observed or hunted for food.

IchigoTargaryen,28-09-2018,"This entry is a worthwhile successor to the storied franchise that fans have enjoyed for three decades. It's take on open world is quite unique as you can basically go fight the final boss whenever you feel like it, but you'll probably be under prepared and will miss out on one of Link's best stories to date. The graphics look incredible even when your playing on the go and everything runs pretty smoothly. The combat is good but is plagued by a terrible weapon durability system that sees everything break relatively quickly to make you more likely to try new weapons but for me was just more of a hindrance than any thing else. The game features a bunch of side quests but most of them are simple and not well written. The fast travel system is enjoyable as you have to unlock them and the dungeons were well done. All in all I'd say Breath of the Wild is a tremendous game that's easily the third best game of the franchise, it has it's problems but nothing is perfect and it proved that Link and Zelda still have a bright future in gaming even after so many years.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Because of the fluid movements and gameplay, as soon as you get used to the mechanics in this Zelda game – the other action RPG games will not be the same. You'll will try to climb things in other games, you will try to glide to get somewhere faster and you'll remind that the industry didn't get there yet.

The electricity element in this game, fascinates me. It's incredible to combine water, metal and electricity as a weapon against enemies.

The sheer amount of interactions between items, abilities, and everything else in the world is incredible. You could play this game for months without discovering everything you can do/see.

In terms of the story, I was especially glad to see Zelda have a more impactful role rather than just being the same old damsel in distress.

Cocinar, mejorar la ropa, cambiarla de color, coleccionar armas, hacer fotos, resolver las capillas... todo es un gran viaje y una gran experiencia.
Tras jugar una partida juegas una segunda con la experiencia personal afianzada, y en esta ya te lanzas a por el 100% del juego disfrutándolo de otra manera.

Batesiebum,15-01-2019,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild is amazing. The world is almost perfect with one of the most ingenious tutorial locations I have ever seen. The world is crafted in such a way that exploration is mandatory, many mountains and trees will block your view which forces the player to seek out natural vantage points such as mountains or towers to map out and find points of interest or paths. Surprisingly, this does not make the player stray too far from the path because objective markers show where the objective is on the map, but not how to get there (only for main quest). This further emphasises exploration since it makes the player form their own routes to objectives instead of following a pre-determined path allowing them to make their own adventures and get caught up in various discoveries along the way. Along your travels you can discover any or all of the 120 shrines that contain puzzles to be completed in return for spirit orbs that can be exchanged for your choice of heart containers or stamina vessels, any or all of the 900 environmental discovery/experimentation korok seeds that can be exchanged for inventory space, 76 side quests that can be of collection, extermination, or recovery types that have varying rewards, 42 shrine quests that usually require the player to solve riddles or use small amounts of dialogue to discover shrines (these are included in the 120 spoken of previously), 12 memories that provide more depth to the story and are found in locations around the map, and some other random things . Of course none of this is required, if the player chooses to go straight to the final boss without doing any of this they can though they will likely one hit killed. Combat is also great, the game does not use perks instead it requires the player to learn their enemies attacks and read when you dodge and attack appropriately. Weapons do have attack power attached to them but the fact that your weapons eventually break from use it causes you to experiment with other weapons but also approach each encounter with a plan of attack. There are four dungeons in this Zelda game, but they are not as diverse or complex as previous games. The build up to each one is exciting and really keeps your attention but once inside they all emit the same aesthetic, although the interactive dungeon map is an interesting aspect that could really be a welcome addition to the series the dungeons over all are good but not great,but in no way truly subtract or take away from the overall game.

I think the idea is that the main story is there to guide the user into exploring this vast world but I prefer a more classic JRPG style which focus more on a good main story.

MATHEFREECK,02-06-2019,"First, I think this game is great, but when I see other Zelda games, I have to say: they are much better than this one.
Everything was personal to me Zelda has always been missing in this game simply.
I loved to play through the big dungeons in the predecessors. The shrines rarely have variety are far too short, and offer no real value.
The map is big, but not well filled. The only thing you can find are ""Krogs"" ... Nothing else.
The story is good but far too short.
Weapons break down too fast.
Nice that Nintendo has tried something new, it's also a fantastic game, but then I say: Please next time more in the direction of a classic Zelda.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

yeeetboi,18-11-2019,"Pretty fun once you get into it, but honestly there isn't much to love about this game. Weapons break very easily which is annoying. Combat is fun, but there isn't enough creatures to fight in my opinion. And don't get me started on guardians. They are awful. They're incredibly hard to kill, and incredibly hard not to die in the process. They target you and are very hard to get off. They kill you instantly unless you have gained many hearts. Getting places for quests is hard and just annoying. There are many things while exploring that annoyingly kill you. Lightning, random stupid overpowered enemies, and being in the cold. And the rain. The rain is incredibly annoying. Technically you can climb while it's raining, but it makes you fall back every few seconds. So you have to wait if you want to climb normally. This is only some of the things that annoy me about this game. I do NOT recommend this game for the price.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Su banda sonora es bastante pobre (casi inexistente), la historia brilla por su ausencia, las mazmorras clásicas se han perdido, Los santuarios de este juego dan bastante pena y son bien fáciles, hay poca variedad de enemigos, las misiones secundarias, son la mayoría de recadero, y aun así, te dan recompesas bastante malas.

Kanto255,14-11-2019,"This game without a doubt is a fresh breath of air with its open world, exploration and combat, and in the first hours the game is exhilarating to play with all the different possibilities. However, once you have sunk some time into it, the game doesn't offer much depth, with the 120 shrines scattered around being fun to find, but extremely repetitive in aesthetic and gameplay. There are only 4 dungeons akin to what we are used to from the series, and they all look the same and are short and simplistic, feeling like small sidequests. The story is a bland amnesia plot and very much copies the formula we have always seen (which isn't a bad thing itself but they seemed to care about expanding the story this time around with having voice actors and a better developed world). My biggest complaint might sound petty, but the visual grey ""filter"" really hurts the aesthetic experience for me, and I wish they could have stuck with the colours of the E3 reveal trailer. With that said, the world itself is surprisingly well-designed, with the shrines always making you scout and wonder how to progress. I would recommend borrowing it, but keep your money for BotW 2. I trust that Nintendo will listen to feedback and improve on the numerous faults of this title.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

PastelGoldBabe,22-12-2019,"I am not a big fan of long games or of fighting or of bosses or what most of most video games are like. Although that’s what this game has, I am very content with doing side quests, walking around looking for food, cooking said food, riding my horse, buying and selling things. Doing that is very relaxing and fun. Traveling from town to town whether it’s by food, horse or by beaming there is a lot of fun. I never fought a boss and usually run pass any enemies who will eventually stop chasing you. I only fight easy enemies if they have stuff I want. So if you’re not into fighting (which this game has a lot of) you can still get away with doing very little fighting. There are a lot of other things besides fighting that you can do at a relaxing pace. This game is super long, lots of land to cover, lots of temples/puzzles to solve but definitely worth the price.

I was hoping the expansion would extend this inventory but unfortunately not. I feel the game is just difficult enough. What I would change is the durability of just about everything, but more importantly the weapons. Numerous times I've used multiple weapons to get a weapon out of a chest or off an enemy and no matter what it wasn't worth it because the weapon breaks on one silver/gold enemy.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Crevvy,29-12-2019,"I loved most of this game, it is one of my favorites of all time, the gameplay is incredible, the world is one of the, if not the best worlds in gaming history, it really was worth the 6 year wait, but, there is a few cons I have to point out, I will also make a list of pros.

Pros: Amazing gameplay, amazing world, great combat, fun to mess around in, cool physics engine, and a surprisingly interactive world.

Cons: There is few cons I can say about this game, some of them are pretty major though. 1: The dungeons/divine beasts: These are terrible puzzle areas when it comes to this franchise, but I do get their main goal was making the world as interactive as possible, this also includes the bosses, they are way too easy and are a copy and paste with very minor changes. Flaw number 2: you can't change the controls: this flaw is pretty minor as the controls the game has are pretty good, but there is some changes I would do to the controls, nowadays, most single-player and multiplayer games have this feature, so it's disappointing this game didn't include it. Flaw number 3: the enemy variety: Don't get me wrong, I love this games combat, but the thing is it didn't vary much because of the lackluster enemy variety, this is also an issue as many of the enemies are a total pushover, such as ChuChus, keese, and the little stone guys (not talus, those are fun to fight). I do love fighting lynels, but it gets repetitive after a while.

Overall, and conclusion:

This game is one of the best games nintendo has published, and that's quite a surprise as they've published many hits. It deserved game of the year in 2017, and is a must buy if you have a switch.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Where Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess (my previous 2 favorite Zeldas) the dungeons felt like main attractions and the overworld an afterthought, in BotW it is the reverse. And the microdungeons aren't so bad. Some of them are pretty forgettable, some of them are pretty great, and others are minibosses that serve to test skills you'll need to hone. Not since the Witcher 3 have I felt this much wonder from just walking place to place, observing the spectacular scenery and finding new optional sidequests and secret items. And traversing and interacting with the environment are way more fun in BotW than any game before it.

RZaga,28-01-2020,"One of the most engaging games I've played. I always find myself spending hours on the game at a time thanks to the massive amount of stuff to do.

Graphics and world design are spectacular. The open-world gameplay allows players to go off and see all the things that catches their eyes without dire consequences. The music felt ambient and calm which really fit in with the mood of the game.

The longer you play the more apparent the flaws of the game start to appear, such as the repetitiveness in looking for shrines and korok seeds, the tediousness and low rewards of some side quests, and the lack of depth in storytelling. But these only become apparent after the main story, which takes about 50 hours to complete. Those 50 hours of fun and engaging play are more than enough to make up for the game's minor downsides.

The world is beautiful (if a little barren in some spots -- perhaps intentionally so), and exploring it feels great. As many have said it sets a new bar for open world titles, and the shoes will be harder to fill after Breath of the Wild. My only gripe is that there are no dungeons, and very few items to unlock that affect the game in any meaningful way. Side quests are usually a bit dull (at this point I feel like a lot of games just tack them on because they think they have to) but some of them are pretty good. It's hit or miss with them.

I enjoyed most of the puzzles but couldn’t quite understand most parts of the story, I have seen other players get emotional over this beloved nostalgic series unfortunately I didn’t get swept up by it. After finishing the game I found it to have a lacklustre ending and couldn’t find anything else to keep myself really enveloped In its large open world, I found myself returning the game to the store in exchange for a different switch game.

Distinctly average. Lacks any kind of strong plot, characters have little to no development, and therefor no reason to care about them.

Non of the extra grind for heart containers, weapons, shields etc feels compulsively like a must do! Having heard so much good about it, I’m struggling to find what game people were playing.

The enormous amount of shrines dotted around the map are great places to test said gameplay mechanics as well as your puzzle solving skills, as you will need to use different mechanics you have learned throughout the game to solve a puzzle or pass a challenge.

The game also has a somewhat simple but great and impactful narrative that I will not go to into detail of in case of spoilers.

Overall, this is one of the best The Legend Of Zelda game ever released and one of my personal favourite games currently on the Nintendo Switch. The only reason it is not a 10 for me is because many times I have felt that weapons go through their durability far too fast, and the game does not reach a certain threshold of enjoyment for me to give it a 10. However, I still regard this game as a masterpiece and would recommend this game to anyone with a Nintendo Switch.

Sensou,31-05-2022,"Bought my Switch this year and decide to start my journey with Zelda.

Well, it's a very great game to begin with. Kind of slow at start because the game set you free from the beginning which you need to learn some of the mechanics by yourself and how things work as well as variation with the combat strategy and how you can utilize your abilities. But, it's the charm of the game and its amazing experience.

Hyrule is big and I cannot say its filled with a lot of monster or collectibles but at the same time its not an empty open world, so it's still a pleasing experience to explore the world. Speaking of exploration, all features that necessary for exploring is absolutely well design. Paraglider, climbing mechanic, wind mechanic, mount horse or other animals in the world, etc is just feels right and great.

Texture of the game kind of low but overall graphics still great, probably its due to the FPS concern as I've rarely experience frame rate drop but there's a consistent FPS drop on Korok Forest, don't know why (too many trees?)

SInce its my first Zelda game I should say the story is good, linear and quite simple to understand the whole point of the game. Hope they can shake things up with the narrative on the upcoming Zelda BOTW.

Here comes the point where I just can't stand these issue which I cannot rate this game 10/10. The first 1 point deduction is because:
- Weapon Durability = Perfectly Great Feature but wish they add feature to fix the weapon or add smithing feature for us to enhance its durability. Going into Shrine ""Test of Strength"" is the best example how this feature ruins the experience. You are winning but your weapon cannot keep up with it so you end up losing because you broke all your weapon before defeating the guardian.

- Rain = Understandable for weather features but somehow rain has become an obstacle or disaster in Hyrule. How come it got rain everyday? Luckily there's no rain in Goron

- Healing = Can you add just one UI to accommodate a fast healing process? I don't mean it need to be a primary feature but just add it as an option because I do understand the advantage of pausing the game and heal yourself but at the same time I think its better to keep the flow of the combat keep flowing without any interruption from the healing process.

The other 2 POINTS DEDUCTION is because the COMBAT MECHANICS!!
- Lock-on Design = Nintendo, please fire whoever come up with this Lock-on Design. I know you don't want to ruin your fragile analog but what the hell you use ""ZL"" for lock on. And to complement that, the range to lock-on your enemy is way too short. Whenever I press ""ZL"" it keeps resetting my camera instead of locking on enemy. The fight with Naboris become a nightmare because of this.

- Weapons Swap = The animation to swap your weapon is too long, I keep dying to Naboris because my weapons are broken and it takes way too much time to swap or take another weapon (not to mention if you use a heavy weapon, disaster). To fix this you can run towards the enemy and press the attack button to unsheathe your weapon right away without waiting for the animation.

Well believe me, there's way too many features and things to talk about Zelda BOTW and overall its just a magnificent and amazing game. They just need to make the combat more fluid and fix that lock-on feature, please.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

TOMARKTUS,14-09-2022,"As a casual gamer (5-8 hours/week), BotW was a game experience with one of the worst expectations-to-actual-experience ratio I have ever endured. I won't go into all that's already been said about the breathtaking natural æsthetics or the absolutely annoying weapon breakage system.

To me the main argument against this game is its inflection of the licence. Zelda games were always a tale-like experience. With fairies, monsters, narratives, æsthetics. BotW isn't a tale. It has tales in it, but it is meant as a far too serious and realistic game, with its hazardous open-world, motorbike, Seikah slate (= smartphone, even taking pictures), etc.

The irruption of technology and too realistic problematics makes it swing into something totally different.

When playing, I don't wanna spend hours walking in a vast empty world looking for wood, food & goods that ultimately break, etc.

I also don't need hyper-casual instant fun. I love long stories. But somehow BotW is absolutely not rewarding under several tens of hours; which means weeks and weeks to me.

tdub154420,29-03-2017,"Gameplay hours does not equal a good game. Neither does freedom or a good physics engine. These are novelties, or components, of what can make a good game. But you take these things away from BOTW and there's not as much there as other Zelda games. I'll admit, I'm in the minority, but I personally don't care much for open world games, and I don't like RPG's. I do love Zelda though. Ocarina of Time is the best game of all time, and Link's last outing in a Link Between Worlds was nothing short of pure genius. I even liked Skyward Sword a lot. But those games were about varied gameplay and puzzle solving. In prior Zelda's there were constantly new items and abilities that would change the gameplay. Getting the hookshot didn't just change where you could go but it changed how you could solve puzzles, how you could travel, and how you could fight in a way that made the game feel slightly different once you got the hookshot. There isn't that varied gameplay in this entry. There's something to be said for having all your abilities available so soon in the game and being able to travel wherever you want immediately, but they did sacrifice gameplay variation for this. From start to finish the gameplay never really changes or is varied much, and that is very different from any other Zelda. I did mention earlier that I like puzzle solving elements of Zelda games, and that is what is very good about this game. Previous Zelda's often only had one way to solve a puzzle, this games unique physics engine has made it so you can solve a puzzle in a variety of ways. That is very cool. But it takes 35 minutes to traverse to the puzzle because along the way you break 1 shield and 3 swords, have to cook 3 meals and die Dark Souls style 4 times from random enemy camps. This thing is a time pit, and not in a way that I like. Skyward Sword had varying temples and lands that were very artistically inspired. Breath of the Wild is inspired not by art, but by nature. And I can understand that appeal, but the flashy, highly stylized and varying elements of Skyward Sword appealed to me a lot more. I wanted to like this game, but I'm nearing the end I just haven't found it as enjoyable as any Zelda I've played before it. A miss from Nintendo in my book.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

geodeath,09-03-2017,"Blows my mind, how many people give this a 10/10. It has serious flaws. I never read reviews or watch trailers because i prefer to play a game myself but in this case, if i knew what it is about, i would never have bought a switch and zelda on day 1, but would rather wait for mario first.

First of all, the game has a few serious flaws:

1. ALL EQUIPMENT BREAKS. Yes, you heard that right. EVERY SINGLE thing you will ever equip, weapon, shield or arrow WILL BREAK REALLY REALLY quickly. To give you a quick example a NEW just picked up weapon of any kind, let's say a sword (metal), WILL BREAK and will be discarded and not able to be repaired at most after killing 2 enemies. Read that again: to beat a mob of let's say 5-6 enemies (and it is quite common for them to mob like that, usually 3-6) you WILL HAVE to equip 2-3 weapons. You think i am crazy? Try to find youtube videos about it. BEFORE YOU BUY IT.

This issue alone is so infuriating that makes me want to sell my copy and not play it altogether until they fix it with a patch. I understand the idea here is to introduce weapon degradation but you cannot repair anything and the degradation happens IMMEDIATELY. I like the degradation as it happens e.g. on Dying Light! Here it is a real nightmare and makes the game a hoarding exercise.

2. Believe it or not, if you want to restore energy (your heart meter) you have to COOK. You have to actually remember recipes and find pots scattered around the open world to cook elixirs and foods to carry around. If you simply eat the raw materials you only get half a heart to a heart. They turned an adventure game into a SURVIVALIST game. Dear lord!!

3. They really wanted to one-up the open world games by showing they can do it. The bad thing is they WAY overdid it. The world is exceptionally large, to the point where it is uselessly so. I can easily run for 5-10 minutes without encountering a SINGLE THING AT ALL. Yes, the environment is nice and all, but it is also repetitive. At the end of the day, is the size that matters or if the locations stuck to your mind because they were important and nice? They just wanted to boast about the size of the world. Good Nintendo, good. We knew you can make the world large. Now, make it interesting please?

4. All of the classic Zelda stuff are missing: hookshot, boomerang, etc etc etc. Somehow, all weapons are not breakable really easily, arrows run out like farts, yet bombs are not a rune, so infinite? lol

5. NO DUNGEONS! The one thing this series was known for, the clever dungeons, some of which were real mind crackers to solve, are not there anymore. In their place, are **** 2 minute ""shrines"" that give you some orbs that you can exchange for heart containers or stamina boosters. NO DUNGEONS!!!!!!

By all means, this is not a bad game at all. It is just an OK game. If you have a WiiU, get it. If you have to buy a switch to play this DO NOT DO IT unless you read all the non 10/10 opinions here and check videos and the faqs. I did the same and am supremely disappointed by this.

This is not Nintendo. This is not Zelda at all. It feels like a mix of Far cry/Witcher/Dying Light that tries to do everything but fails to do well in all aspects. Nintendo simply over-reached and did not manage to get to the level of quality we expected.

Now, for the good parts:

1. It is nice that the environment plays a big role. For example, when it is raining, you cannot climb some walls or you can be struck by lightning. The environment is very nicely thought out.

2. Although the graphics are nowhere near other current gen titles, you cannot blame how good they are for the hardware they run on. The world is beautiful and vast, if bland.

3. You get a nice sense of being out, it is quite beautiful in that way if you like exploration.

4. You can play this on the go!

Please, take this review seriously. This is coming from a 35 year old gamer, having played all consoles and games from the Atari 2600 to the Switch & Ps4 Pro. I have no bias towards Nintendo, actually it is my favourite company, but they do seem to tend to get all the wrong decisions lately.

I am afraid to say that i am much more inspired by Horizon than Zelda and it is a crying shame. If only they took care to address the few things i am mentioning (or even provide them as options!) then we would be talking about GOTY. In it's current state, GOTY will only be because of bias or because Nintendo needs a kick and everybody is hyped.

reconscout,09-03-2017,"You can swim up waterfalls. You can climb almost every wall. Seriously, I'm a bit disappointed with the graphics but the gameplay is extremely fun. You can't say that about a lot of games. I've literally spent hours in the opening area, taking on Bokoblin camps and exploring the shrines. I love the combat variety. Bomb, Ice, Fire arrows. Thunder swords/spears. Remote Bombs. The combat is so much more in depth compared to past Zelda titles. Definitely one of the greatest games I've ever played.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
PokeLink64,12-03-2017,"First off, this is NOT BIAS. It's not my fault that most Zelda games are amazing. Besides, Breath of the Wild is a very different Zelda game.
AND I HAVE PLAYED THE FRICKING GAME
If you are gonna write a review for a video game, fricking play it first. And play it until you beat it. Unless it's a very long game like this one, then you should at least beat all the main dungeons, go to all the towers, play for over 50 hours or something like that. Who knows, the game could get better.
And I don't care if you're defending a game I love without playing it or not, JUST PLAY THE GAME FIRST, PLEASE
Okay, here we go.

Graphics: ""Oh my, it's not 4K. Oh my gosh, the textures are so flat. Zelda's a*s isn't that great.""
No. The game looks beautiful. Why? BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FRICKING LOOK LIKE THE GOD DA*N REAL WORLD!
If you WANT great graphics, watch a fricking movie, look at some pictures, GO FOR A WALK.
Breath of the Wild's art style is amazing. DO YOU SEE THAT GRASS? AND THE SUN ON THE GRASS AND THE WATER AT SOME TIMES CAN BE SO FRICKING BEAUTIFUL OH MY GOD
But yeah, some textures are flat, BUT YOU ONLY NOTICE THEM IF YOU TRY TO NOTICE THEM
9.7 out of 10 for graphics.

Music: Uh... Yeah, there isn't much. But it fits the game so well. And you could always play your own music with your phone or something.
Most ""songs"" can be forgetable, but some are pretty great. Like the overworld boss themes.
And the two trailer themes are FRICKING BEAUTIFUL
8.4 out of 10 for music, because not much music fits the game pretty well.

Story: Don't ask me lol
I can never seem to concentrate on stories. When I was four to fourteen I always skipped the diaglog in all games lol.
I tried to read the story in this game, and it's awesome.
7.6 out of 10, because non-Zelda fans might not think it's that great. But what do I know about story?

UI: 10/10. There's basically NO handholding. NONE. People who say there is are so dumb and are making up stuff just to give this game a bad review. Yeah, the game tells you some controls, BUT ONLY FOR A FEW SECONDS. AND AFTER AROUND AN HOUR IT'S DONE GIVING YOU TIPS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

Sounds: 10/10. The birds, water, Rupees and stuff all sound great. (At least on the Switch.)

English Voice Acting: 9/10. I don't know much about voice acting, or talking lol, but most of it sounded great to me.

Frame Rate: 5/10. It runs well. There are some dips with a lot of beautiful grass. But it doesn't bother me that much, becase it only happens to me once every hour or so. And it's such a great game that I can just ignore it. (But it's still a bad thing, though,)

And Gameplay (THE MOST IMPORTANT THING) : Amazing. Exploring Hyrule, finding Shrines, fighting monsters, doing side quests, cooking, and gathering stuff are all great.

You could easily spend over 100 hours exploring. Okay, maybe some people would get bored of that, but there's still quite a bit of awesome distracting stuff that you can't miss.

Shrines can be very short, and some can be pretty easy. There's over 100 of these, so there's definitely some that will have a very smart player stumped for a long time. You just gotta find them.

The weapon system is...good. Weapons breaking make it so if you find an ""OP"" item early, you won't be ""OP"" forever. ...But sometimes I feel like ""Should I drop this weapon and get this one, or not?"" And that's a bit annoying. Even though you can upgrade your inventory.

Side quests and Shrine quests can be VERY confusing. I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not when I spent a few minutes looking for where this ""cursed statue"" is. I still can't find the exact one lol

Cooking's cool, but I don't experament with it much. If you like to exparement with random stuff and see what you can come up with, then it'll be awesome for you.

Gathering materials, gear, Rupees, and weapons is really cool because it gives you more things to do and choices. You can go fight a boss right away if you wanna be quick or be ""cool"", or prepare by making some food that'll give you buffs, and putting on clothes that gives you buffs, and fight the boss with ease. Maybe. There's one boss that kicked my a*s a lot...

So, in conclusion, Breath of the Wild is a REALLY fun and addicting game, with great graphics, a pretty good story, and a good soundtrack that fits the game. Exploring the world is fun, and full of secrets and minigames just waiting to be found.
10 out of fricking 10. A master piece.
Definetly beter than Overrated of all Time.

tl;dr: PLAY THE GAME BEFORE YOU BUY IT, the only games with bad graphics are N64 games and pre-NES games (and some other games like the sims 1), REALLY fun for hours, and Ocarina of Time is good, not amazing.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MegaMagicMan,12-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild isn't just a normal game, the experience is one that you will never find anywhere else, this game is really big with so much to do, while the game is only 30 fps it fells like a 60 fps game despite a couple of frame rate drops that make it fell slightly worse which is almost minuscule amounts! Don't worry about the $20 DLC, as this game on it's own is already WAY MORE THAN A FULL GAME TRUST ME! I have done so much in this game I beat the story, and did over 40 shrines and supposedly my overall score on the map is only 20% There is so much more to do! This game is something else, and I recommend this game even if you aren't a Zelda fan, if you have a Wii U get the game on Wii U unless you have more reasons to get the Switch on day 1.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aurasphaerum,12-03-2017,"This game is simply amazing. Try it out, and you'll understand what I mean.
The world is HUGE. There is so much to discover. I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll stop here.

For those people complaining about graphics: I compared it to ""Horizon: Zero Dawn"" and I admit: Yes, BotW hasn't 4k or 451219 Fps, but because you see how much love Nintendo put into graphics you'll still love the look of Breath of the Wild.

The world is beautiful. The sounds and the calm music fit so very well...

Breaking weapons lead you to think carefully when to use your weapons. So I like the system. What I also like is that you can play the game without hurting any animal. (I haven't finished the game yet, so I'm not a 100% sure) I just ate plants and mushrooms so far. No problem.

Please give this game a chance. Because The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is...

Zeldafan999,12-03-2017,"One of the best games in the series since Ocarina of time. I have to say I knew that the game would be an open world, but I wasn't expecting to be more open than Skyrim. I had so many options to explore wherever I want and do the story way later. I could even go to the final boss almost right away if I wanted to, though I'll be obliterated the moment I face it. The durability for the weapons was a neat and fitting idea for Breath of the Wild, and while not necessary to pick em all up, it does help preparing you for future and/or unexpected fights, especially if your current one is close to breaking. One issue is mostly the inventory space for bows, melee weapons, and shields, and accessing them to equip them. However it's not enough to stop me from playing it the game.

The difficulty of the game is pretty much right. When coming across an enemy, you have to think strategically before facing them, since they can't be defeated the same way as the previous Zelda games, which is a pretty neat change. If you recklessly go into battle without preparing yourself, you will fall in battle in seconds. The bosses in the main dungeons are not very difficult, but I wouldn't say they were easy either.

The puzzles in the shrines are pretty rewarding, even the basic ones. You can also make a hard puzzle very simple when using motion controls. For example, I came across a maze that I had to solve. Instead of doing it the hard way, I just flipped it upside down and took the ball to the goal with little to no problems. Some of the shrines (mostly the tests of strength) have the same mechanics, but sometimes it's a good thing to not go through other types of puzzles when they get frustrating.

I love how the physics of the game follow the rules, and act naturally like in real life (deer eating grass, boulders being pushed and how Link experiences extreme temperatures). The good thing about the game is that I haven't encountered any bugs, minor or major, though sometimes, the game will temporarily freeze up for a second or two, but it's not a very big deal.

The Breath of the Wild deserves the Game of the Year, because it's the most enjoyable, breathtaking, and challenging game I have ever played in awhile.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Anyway this game does not deserve a 10. No game is perfect but this game in my opinion deserves a 9.-10 but not 10.
It's my favourite Zelda game beating Majora's mask and it's a epic open world game and that means it is amazing if it beats one of my all time Zelda games.

Bre59,17-03-2017,"I find it odd a game talks about good and evil of a hero. Fighting back an evil force of Ganon but the game breaking a very basic rule of the Commandments.

Compliants tended to be of spirits that haunt there homes who are of violent nature. Now these complainst came from non-believers, irreligious, Christian, and Buhddist/Hindu. I am worried because this game is so popular but most ppl do not know a spiritual history of the old testament talking directly against this pratice. Aka the KJV bible. I speak with voice of warning.

Caidryn,11-04-2018,"First, let me say, I have been a longtime Zelda fan. The first game was likely the second or third game I played in my life, and I have played and beaten all non-cooperative Zelda titles since. It is with a heavy heart that I now write this review, though I doubt anyone will see it. This is more for my own closure, I suppose.

I will very likely forever remember Breath of the Wild as the death of the series in my eyes. In their attempt to shake up and change where the series was headed they succeeded, without doubt. Yet, in doing so, they sacrificed so much of what it was. If this game had *not* been a Zelda game, I might have been able to forgive it so much more readily. But the fact that it is, and that it goes against just about every staple in the series, really makes me regret my purchase.

It removed dungeon items completely. It used to be that when you found a dungeon and went through it, there was an item inside. That item would usually completely reshape how you viewed the world around you. I often went back to places I'd been, filled with such a sense of satisfaction at all of the new things I could do. the new secrets I could find. Each heart piece, each tiny little side quest, permanently building forward to something more. There was a definitive sense of progression.

That progression was entirely missing from Breath of the Wild. The closest it got were outfits. Outfits with some single scenario benefit for specific situations. There were no heart pieces to be found. No items to be obtained. No world changing moments, no reason to scour the nooks and crannies and think creatively about the world around me. There were shrines, sure, and they were hidden, and they gave currency to be used on hearts or stamina. But it didn't feel the same, and really didn't even begin to have the same impact.

When silver enemies are out in the world, one hit takes something like 12 hearts in decent gear. If I have 13 hearts, or 20 hearts, it's really no different. Dead in two hits. As the world progresses with the number of orbs you have gained, it actually made me feel as though I was growing *weaker*, rather than stronger, as I went forward in the game.

The shrines themselves were little more than tiny setpieces. No cohesion to anything else, just self contained, bite sized tidbits masquerading as dungeons. This isn't what I play a Zelda for. If I want bite-sized experiences, there are games for that. TONS of games for that. Warioware exists. Hell, I personally loved the old mario party games (though emphasis on old). They were apt at providing small, varied, bite-sized chunks of gameplay. I went in knowing that, expecting that, bought them for that purpose, and enjoyed them quite well. But they aren't what I want in a Zelda.

The story and lore were next to non-present. My favorite of the series is Majora's Mask. The story was the drive to move forward. The moon was present, ever looming, the NPCs felt real, felt afraid, and it felt urgent that I save them. So much so that when I beat the game, I'd often redo all of the game's sidequests on the final run before beating the last boss, because I actively cared about the lives of the people in the game. When I left, I wanted all to be right and restored in their world.

But I found and felt none of that in Breath of the Wild. There was no imminent threat. Ganon was sealed indefinitely in his tower, the guardian beasts were safely sequestered, unable to do anything but cause mild annoyance. I never once felt a sense of urgency, which I accept was by design. But simply being intentional doesn't make it *good* or *right*. I never cared about the characters within it, and the game didn't seem to care much itself.

Memorable moments while playing the game were sparse and few as well. It's a side effect of making the game so sprawling. If a developer's attention is likened to water, it's the difference between a well and a puddle the size of a lake. Since they had to fill out everywhere, they couldn't give enough attention to anywhere in order to make it truly memorable or enjoyable. I think my most memorable moment personally was finding what I believe is the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time, and seeing it cut down at the middle and covered in literal feces. I bitterly remarked that it was apt for it to exist in such a way in this game, as it really feels like that was how they felt about the series at this point.

In the end, I could continue to gripe about how the weapons breaking constantly is awful design, control or fps issues, etc, that have been harped on a thousand thousand times, but it's simply not worth it.

If this game were not a Zelda, it might have scored more highly for me. Might have been a 7 or 7.5 out of 10. But I bought it and played it expecting a Zelda, and what I got was literally less than half of what I loved about the series.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Maikel_12,03-03-2017,"Darle 10 o 0 a este juego explica claramente ser fanboy o hater, estamos ante un ambicioso juego de nintendo con multitud de contenido, mazmorras bien elaboradas aunque bastante faciles, una historia que tristemente no fue lo que esperaba ya que termino siendo simplena, pero una jugabilidad genial, zelda breath of the wild no es una revolucion en la industria, puede que si en la saga, obviamente hace lo que muchos juegos hoy en dia hacen, copiar un poco de todo, los haters critican pero horizon zero dawn que tambien es un buen juego tiene el mismo problema que este zelda o me van a decir que no, artisticamente es hermoso y se que la switch puede dar mas en un futuro en graficos, la cantidad de contenido no es tanta como the witcher3 que te abrumas de tanto que hay por hacer, pero si es la suficiente para mantenerte minimo 100hrs jugando si es que te gusta el juego y lo exploras todo lo que puedas, lo recomiendo, pero no es un juego para todos ya que te pide explorar, no te toma de la manita como tiene acostumbrado los juegos hoy en dia",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dankilicious,14-03-2017,"Absolutely a watershed title for open world games. It completely rethinks how a open world should and does work. Everything in the game works exactly as you would expect it to from a physics point of view and it works within the gameplay so well. The game handles scale and discovery unlike anything before it as well (carrot on a stick mechanic is strong here.) The game is so good in fact it almost makes me wonder if I can ever go back to another open world game and truly enjoy myself and this is coming from a pc gamer that plays open world rpg's primarily. I never could've expected this game to be this good and I reccomend anybody to at least pick up a wii u to play it if you can't affor a switch. There is some cons to the game such as a sometimes choppy framerate, some extremely annoying gyroscope puzzles, and weapons breaking can kind of be annoying. However the things the game sets out to do and it just sets so many bars in my opinion for the genre that these little nitpicks are instantly put to the side when you play it and the game is so full of discovery that is genuinely involving and interesting. Seriously I've played this game for 70 hours and I barely even feel like I've done anything in this game. Other developers could only dream of this much fun, unique, and all around solid gameplay. I instantly feel as though this game is going to be a timeless classic that you can come back to for years to come and shows exactly why nintendo is who nintendo is. 10/10 could never give it anything less.

Lightf00t,19-03-2017,"It's really sad to see so many 0/10 and 1/10 reviews on here, which are all from people who don't own a Switch or Wii U and haven't played this game. I just can't understand why 1,592 people hate Nintendo so much that they'd come on here and leave fake reviews to either mislead people or bring down the average score.

I bought a WiiU to play this game to see what all the hype was about. I haven't played a 3D Zelda ever before. For some reason, I didn't expect to like it. I thought the glowing reviews were nostalgia.

Boy, was I wrong. This is, for me, the best game ever made. Nintendo have knocked it out of the park. Don't listen to the whining about framerate issues and pop-in, because they are rare and trivial and do not affect your enjoyment of the game. Do not listen to Jim Sterling, the professional troll, with his fake 7/10 review because he has it in for Nintendo. Don't listen to Slant with their 60% review either, trying to be edgy.

This is a perfect game. That's right. PERFECT. It's the first open world game I've played in which I truly feel free to go anywhere and do anything. I have played for 54 hours and haven't even completed 30% of what's on offer. Everything, from the graphics to the sound design to the plot, is PERFECT.

It's quite clear that Nintendo have stayed true to their roots while also borrowing the best ideas from Western developers. By combining the best of both worlds, they've created a game that's like a combination of Horizon Zero Dawn, Link to the Past, Shadow of the Colossus and a Lord of the Rings movie. It's just incredible.

If you go on Amazon and read reviews from people who're verified purchasers, the average score from users is 99.6%. Yes, that makes it the best game ever. Metacritic is a joke now. They need to introduce a system that makes it mandatory to prove you've purchased the game.

Buy this game. You need it in your life. By the way, the WiiU and Switch versions are for all intents and purposes identical. I've played both.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lone_Wolf_Sones,02-02-2020,"How do you reinvent a 30 year old franchise? That is a question that probably has been asked of other franchises and even younger ones at that. Mario has made several transitions with flying colors. Even Metroid adeptly made its own transition with the Prime series on Gamecube. Zelda too transitioned from A Link to the Past to full 3D with Ocarina of Time on the N64.

Zelda has managed to deliver quality installments with a few changes here or there. But the formula has largely remained the same. There is nothing inherently wrong with this formula. It's worked for as long as the series has been around. So why fix what isn't broken?

The answer is that while the Zelda formula isn't broken and still has a certain charm to it, it has over a period of 30 years begun to become a bit predictable. I still maintain that Zelda OoT is one of the best games ever made. Breath of the Wild inevitably will be compared to other Zelda games and indeed other open world games like Horizon Zero Dawn. Sadly while those older Zelda games may have been a bit predictable? They are certainly more memorable than BotW.

Breath of the Wild completely upends a lot of Zelda's traditional conventions. You still have dungeons, though they are often smaller more bite sized affairs. There are only 4 major dungeons in the form of divine beasts. But with 150 or so shrines which can become repetitive? You start to wish there were more of these elaborate more traditional dungeons.

So how does Breath of the Wild distinguish itself from the countless other open world games on the market? The world itself at times feels like a contradiction. You occasionally find teeming life and other moments find relative emptiness. You face enemies like bokoblins and moblins and more, but the world and the elements as well prove to be worthy adversaries. Lighting can hit you if your wearing metal armor or equipment. Rain makes scaling mountains even more challenging and also annoying. Extreme temperatures also force you to be mindful of the clothing your wearing. All of this is underpinned by an impressive physics system we have never seen in a Nintendo game which allows for open ended puzzle solving.

Visually the game's art style is great and it looks like a painting in motion. It may not be as richly detailed as something like the Witcher 3 or Horizon's more photo realistic visuals. But it still presents a visually striking world that like Windwaker will probably endure the test of time.

The music is an underwhelming disappointment as there really isn't much here. Also disappointing is the lack of narrative. Due to the structure of the game? All the interesting events have already happened in the past making you feel like you'd rather play during those events during this post apocalyptic Hyrule.

Weapon Durability forces you use other stuff that accumulates in your inventory. But this causes a problem as you have to slow down the game, go into an inelegant panel and sift through countless weapons. It also undermined the sense of discovery that I normally would have had attaining a weapon from a chest. I ended up avoiding combat and getting treasure chests as a result because the reward was often not worth the time.

There are issues. The frame rate drops are certainly a concern and I wish they had been able to hit 60 fps. There are some low res textures here and there but they weren't what soured my overall experience. Time will tell if I come to appreciate BotW more. I initially thought it was great but since then the repetition and problems with the narrative really started to grind on me. This was compounded by the season pass that was marketed promising story content which wasn't all that satisfying either.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Clairvoyant5190,13-03-2017,"I'll get this out of the way early; you have to climb...a LOT! I can't tell you the untold minutes I've spent climbing in this game to reach a destination (tiptoeing to avoid spoilers here). And I can't tell you the number of times I've sighed in frustration that I was unable to either a) make said climb or b) kill a(n) group/single enemy.

But you know what? Both of those gripes are okay, because many times they've been the result of my own stupid planning or inexperience with a Zelda game (I've gotten to the Water Temple in Ocarina of Time...that's the furthest I've gotten into a Zelda game before this one).

The graphics are top notch, but we all already knew that. And as some have pointed out, the game does suffer from frame rate issues everyone once in a while (I could probably say less than five occurrences during my easily 24 hours of current playing time, and never in a sticky situation). I have a feeling these issues are due more to the console than the game, but we'll see what Nintendo does with updates.

The gameplay is pretty natural experience once you get the controls down. The fact that there isn't a joystick controlling only movement and the camera is nice (my OoT experience comes via Wii U Virtual Console...you try consistently playing Zelda's Lullaby on damn joystick). Switching weapons is one think that could be improved upon to this player (I played Red Dead Redemption a TON when its online was fully functional, and the wagon wheel was definitely ON POINT!), but that is usually something I'm not having to do in the heat of the moment...and if it is, the game is kind enough to treat the weapon select screen as a pause. So even if you hit the wrong button, it'll only cost you milliseconds.

The quest so far has been mostly unlocking map for me. I've defeated one dungeon (if you can call it that...again, tiptoeing spoilers) and am at a fork where I can choose between more. The game is non-linear as far as the order you complete things, which is very nice! You can do side quests all day, breeze through the main quest, go climb all the things and take in the landscape, however you want to play it!

Before I get too long winded, I'll end it with a TL;DR version.

-The Good: map size (massive), non-linear, engrossing experience, visuals, difficulty balance, use of skills/wit (you'll see), and as always with a Zelda game, creative puzzles

-The Bad: lots of climbing that sometimes can't be avoided

-The Ugly: The amount of plastic wasted by the damn case (hey, I had to use something!)

Final Opinion: As a new Zelda player, I don't have a lot of experience with the series; however, having played this game and the consensus best Zelda game in Ocarina of Time, I definitely must say that Breath of the Wild does it all better, from map, the quest, the characters, and the other odds and ends. I get that this game has 20 years more technological advancement behind it and I'm sure many will cling to their childhood favorites (like SMB3 for me), but there's no way I can put another Zelda game above this one. But hopefully Nintendo green-lights an HD remake of Ocarina of Time on the BotW engine!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Vashu,13-03-2017,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild can be summed up in one word. Phenomenal. Having over 50+ hours into the game, the fact that I have yet to finish even the story, but still feel overwhelmed with the amount of things side quests, and shrines I have yet to do makes this game all that more enjoyable. The graphics may not be 1080p or 4k, but the art style honestly is more fitting with how Legend of Zelda would be perceived in my eyes. The combat is great, and makes the game challenging, and not a cake walk. Some of the dungeons/ shrines really get's your mind active with how you may need to figure a puzzle out, and I can say that with 50+ hours and only having completed 44/100+ is crazy. While the open world, explore how you please aspect is probably one the most intuitive and well applied features I may have seen reminding me of games such as Grand theft auto, Elder scrolls series, and Assassin's creed games. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has won Game of the Year for me at least.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Slingblade1170,13-03-2017,"Wow! I had high expectations and it still exceeded them. I waited a week before giving my opinion on the game and I can honestly say it's in the top 3 games I've ever played. It's beautiful, unique and has a million little details. I love the side quests and working to make my character stronger with every shrine.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
herukun,13-03-2017,"It's a fantastic game. Exploration is captivating and actually better done than most current-gen open world games. Shrines offer a good variety of short puzzles that keep the gameplay engaging and not a long slog like some previous Zelda dungeons (lolwatertemple).

However, if exploration and open world are not your thing, I would reluctantly advise you to purchase another game. While the games absolutely nails those aspects, there are a few things the game fell short for me in other departments.

Combat: I see the merits and the frustrations of having durability on weapons. It forces variety in combat styles and gives more reason to explore and discover new weapons. However, new players might find the system off-putting, as the durability system constantly breaks low level weapons (you might get a few hit on an enemy before the weapon breaks, no joke). While this improves as your progress through the game, it still felt like there wasn't enough room for the weapons I found. The limited weapon space + high turnover rate of weapons can be frustrating at times. When it comes to actual combat, there are many different ways to tackle enemies. Throw bombs? Wait until they fall asleep? Shoot a fire arrow at that explosive barrel? Use magnises to drop a heavy boulder on them? The game allows for a variety of possibilities, and it's rather refreshing. However, when it comes to using weapons, the controls can feel unresponsive. Perhaps I have been spoiled by SoulsBorne, Bayonetta, DMC, and other hack n' slash/action rpgs, but the sword/stick/whatever combat feels archaic, for lack of better terms. Only one input to attack, and dodging is limited to running and blocking and ..well that's about it. See, while you can sidestep and backflip, the controls are unresponsive at times and the animation is s l o w. also, it's almost as though link backflips in place. He doesn't go anywhere. You're still going to get hit. I would've much rather had the rolls from the other zelda games than jump. I understand the jump is used for climbing walls, but you could substitute the roll with a ""grab/latch"" input when near a climbable wall.
tl;dr close range combat feels clunky and unresponsive.

Story: this is probably the most subjective thing, so I'll keep it short. The story wasn't bad, but it wasn't very captivating. There wasn't much of a sense of fulfillment or achievement in progressing through the story and completing the few dungeons the game has to offer. Compared to previous Zeldas, I found the narrative lacking.

Progression: In BoTW, you progress at your own pace. This is both fantastic and disappointing, depending on how you look at it. In modern day gaming, people seem to think linearity in games is bad. I feel that this is true in some titles, but Zelda has always handled this well. Completing dungeons gave a sense of accomplishment in previous Zelda titles because of the tools and weapons you would acquire that would allow you to advance to the next segment of the game, and allowed for more variety in puzzles. In BoTW, there are no tools to be acquired for progression. You want to fight Ganon immediately? You can! You don't want to do that dungeon/shrine? Then don't! This freedom is liberating to an extent, but then as you play, you begin to question: what's the point of exploring this mountain? To get to the top and find a korok seed I don't care about? To find a weapon that'll break while fighting some enemies shortly after? The excitement of exploration wears off after a while, and when that's gone, this game has little else to offer.

In the end, this game is definitely worth buying and playing through the end. However, it does have it's flaws and at times I wonder; This game is amazing, but is it an amazing ZELDA game? Because there were many times playing this where I actually forgot I was playing a Zelda game. Take what you will with that information.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

CorLink14,20-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is an amazing game and the best I've played since Ocarina of Time. While I wouldn't say it's surpassed it's predecessor, that doesn't prevent it from being close. In fact, if they'd sorted out my one problem with this game, I would honestly say it's just as good if not better than Ocarina. What Breath of the Wild does so well includes; the new combat style that troduces unique new features that the series has never seen, i.e, flurry rushing, the difficulty creates a real sense of urgency, particularly in losing battles (which you will be seeing a lot of, by the way), the artstyle really engages the player to explore the beautiful landscapes of Hyrule, the dungeons are short yet still creative, the shrines go way out of their way to reward you with only the best of trinkets in the kingdom, the story's lacking in some departments but heart-wrenching all the same, the music could've been better but seeing as they were going for an ambient-style game, I can't complain, and best of all, there is so much to do. Hyrule is teeming with detail, in animals, in your surroundings, in NPCs, literally anywhere you look you will see exactly why this game has had numerous delays over the last two years. The physics engine is genius, and the controls may be alien at first, but you settle in quicker than you think.
Onto the list of flaws. As I said before, Ocarina of Time is the most flawless game ever created, and while Breath of the Wild may be amazing, it's not perfect. The frame-rate definitely has issues, the worst I had were in areas such as Death Mountain where so much was going on at once that the game actually froze for a few seconds before picking back up. I never really minded this, as I haven't ever been too big on graphics in the past, but if you are, then bare that in mind as you play. Now, my one issue with this game is regarding the antagonist, Ganon. Literally NOTHING is known about him in this game, and if you're new to the series, first off, where have you been for the past thirty years, and second, you'll finish the game wondering who it was you just took down. Ganon's objectives in this game were never explained, and this really disappointed me, especially after how deep the series was getting into story during Skyward Sword.
All in all, Breath of the Wild is a near-perfect game. It's not quite there yet, but it's closer than humanity's gotten for almost twenty years. Definitely pick it up when you get the chance because I can guarantee that you will not be disappointed.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
toonlinkman,31-08-2017,"I really enjoyed this game. After 120 hours of playing it I'm finally losing the addiction and can reflect on it with less bias. If you asked me six weeks ago I would have said it was the best game ever. Now I would say it is probably the best Zelda game. I enjoyed it more than Skyrim, which I enjoyed more than the witcher 3.

I liked the concept of shrines and divine beasts. Some of the side quests are a bit boring. After first completing the game I felt very underwhelmed with the story. It was nothing like the rollercoaster of emotions in skyward sword. This was because I hadn't uncovered all the memories which are hard to find. Having now completed all shrines and found all memories I'm much more happy, although I now have a huge void with what to do with my time, as every other switch game is terrible in comparison.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hang gliding is fun, but climbing mountains is not. Weapons constantly break. The open world is barren, empty and uninspiring.

- Story/Quests
Is there a story in it ? The story is optional, practically non-existent, and **** dialogues. The characters are empty, and the quests are more boring than fun.
1/10

- Combat
At first, I found the generic type combat system quite fun. Due to the weapon durability at the beginning of the game, we need to change the weapon quite often, so we learn to use them all. After a few hours, it's just a pain to use a low power weapon, because the nice ones are broken.
First few hours : ""Nice, new enemy type""
After 4-5 hours of game-play, you know all the different types of enemies (10 at most), and these enemies are the same until the end of the game (and even after).
The combats are quite easy when you learn how to use your parade on each enemy, and some of them are scary at first, but after a few hours, you are almost invincible if you know that you are doing !
3/10

Design :
What can i say ? It's amazing, beautiful colors, no lags, perfect. If you want a game just for the design and nothing else, it's the perfect game
10/10

Puzzles(shrines) :
After Ocarina of time, i was expecting some good puzzle games. But no ! It's a ""puzzle"" with a huge room and 1 big enemy, or an easy dungeon when you just need to use the skills you found in the game, that last 10 min max. Only a few of them were fun (2 shrines to do at the same times, with for info on each one to unlock the other)
2/10

What to do in the game ?
- 4 dungeon with bosses + end boss, with almost no scenario
- 100+ useless or easy shrine
- a few hundreds korok seeds to find
So, except the 4 ""scenario"" dungeon"", that are optional and without real story, the only thing you do in the game is trying to find the small easy shrines (puzzles), and trying to find completely useless leaf under each rock etc. If you only want a nice looking game, it's perfect, but it's an over rated game with a terrible story and nothing to do except doing cartography",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bunniesaregreat,16-01-2019,"If it were possible to give a 2 word review, I'd say: ""Absolutely Empty"". The world feels super huge for no real purpose.

It looks ok but not that awesome, the music is decent but forgettable, plot isn't even a plot (I wouldn't even be able to spoil anything since it has absolutely no developpment, you're given a situation and it wont change), characters are walking clichés.

Coming to what's supposed to be the main point of this game: exploring. It just feels purposefully limited. The game wants you to explore by not giving you any precise objectives but will also prevent you from reaching some places because, well, you're still supposed to explore specific places first. Stamina, which is supposedly made to prevent you from climbing absolutely anything, just feels like a pain when it forces you to run for 3 seconds and then walk twice as much time to get it back, everything is just SO SLOW. Don't even consider riding a horse to go faster and forget about stamina, they are terribly designed and tend to get stuck for stupid reasons, such as being near a wall. You can also drown if you swim for too long, which makes sense (even though you drown after swimming up to 50 meters but eh), so if you want to move on water, there's boats ! And of course, they're also really slow and way too large to be usable, getting stuck in weird places for no reason. Fighting is very repetitive, and since it's rarely mandatory and breaks your weapon, avoiding monsters often tends to be the best thing to do. Puzzles are designed in order to be understandable by toddlers.
Everything in the game feels slow. Dialogue is slow (and most likely useless), reaching a place is slow, climbing is OVERLY SLOW; I even got the feeling that skipping a cinematic was slow.
It also feels like there is too much of everything. If you hide 900 Korok seeds, it's impossible to be creative in hiding all of them. If you try to create 100 different shrines with very limited ways of resolving them, they will all feel the same. Controls aren't intuitive at all, and even menus hardly make sense. You basically have a real ""menu"" with your equipment, saving, etc. and a second one with the map and a page that gives information about what you've gathered. Wouldn't just having one menu with everything listed in it be easier to use? This is hard to describe but it just isn't natural when you get your hands on it.

And more importantly: There is no feel of progression through the game.

The game also has weird technical problems. I experienced FPS drops a bunch of times on a brand new Switch in Dock Mode (which sounds like the most powerful way to run this game atm), and really long loading screens.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

azzazin,05-03-2017,"I think we got another GTA 4 on our hands...

This game has been overhyped by nearly everyone, there's been a lot of 9/10 10/10 reviews out there but is it really all warranted. This game just like GTA 4 is getting raving reviews and people are ignoring some real glaring issues with this game.

First lets talk about the biggest issue with this game that everyone seems to ignore and that is the performance with this game. I'm not the only one seeing the issue prop up, maybe is because I'm primarily a PC gamer and I play my games mostly at 60 fps, but I can tell that Botw has been dipping well below 30 when it comes large amount of enemies, explosion, large amount of trees/buildings. It really takes me out of the game every time the game dips into the 10s/20s fps regularly. How do these reviewers ignore this glaring technical flaw, Nintendo usually focuses of good performance in their games except when it comes to Zelda for some reason.

Gameplay:

The combat is fun, exploring is fun, the food crafting system is bad, and the shrines are bad. The food crafting in this games was good up until you need to craft a lot of food and that when it gets bad, there is no way to craft of bunch of food in a reasonable amount of time, it just takes too long.

The shrines are really repetitive and are tied to the open world aspects of other games, they are like mini dungeons with a small puzzle that you need to do over and over again. Basically that's how you level up in this game. 4 shrines gives you a heart or stamina bar and they are not very challenging and are considered the filler content of this open world game. There are only 4 real dungeons in this game and they have been pretty meh. Basically this game's core gameplay can be summed up with you looking for towers to unlock the map and also doing the shrines so you can level up. This gameplay is found in other games and is not a whole lot different than any other open world game out there, this type of gameplay can be very polarizing because a lot of people do enjoy this type of ,what I call, ""filler content"". This isn't ""new and innovative"", is as if people have never played another open world game. Witcher 3 did it better, skyrim did it better; those games hid it better. If you played games like the new Farcry and Assassins Creed you know how well it can get repetitive. just because Zelda does it doesn't mean its amazing.

The soundtrack:

The soundtrack isn't bad but it isn't good either. No song really sticks in my head like majoras mask theme or skyward song theme. Most of the songs here are just calm music except when you enter normal combat and then it is combat music. These songs really disappoint me because it doesn't make me feel like an adventurer, I feel like i need to go to sleep.

Art/Graphics:

Art is really good here especially when looking out into the distance but is bad when you stare at rocks while climbing and it really shows how old this game feels even though is supposed to be a brand new shiny console with brand new shiny graphics, and it still struggles to maintain frame rate.

Voice Acting:

This one really irks me. Zelda finally has voice acting and they still use text for most of the game. Why did they even hire voice actors if they were never going to use them for most of the game, its just so baffling, like what exactly is the point. They went ahead and borrowed things from other games but they didn't borrow something like witcher 3 dialogue production (or mass effect).

Overall it's important to be able to see beyond the eyes of a fanboy. I'm a big GTA fan and I saw the issues it had. It didn't have all that much replay-ability (single player) and driving sucked. It was still a good game but it just wasn't a ""10/10 hype!!!"" game, just as zelda is not a perfect 10/10 game. This game has flaws and its time to acknowledge those flaws.

In a real score 10/10 system I would give this game a 6/10 but since gamers only know the ign review score system, this game is an 8/10. Above average is what this game is. I don't consider it a system seller but that's just me.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Dalith14,06-03-2017,"(SWITCH VERSION)
THE GOOD:

from a technical standpoint this game is astonishing. The game truly gives you unlimited freedom as the player, and not only that but the world itself interacts with the player, whether it be through the weather or terrain.

The Shrines you visit (Their are a lot) are truly entertaining as each one is typically a puzzle that requires you to use multiple abilities to solve, and more times than not you can solve in more than one way.

While the story itself requires you to flesh it out, it is a very enjoyable story and probably the most well told in the series.

THE BAD:

With this being a massive open world, it is also a massive barren world with little incentive to explore every nook and cranny. All the equipment in the game can be obtained through shops (With the exception of about 6 pieces in shrines) and the few areas you find that are guarded by enemies or require some clever routing to get to often reward you with a chest that has arrows or other negligible items.

The cooking system is cluttered and unnecessary and the time required to cook detracts from the enjoyment of the game.

The controls could of been much more refined and can lead to some silly mishaps.

THE UGLY:

The FPS is extremely inconsistent.

The beautiful music of the Zelda series we have grown to love is very scarce in this installment (This is most likely due to the developer wanting you to enjoy the ""ambiance"")

Pop in textures are extremely common.

Overall I have really enjoyed my time with the game and I plan on putting in much more, however I do not believe this to be the masterpiece it is touted as, but I do believe it is the framework to something truly amazing in the future.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Frostbyte57,14-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the game Zelda fans and gamers have dreamed about, a true open world adventure experience in the Zelda series that feels alive and moving just like the Switch and its truly verstial play styles. There is never a dull moment whenever I play this game. For instance I would be following a quest and on my route to complete the quest I usually find a new shrine to clear and receive a new Spirit Orb that increases my health or stamina when I gather 4 of them and take them to a goddess statue, a new side quest, a Korok puzzle that I need to solve so I can increase my inventory, a puzzle shrine hidden that I need to solve to make it appear, a mini boss with really good weapons, materials nearby that I'm going to need to upgrade my armor, a dragon that has rare materials that I can use to upgrade my armor or sell for a really high price, an item or creature I want to take a picture of and add to my compendium in case I need to track it later with the Sheikah Slate, or a chest nearby that might have a good weapon, a rare jewel, or a lot of money just laying their hidden in the ground, water, or on top of a enemy outpost, under a movable rock, or block of ice and all of that is not even half this game. There are so many sets of armors, shields, and weapons each with different effects and abilities that can make the difference between surviving or dying, and you aren't limited when it comes to your equipment. Link is fully customizable meaning you can create him to look the way you want with so many styles and color variations to choose from with the addition to armors and outfits from previous Zelda titles such as the Original NES outfit, both Link and Dark Link outfits from Ocarina of Time, the Windwaker outfit and shield, the Skyward Sword outfit, and even the Fierce Deity Outfit and the Double Helix Sword. And the story is so beautiful and compelling that you just want to know how its going to end. This game is all about survival and you can hunt for, cook, and combine so many different recipes together that create meals and elixirs that can replenish massive amounts of health and/or give you a boost or resistance to a certain element. And at almost every moment in the game the music is always taking your breath away and it blends so well with each of the games different environments. No longer is there a side kick that is constantly annoying you, but instead you can have Wolf Link from Twilight Princess join you and can be called out using the Wolf Link amiibo anytime out in the wilderness to help you hunt animals or find secrets that he can sense nearby. And finally there is a Zelda game that is so open, massive, and that you can literally.... climb.... anything... on... the... map. This game alone deserves the title and award of being best game of 2017 because it has revolutionized the way we see open world adventure games. I give this game a 10 out of 10.

I love the atmosphere in Breath of the Wild and as a long time fan of the series I am very happy to have not been disappointed. The music, the art style, the tight controls all lend themselves to a game that is accessible to all players.

Kawooster,11-03-2017,"This review will more than likely end up lost in the thousands of others, but I just had to make one. I just finished the game as recently as an hour ago. Of course not 100% But fought my way to the final boss, which required me to invest over 60 hours into the game. So, I believe my review on this from my side of things will be more than valid.

To Start off, does this game really deserve the praise and constant 10/10 ratings? The answer to that is......No, it does not. Does that mean that it deserves a 5 or even a 6 like some people have been given it.....No, it also does not.

I feel the hype to this game and how amazing the game is for the first 30 or so hours, inflated the score to much higher than it should be....Oh yeah, it's also a Zelda game......that too.

It's definitely a huge step away from a traditional Zelda game, as many already know. This isn't a bad thing, I couldn't stop playing this game since I received it at launch with my Nintendo Switch. There is a interesting charm and play style to this game that makes it difficult to put down the control. The world and scenery is gorgeous and the unlimited play options will make it a joy to play for many hours, even days, to come.

Figuring out the best possible way to take enemies on is a whole game in itself. Do you come in swinging or pick them off one by one with your bow? The choice is yours, and there's an unlimited amount of possibilities. As you progress you become stronger and stronger, which makes even the toughest of enemies that much easier to take down. With your arsenal of possibilities, even a fight that seems impossible may turn out in your favor.

The side quests are fruitful, with some of them being much longer than an actual part of your main quest line. The side characters are also very well thought out, and have great depth and character (Most of them)
The shrines you find scattered out in the world are interesting. Some of them can be very challenging and may take upwards of 20 minutes and a fair amount of brain power. Others, my seven year old nephew could finish in a minute or two (True story)
All in all, the shrines are a very nice addition and can be a nice break from the constant threat of enemies trying to end your life every few minutes.

But....That's where the fun ends.

Did these reviewers completely overlook this games obvious shortcomings on purpose? Did they ignore them? Did they have their filthy hands in Nintendo's pockets too deep? Or did they completely avoid mentioning them for the sake of being a complete and utter ""Zelda fanboy""?
I love Zelda, always have and always will. But to deny this games shortcomings, is well.......A shortcoming in itself, isn't it....?

To begin. Why are their no temples? Why on earth in a Zelda game isn't there a single god damn temple!?
That's like eating a Peanut butter and Jelly sandwich, without any Jelly.
It's like having a $2000 Gaming computer, but it runs on Windows 98
It's like trying to play a guitar, but the guitar has no strings...Anyway, catch my drift?

The Divine beasts are not temples! I'll say it again. The Divine beasts, are NOT TEMPLES....
You know what they are? A single room, with a few puzzles....A glorified shrine.
I feel like Nintendo concentrated so much on freedom and ridiculous weapons that break in about three hits (Don't even get me started on that) That they forgot about a key Zelda ingredient...Temples or dungeons, what ever you want to call them.
How can they forget something that makes Zelda so great?
Look, I like the divine beasts, but come one, nothing beats a good ol' Forest Temple or Shadow Temple. By the end of it, I would have even been happy with a Water Temple, that's how much I was missing a proper Temple.
Can you really consider a temple, something you can finish in 15 minutes? Seriously, the stupid Elephant one took me 15 minutes to do, 20 including the boss.
What a let down....

The Story......Wait, what story? The attempted story is atrocious, along with the so called voice acting, which is so cringe worthy that you would rather skip it than sit through another moment.

So, you beat Calamity Ganon, then what? Absolutely nothing......No, seriously...Nothing. No special weapon, no special shield, no special item...Nothing.
The game actually makes you load in from your last save before beating him if you want to continue playing.
........I know, ridiculous, right?
What's the point of beating him, why even bother with it? You shouldn't bother with it. The boss fight wasn't even amazing. I had tougher fights with some random enemies scattered through out the world.

This review has gotten too long and I don't have many characters left, so I'll have to stop with the complaining there.

This isn't a 10/10 game, but it definitely deserves at least an 8/10. Though, I'll be giving it a 10/10 on here, to counteract all the lame ass people giving it a 0/10 and they haven't even played it..

luminaxster,27-03-2017,"Since Ocarina of time, I have not been so mind blown by game. Batman: Arkham Asylum, and City as a bundle come really close to it, but the replay value and game mechanisms aside fighting were on a middle ground. The art is impeccable, the game mechanics are incredible addictive, and the open-air flow of the history-upgrade-skill make this game a whole puzzle that from every angle has a different way to approach it. I have enjoyed the 150+ hours I have played it, still missing 10 shrines and 20 Koroks, though.

The art was conceived to be everlasting, they used the Windwaker style to do so. The scenography, such blend between japanese anime and real world' beauty is breath-taking. Miyasaki's renown art style has a huge footprint here. This difference between Japan and the West art philosophy makes this game timeless. Hyper-realism of the West make their art to be limited by the hardware resources of the time, with the exception of animatronics.

Sometimes overlook by players and developers alike, weapons break there are no silver bullets. This foundation for playing the game drives everything, from exploring regions to choosing your fights (or avoiding them) to decide whether your are ready to fulfill your destiny. Once you got weapons, how many can you hold, how many do you need to get things done on a quest? you have to explore to get Korok seeds so you can carry more. Then, you learn how weapons, armor, other items and the environment work, so you know where to go and keep at hand. The game mechanics are so intuitive and connected to its open world that you forget that you actually cannot do that in the rest of the games you play. I cannot recommend this game more. Please, put skepticism and ill-advises aside, once you take a breath of the wild, you know there is not going back.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Furious_Fanboy,04-04-2017,"Finally a Zelda game that doesn't feel like a chore to complete! I loved every minute of this game. My only MINOR complaints I have: I would have liked more of a musical score for the game, and Thunderblight Ganon was tougher than the main boss. Overall it is a masterpiece of a game!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
neosim,25-03-2017,"Bad things first: First impression was kind of confusing same for the controls. The enemies get recycled often. Calling horses when they are out of range doesn't work (realistic? yes, fun? no). Yes the world is as open as it could be, but alot of it is locked behind having to get better equipment. Weapons breaking is annoying (but also forces you to try new ones).
After a few hours tough you'll get used to the mechanics and the controller and an amazing World awaits you. The map is enormous and there are countless weapons, materials, shields et cetera. Definitely amazing if you are a bit of a loot whore. Traveling around takes a bit of time at first, until you unlock the port locations. No place feels like the other and surprises wait around every corner like a cave locked behind breakable stones filled with gems, a random bird bard on a mountain or a giant dragon suddenly appearing. There are secrets hidden everywhere and they actually provide something worthwhile if you find many of them instead of simply being something to collect. The puzzles are fun and become quite tricky later on. Combat changed a lot instead of a static damage number like most zelda games you now have countless weapon types and weapon multipliers like food giving attack strength and so on. I also like that the game rarely explains stuff, you have to find your way through most the game by yourself only hints are hidden in lore, no hand-holding. Rupees are actually worth something in this game, never once encountered a point where money didn't matter (looking at you ocarina of time).

TLDR; This game is amazing, but amazing enough to buy an entire console going with it? Debatable, if you are a Nintendo fan, plan on getting stuff like super mario odyssey and you enjoy the ""switch"" part (gotta say it's actually a huge improvement in quality of life imo, using it a lot) then definitely yes. If you only plan on playing Zelda then i'd say wait until the console gets cheaper. But nonetheless anyone not playing this game is missing out, very great experience. I'd rate it 8.2-8.5 but gave it a 9 for changing the formula.

Oh and everybody giving this game a score of 4 and less is objectively an idiot. Most of them can be summed up like this: ""WÄHHH IT'S NOT THE ZELDA I LIKED/USED TO KNOW THINGS CHANGED AND I DON'T LIKE IT THUMBS DOWN EVERYBODY"". Please for the love of god ignore them.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Malovi,31-03-2017,"Cannot recommend this game more highly - it is genuinely just a lot of fun to play.

The world is polished and clearly hand-crafted: just full of things for you to see and discover, whatever direction you set out in.

The AI for both enemies and NPCs alike is believable and coupled with well animated characters provides for a depth of character that is truly a joy.

The combat, magic and physics systems all interlock and work together to create a very smooth and dynamic system where you can have some real fun pushing the envelope on what is possible.

Nydhogg,12-03-2017,"This is not by any means a perfect game, nor the best game ever, not even the best in the franchise (which is in fact my favourite). After spending somewhere between 100 and 200 hours I can't help but feel that Nintendo tried their best to change what was wrong with Skyward Sword, while changing what was ultimately right as well. While the latter had a strict closed world, with no connections between areas which were no more than 3 besides the sky, Breath of the Wild offers a world like no other Zelda game before it, or any other game period. However, it faills where Skyward Sword succeded; its characterization that only gets worse through the awfull voice acting (mainly Zelda's) and poor story telling. By the end of the game I felt ultimately disappointed by how simple (even by the franchise's standards) the story was, how shallow its conclusion seemed, how I simply could feel nothing for its characters. The premise of a ruined kingdom and the quest to regain the memory is a good one but that's all there is to it - a lot of promises with no acomplishment... I kept hoping that by the end there would be some light shed into everything, something to connect to other games, or at least to the Ganon's character like we had in Wind Waker or in Twilight Princess, something to redeem the game, to make it feel more deep, but Ganon is the epytome of what the story is, completely shallow, if this was my first Legend of Zelda I wouldn't understand what this all was for, since its character lacks any reason and to be honest, Ganondorf did more in 7 years in Ocarina of Time than Calamity Ganon did in 100...
Then there is the problem of the dungeons... The few ones (four) there are, feel really natural since there are no keys, the map makes much sense in the kind of world this is, there's some fluidity to it... However they all look the same, for all the variety the overworld has, the dungeons are always machines, and that's not the only think the seem to differ from the overworld. They are really tiny dungeons only bigger then the lackluster shrines all over the game (and I went through all of them). There are no theme dungeons like in previous games, the big challenge that we were always looking to. Majora's Mask also had 4 dungeons but at least they felt unique, and the overworld wasn't so disproportionate to them. Furthermore, the bosses all looked the same, only changing the weapon they used. And their level of difficulty was a shame when we consider how hard some battles can be in the overworld, particularly the last transformation of Calamity Ganon... neither one of them hold the candle to Lynels...
The other thing that bugged me was that for all the diversity and area of the overworld, I felt like all I found were different varieties of bokoblins, moblins and lizalfos, not even flying lizalfos at that... And the mini bosses were even more repetitive, not to talk about how Talus were just... a big rock...
The weapon mechanic can be a pain in the ass at the beggining of the game but we eventually overcome it and it's this game thing, you either get used to it or not. Don't think that's a bad thing like most people seem to complain about.
It's soundtrack is there even if most of the time it is way more subtle than in previous games, there are some nice pieces throughout the game.
Artistically is an authentic masterpiece and I don't think I will get marvelled by another game's scenarios like I was by this ones in a while.
There are a lot of frame drops but I don't think they are that bad that you can't enjoy the game for what it is. Sometimes I felt like the controls didn't respond that well, not sure if it was the game or switch's problem...Link would keep moving even when I stopped or changed direction or not move immediately when I ordered him to, but since I saw no one complaining about it I have to assume it may have been a problem with my controller.
In conclusion, in spite of all its problems with the story, dungeons, characterization, I think the game is truly groundbreaking when it comes to its freedom, gameplay and art style so I'm giving what I believe to be a fair score: an 8 (8,5 if I could but never a 9)",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
vora_bat,01-01-2018,"The main problem i have with this game, is that they've fooled me during the start of it. I liked it a lot in the beginning. They've created a start area in a such way, that it felt really detailed and with a lot of interesting places. But what appeared to be after that in a reality was an empty world, with boring side quests, boring cities. and repetitive tiny dungeons. I don't mind the visual style of the game, since it felt fine. What i dislike is that i was really bored after 10+ hours in game. I kinda get why a lot of people give this game 10 out of 10, because most likely it was their first game, but it is definitely not 10 out of 10.

The world and environment are so well designed and every new area is different than the last. You can go anywhere you see. Gripping story covered in a shroud of mystery.

Dacx,06-03-2017,"Not completed it yet and I hope it never ends. This game is 'once in a decade' good. The old masters have come out again and proved what can be done in the genre defining title.

At first I was a little daunted by the vast openness of it all and though it would get boring. Never been into open world games. Soon you realise that, as beautiful as it is and as vast there is so much to do. You are only limited by your creativity. Those who have not found this enjoyable are used to games on rails where the scripted action comes to you. Press x to grieve.

The game is tough as nails which is surprising for a Zelda title. Like how you can go straight for the castle (and get your arse handed to you like mine was) and how non-existant the tutorial is. Best played with as little spoiler guides as possible. Throw yourself in there and figure it out, the world will reveal it to you eventually. In fact you should stop reading these reviews, no more YouTube video's either.

Organic gameplay at it's best. Multiple ways to solve a puzzle/problem in this epic sandbox environment. Rather than fight a group of enemies directly (and likely loose) I managed to light on fire one of their own weapons I found lying against a cook stove after I sneaked in close. Threw it like a javelin, just as they wised up to me and started to grab weapons to charge me down. It landed between them igniting some poorly placed explosives (they should have really worked on their camp design). Blew them all to hell! One of the most satisfying gameplay experiences I've ever had.

In short I can't stop thinking about this game and should get back to work. Thankfully I can now even play it on the way home.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It's open world, but not just open world. Like the Witcher 3 was pretty open, but I honestly don't care about Geralt. Fallout has the same problem, the main character is simply not important.

And well, I have to just mention that this game REALLY lives up to the hype around it, if not exceeded.
Why a perfect 10? Anyone that hasn't played this game may be very sceptic, although let me just state a few things:
- I've played a LOT of open world games
- I've played a lot of Zelda games
- I've never been this addicted to wanting to play a game in ages.

And this game just simply has such tuned mechanics, making it addicting:
every mechanic is made to be supporting each other, same goes for the shrines, dungeons and main story line quests. And the accomplishment you feel when you've ANYTHING in this game is incredible.
Let's just say for comparison it's more satisfying as stardew valley or harvest moon, because of it's extremely smart game play design.

Lastly go into this game with NOTHING, literally nothing: know as less as you can before starting the game, because that's what's the game is about really: learning it all by yourself being link.

NPC dialogue is also very in depth. If you try to jump off a bridge while you're next to an NPC, he'll plead for you not to do it. You can really tell that Nintendo put in the work for this game.

Scrubtart,12-03-2017,"I honestly have to temper my enthusiasm about this game and sit back and think about it to not immediately give it a ten.
Once critical thought is applied you see that this game is heavily inspired by pre-existing concepts from the rpg genre of video games like skyrim, dark souls among others. However, these concepts are expertly integrated and polished to a fine sheen. This game feels like the culmination of years of open world games in that it feels like one of the few games in the genre to truly capture what open world games should be about. Exploration, discoveries, loot, and just an overall freedom of play. This game doesn't seem to discourage any kind of playstyle and in fact seems to encourage all of them. Its easy enough to seek out the core story and run right to main quests if you so desire but if you explore naturally these parts of the game will organically reveal themselves to you as well.

People complain about the graphics in this game. I will never understand it. Look up some screenshots from the game. Beautiful sweeping landscapes that approximate real world environments giving it the same feel that makes a sunset over the mountains irl beautiful. Other games like final fantasy turn to unrealistic worlds that do look beautiful but something about how natural and alive the world feels in BotW grips me. I will spend countless hours exploring the surprisingly populated gigantic map and coaxing out all of this game's secrets.

While critically this game may not make many landmark advances for the genre, I cannot deny its just plain fun! I have a blast playing BotW and I'm not going to pretend I need anything more from a video game,

If you look at a lot of these 0 score reviewers, just check their other reviews. it seems the release of horizon zero dawn (which I can make no claims about until I play it) has generated some unfriendly competition for some reason.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ragz101,12-03-2017,"I have actually played this game. Bought a Switch and the game and I've sunk close to 60+ hours into it and can give spoilers to prove it.
I am giving this game a 10 out of 10. maybe like a 9.7 if you wanna be super picky about it. but since there's no decimal system here im rounding up because it deserves it.

Dispel the rumors that this game is too ""hand holdy"" or other such nonsense peddled by PlayStation Fanboys or people trying to ""balance"" the reviews. This game is a masterpiece. In the technical department i have found no glitches, game breaking or otherwise, and the frame rate problems reported by early reviewers have largely been patched by the day one update to the point of being no longer noticeable for the most part.

As far as the game itself story, graphics, gameplay, scale, and scope: this game is a masterpiece or near masterpiece. Now, let me get this out of the way. This story is fantastic for what it needs to be. this is not Mass Effect. Like any Zelda game it's primarily self contained, not a vast story branching several games to create a cinematic masterclass for the ages. That being said, the story to this game, told in an interesting non linear fashion, is still great. probably one of the best stories Nintendo has ever put out and certainly one that actually gives characters CHARACTER. The non linear mode of storytelling is actually one that fits this game rather well, as many plot points are connected to others, but not chronologically. and what points are in a specific chronological order are fun do discover and will be enough to keep achievement hunters happy, despite the fact that Nintendo has no achievement system. The voice acting is something that, for the most part, is well done. there are one or two characters who's voice acting is a bit flat and a lot of that has to do with the fact that this is a dubbed game made in Japan. the Japanese voice acting probably fits the character's speech pattern better but I dont know, I don't speak Japanese. But the few faults in the voice acting are rendered pretty inconsequential as for the most part the voice acting that is there is good and voice acting is not the only/main form of dialogue (Nintendo does love their text box dialogue, and some traditions don't need to be broken).

Gameplay and Graphics: The art style is amazing. A lot of people are complaining about this and that its not as realistic as many new gen games are (such as the new PS game Horizon). But i learned that this particular issue is null. Stylized graphics will help this game in the long run and it will age beautifully. This artstyle makes the game feel like playing through a brilliantly made painting in the best way. Wind Waker came out almost 15 years ago and it still looks gorgeous, thanks to its highly stylized graphics, meanwhile games like Resident Evil 4 don't look so good by comparison. Breath of the Wild has found a near perfect balance between beautiful stylized graphics and HD oriented detail. Gameplay is fluid, fun, crisp, and intuitive. At first the motion control feels a little invasive, until you've played it for more than 2 hours and then try it without the motion controls, you will find the lack of fine tuning using a simple tilt of the wrist is sorely missed. This is probably one of Zelda's best combat systems. Perfect dodges and parries reward those of us with innate timing abilities, but you don't need to be a master of timing to survive or even thrive in this game. Climbing ( a main mechanic, believe me) is well done. the only awkward controls i've found were the horse riding, which ceased to be awkward withing 10 minutes of using it.

The scale and scope of this game is simply massive. There is no better way to put it. Massive in the best way. Not only do you feel like this game is bigger than the likes of Skyrim (you can really feel the fact that the overworld is 3x the size) but it looks amazing. the scale of the world is balanced in such a way that everything looks accessible but once you start your journey you realize just how far away it is. I thought the beginning area of the game was pretty big at first, now after discovering the entire map it looks tiny by comparison. Not only is the world massive, but its teaming with life and things to do. entire sections of the map are set up for new challenges. 900 Korok puzzles and 120 shrines more than make up for the lower amount of dungeons, and while some of the main dungeons are easier than others, they all pose a unique challenge and bring something new to the Zelda table, which is an intimidating task considering the fame of Ocarina of Time's Water Temple is among them.

This game is a masterpiece, a watershed moment for a series that has been putting out hit after hit for over 30 years. i give it a 10/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Cheeps,13-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild proves that Nintendo still knows their way around an open world adventure game. The graphics, while not quite as good as those on competing consoles, still hold up very well and look spectacular. The story is not as in-depth as some were hoping, however it does still fit in nicely with the Zelda package. My only real complaints about this game are the music and the fps. The music in past Zelda games has always been so vibrant and alive. In this game, there is a faint pitter of piano notes now and again, but no real soundtrack until a major event is unfolding. The fps also bothers me. In most cases it is fine, the game is nice and smooth, but in almost all villages there is a very noticeable drop. For these reasons, I'm giving this game a 9/10.

zerox50,17-03-2017,Many people are having mixed feelings about this games score . That being said games are all about preference and taste. I will admit that while much of the story and fantasy setting don't appeal to me it was still overall a great game. The mechanics are polished the controls are tight (horse riding aside) even the ridiculously flimsy weapon durability isn't a turn off. (although I wouldn't complain if they patched all weapons later to be 5x more durable) At its core this game takes a lot of different systems and cobbles them together more or less successfully.

SacredFroakie,23-03-2017,"This game defines the definition of a Open world videogame. You can litterally do anything, from getting swarmed my hundreds of chickens to battling giant rock bosses. The story is amazing! Zelda herself has an amazing personality. Not to mention the final boss is very good and the music is tremendous. Not only that, but it has 120 mini dungeons(or shrines) you get to complete to collect hearts or stamina. There are also 4 main, beautifully designed main dungeons. If you love the elder scrolls series this game is certainly the game for you. Obviously, no game is perfect so keep that in mind. If I could give an exact score it would be a 95. Making it my favorite videogame surpassing other amazing game like skyrim. I'm not a big zelda fan, this game changed me. Ever since I saw this game at e3 last year, I was shocked at how beautiful it looked. Over the holidays I played The legend of Zelda wind waked, which is amazing. Not only did I get an amazing experience from BOTW, but I was introduced to a franchise I pushed aside. Currently I'm playing oot :) If you are worried about the graphics and frame drops, don't. Whole the game runs at around 900p, it has an amazing art style that makes up for it. The frame drops are very rare, only happen in very open bright areas. This game is enough of a reason to buy a switch. Will this game be game of the year? It's very possible, however there are many great game coming like red Dead 2, horizon zero dawn, destiny 2, and maybe super Mario Odyssey. That being said, it will no doubt be highly considered for it, and I personally think it will be the goty. I loved this game so much, and I'm very happy to see more of it coming through dlc. This game should definitely be on your list of games to play in 2017. Thanks for reading :)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Mick93,30-03-2017,"I have put a little over 80 hours into the game already, and I still haven't beat it, nor do I want to and maybe I just can't. Not because I'm not able to, but because every time I set my mind to do something specific, I end up doing 10 different things before I accomplish what I first wanted to, and have a blast while doing so.

Just an example. Yesterday my objective was to reach this one shrine that I had marked in my map. Things started getting cold, so I decided it was time for me to buy some sweaters, but as I'm always buying arrows and insects, I'm poor af so I went to make me some rupees in a mountain with a Goron that is my brother from another mother, as he likes to point out. This took me about an hour or so because I like this mini game and I ended up making more than I needed, so I decided to finally buy a piece of armor that is way too expensive, but I've always wanted since I saw it. Went to the place, bought the things, and went to another place to have it enhanced. But I didn't had enough materials to enhance the armor, and of course, I had to go and look for the things that I needed.

After finding everything and enhancing it to the max, I had to test it. So i went after some strong enemies and just stood there, getting hit and feeling OP. And then, about 4 hours or so after, I remembered the shrine I wanted to go in the first place. This happens every time, and I enjoy every single moment.

The story in very good, is very well explained in detail. Secondary missions are also entertaining.
The different climates and ecosystems they carry throughout the game are a artwork. The physical laws of the game are very well done without leaving anything to chance.
The different tests of the temples are very entertaining, especially those that use HD vibration. Also the dungeons are really good.

ZaniceDG,21-06-2017,"I have very conflicting feelings about the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Let me start with the game play. First off the dealer ability system I really didn't like it I think durability can work in some games if you do it correctly and I don't think it was done well on this. The fact that every single weapon breaks overtime made me not care about finding new weapons. It's nice that there is such a wide variety of weapons this game but I just can't care about them because they all break. Another reason why this hurt the game is because it made me not want to fight enemies. I also want to point out how completely ridiculous it is that the master sword can break even temporarily. It also doesn't help that you have such a limited amount of weapons that you could carry at one time. Another thing is the combat. It wasn't terrible, it worked, but I really don't think it was that good. Most every fight with normal enemies boiled down to me just mashing the Y button. The only fun I had with the combat was with bosses and extremely tough enemies. And even then the AI for most enemies with so bad and they rarely put up a challenge. The exploration in this game is great and I loved it but I think many other games did it better. I loved exploring and seeing all the different parts of the world but there wasn't a lot to do in it that I thought was fun. There's a big beautiful world in this game but what is there to do in it. Fight monsters? Find korok seeds? Do side quests? Sure I could do all those things, but I honestly didn't have a lot of fun doing it. I'm not really a big fan of puzzles so finding the korok seeds and completing the shrines really didn't do a lot for me. I did find everything collectible and did complete every side quest but that's mostly because I'm a completionist and not because I enjoyed doing it. Really nothing about the gameplay is TERRIBLE. But I don't think anything about the gameplay is particularly great. The weather mechanic in this game however was absolutely horrible to me. I can't tell you how many times I groaned and annoyance every time it started raining. This game requires you to do a lot of climbing and I don't mind that. The fact that it rains almost every in-game day and makes it impossible to climb and that is incredibly obnoxious. The rain is probably one of the most hated things about this game for me. Whenever it rained I would literally have to put down my game and just wait for it to stop raining. And that is not fun. How the hell am I supposed to explore when the game is constantly putting impossible barriers in my way. Also, this game's dungeons sucked. Overall I would say that the gameplay was just disappointing. That's enough about the game play for now. For now I want to talk about the writing in the story because that's what really made me dislike the game. I know Zelda isn't about writing or story. That's not the point. It's all about the gameplay. It's 2017 and I expect better writing out of this game. First I'll talk about what I like. I think Princess Zelda and a few of the Champions had very interesting and likeable characters. There was also a few very interesting Side characters you see throughout your adventure. However there were a couple of things that really annoyed me and kept me from being immersed in the story. One of which is being Link. Link has traditionally never had a character, personality or a voice. This was fine back when Zelda was 8 Bits. But it's 2017. And the fact that link constantly stands there in the cutscenes with no emotions and no personality like a plank of wood completely takes me out of the story. I actually couldn't take a lot of the cutscenes and seriously because of how funny I thought it was that link just stood there with absolutely no emotion to everything he was seeing. I don't think there is any reason why link shouldn't have a voice and personality in these games. Zelda has a personality, why can't he? But now I want to move on to the thing that angered me more than anything else. More than the rain. More than the most confusing puzzles. And that would be Ganon. This game has the worst villain I have ever seen in anything ever. Has to be one of the lamest final boss fights I had ever seen. He had no motivation, explanation or character. He never says a word in the entire game. The game defines him as being just a big evil demon who wants to destroy the world because reasons. It's probably the most lazy writing I have ever seen in any game I've heard of. As the credits were rolling the only thing going through my mind were the words ""f*** you Nintendo"". I thought that because I know that Nintendo is better than this. They could have made a better game. A better story. I did have fun playing it but there are just too many inexcusable problems and I don't think it's worth playing a second time. I don't believe I can justify a score any higher than 6. I had to chop this review severely to fit it in 5000 characters.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
klust13,17-11-2017,"Zelda Breathe of the Wild can be a very fun game, and it has a lot of extremely good qualities about it, such as sound design, how you fight, and a pretty engaging and wide world to explore.

That said, I did not have much fun actually playing this game to advance because of annoying gaming mechanics that could have very easily been done differently or tweaked to acceptable levels. A couple examples of these mechanics are the hot or cold zones, especially early on in the game where if you're in a cold or hot environment for too long, you take damage. This has been done well before in previous Zelda iterations like Ocarina of Time where these zones are limited to small areas you can hop into and out of in the early game fully knowing where the start and end of the zone is. You're stuck having to stuff your face with a potion you farm the ingredients for and wonder if the 5 minutes of safety is enough to accomplish what you want to in the zone.

That, however, isn't even close to the most annoying mechanic in this game. Imagine you found a truly awesome looking weapon. You can see yourself mowing down hoards of enemies with your new found blade. Ten swings later, it shatters into dust. This happens for virtually every weapon in the game. Don't even bother attempting to get attached to a weapon because it's going to break after a few enemies anyway.

Great idea, poor execution on the basics.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BirdSquanchy,20-04-2018,"One year after playing it I can say I've never feel the same with others games. The word is masterpiece and top10 games of the history. Play it, enjoy it and you will understand why everyone loves this game (ignore some minor haters)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
PandaMaster360,21-04-2018,"Forget all of the 3D or 2D Zelda experiences you've had. This game is nothing like any other Zelda game in our existence. Breath of the Wild has a perfect setup for an open world game. Instead of eight dungeons, it had four Divine Beasts and 120 shrines (unless you have the DLC). The Divine Beasts are focused on combat and puzzles while most shrines are more focused on puzzles with few being completely devoted to combat.
The starting area, the Great Plateau, is the perfect tutorial. The four Shrines give you the first runes and teach you how to use them. If you are exploring, you'll find secrets that'll help you in your adventure.
After the Great Plateau, there are barely any barriers. You can go beat the game right now (with enough skill) or take the long path and beat the four Divine Beasts and 120 Shrines. Quests are scattered throughout the land. While there are Main Quests, they aren't required. The Shrine Quests are done to unlock certain Shrines and are often based on puzzles. The Side Quests can be based on either puzzles, combat, or just a simple task.
The music of the game compliments the atmosphere in the game. In places that should have music, you can hear music that perfectly fits the area. Epic areas such as the enemy infested Hyrule Castle have epic music that builds up the final battle of the game, Calamity Ganon Vs. Link.
The combat in the game is handled perfectly. With ZL you can target enemies like Ocarina of Time. If you take the time to learn tricks, you can do things like Flurry Rushes and Perfect Guards.
The story of the game is absolutely perfect. I won't spoil it. I'll just say that the story is there, but not heavily pushed down on you.
So my final rating for The Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild is a 10/10. There are hardly any problems with the game itself. The only problems are with how I play.
So I hope this review helped you and pushed you toward purchasing Breath of the Wild.
If you can, buy the DLC. It adds a lot of great content. But without the DLC, the game is still great.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Vondett,04-09-2020,"... I wanted to play this game so much when it first came out . Got my hands on Switch and the first game I bought was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild . . . and I am disappointed . . . In so many aspects .

The game tells you from the very start that you are a special warrior of legends and then immediately treats you like a courier boy with endless fetch quests and go here deal with this small pack of goblins ... The NPCs CONSTANTLY reminding you that you were asleep for 100 years and that they have been waiting for you this whole time , doing what exactly ???!!! just sitting waiting ... I started to become really frustrated with the story in the third zone already .
They tell you that there are four great heroes who pilot the great beasts to defeat the great evil etc etc . So what were those people doing FOR ONE HUNDRED YEARS ! just waiting for some small skinny boy , because he was just a bit better than you average soldier . . . seriously . . .
Then the game tells you a story that the hero (Link) and the aspect of a goddess (Zelda) are being reborn over and over for over 10,000 years now . . . which didn't make sense to me , why put Link in a resurrection chamber and wait 100 years , when you could have let him die , he would have become reborn and learn all the skills in 15-20 years tops . No Link wakes up with no memory , no skills, no weapons , totally naked and alone and the game imposes all this responsibility on you and again tells you how awesome you are , and goes ahead to send you on a crap-ton of meaningless side quests which in reality in that setting of the world most of these quests could have been done by the NPCs themselves , but I guess they are too lazy, no wonder their world is so F-ed...
The whole thing from the very start feels like a grind for meaningless achievements.You constantly feel agitated and unfulfilled after every play session , I just hate it .

Some effects and physics are a nice touch , but at times too forced . The game MAKES you use its physics mechanics to beat certain story missions , it creates an illusion of choice and creativity which you do not really have in the matter .

Breakable weapons....... I mean . . . are you f***ing kidding me ?! You get some awesome sci-fi looking ancient sword , dont get attached , because it IS going to break after 2-3 enemies . . . wtf, that is a very bad game mechanic . You get one unbreakable sword , the master sword , but it is a LONG way down the line . Should have added an upgrade system to your weapons , and forge mechanic, kind of like Dark Souls has . You would find any weapon you like and stick to it and upgrade it if you like , if not just pick another , but the game FORCES you to always switch and look for weapons , any weapon in some cases even if its just crappy spear or a stick . . . just no.

The horse mechanic - you cannot spawn the horse from anywhere like in almost every modern game. Its just stupid . It adds even more unnecessary running around to the game that is mostly barren already .
Horse controls are horrible , one of the worst ever .

It seems like there is a focus to the game , but when you actually play there is none, in a bad way .
The game tells you that your character is special , but then it constantly reminds you that he is nothing more than an errand boy chasing a star which he is never going to reach...",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

To be honest after I got the master sword, I lost all interest in this game. I simply pressed on just to get through it and where is the fun in that?

TibbCrafter,12-03-2017,"How do I start? This game's title, ""Breath of the Wild"" details the exact thing in which it takes away: your breath. There is no title that is better at telling you what this game will be about. From the start, the game is just serene. The opening is just black, and there is no music. It just says: ""The Legend of Zelda"". The feeling Nintendo gives you is that this game will be calm. And that's true, except that there has to be tension. That tension is obviously Ganon. From the very start, you can see Hyrule Castle, enshrouded in this darkness. Everything else is so beautiful. It almost makes you want to beat Ganon immediately (which you could do, but you'd definitely have a hard time) so this darkness can be removed from your beautiful world.

The characters/NPCs are one of the most drawing elements to this game. They interact with you —and I'm not talking about Bethesda's kind of interaction where they say a line of dialogue and walk away— I am saying they will actually comment about the things you're wearing, or they'll give you advice, or they'll beg you not to jump off a bridge if they see you're about to leap. They just make the world feel so alive.

The world, it is massive, but not overwhelming.You soon realize that you are allowed to take your time. There's no pressure. If you just want to spend hundreds of hours exploring every part of the map, do so. The game is the truest open-world I have ever played.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ScavengerDragon,12-03-2017,"Solid 10. Now how can I say it's deserving of a 10? I picked up a Nintendo Switch at launch, along with Breath Of The Wild, and Super Bomberman R. Zelda has been keeping my attention more so than other games to come out in recent years.

If I had to reason why this game gets such a high score...It would have to be because it's a vast open world. It's a post apocalyptic Zelda that needs to be respected by the individual player. This does not mean you have to praise it as a solid game. This means that each user should take their own time to enjoy the game and explore the landscape as they see fit. Some might beat this game in a few hours, while players like me will take the time to savor the many different experiences this game offers from the 120 trials that are scattered throughout Hyrule, to completing the multitude of side quests that are offered by AI.

Every weapon is crucial. You can use a variety of them and get attached to them so easily but some break faster, while others will last you a few more bouts. but that's okay! Because it's never difficult to find a new weapon when you need them. I love the different assortment of weapons that I've found in my quest so far.

Overall this is a game that demands respect. Not absolute love because I say so, but because it's something the developers breathed life into. It took them a few years to get it to us but that's OK. Because what we were left with, is something that is a memorable experience that challenges what we understood about Zelda, and turns it into so much more, and the game sets Nintendo up with a large gap in the time line where they can make future Zelda titles without worrying about the timeline issue.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Love the mechanics of climbing walls and cliffs, and on that note, finally a REAL jump feature! I could not imagine this game going anywhere but up! (no pun intended)
Also, keep your Wolf Link amiibo close, if you don't have one, it would be wise to get one. Because you can use this amiibo to get Wolf Link as an in-game companion. Extremely useful! And of course not necessary, but still a good thing to have. Also, horse taming, swimming, and gliding, all very fun. Just don't let your energy drain all the way. Of course, where is the fun without challenges. You need to complete shrines in order to improve your stats, like health or energy. That's about all you can do with that, but the challenges are all different. Some are puzzles, some platforming, and other tasks that require some sort of intelligence.

SoulJustice,16-03-2017,"The game is amazing. Simple as that, it brings me back to it over and over and there are not many games that can do this. It is vastly unfair to give out a 0 out of 10. More people need to just play the game to completion to even understand what it has on offer for them. If you are not sure if you will like it by now, don't buy it.

WiSuBi,18-03-2017,"This game is AWESOME!! In fact, I don't really think the 7.5 it has now is reasonable. It should 100% be... 100%
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for Nintendo Switch, is an AMAZING game. It has an awesome open world, with many NPC's, monsters, BOSSES!!, and other things to interact with. This game is compatible with EVERY Amiibo, giving you in-game bonuses. Some Amiibo, such as the Guardian Amiibo, give you more specific (and better) items. You can really go ANYWHERE you can see (as long as it's in the boundaries of the map.) Some of these places contain field bosses, such as Lynels, and Stone Taluses. There is also an abundance of shrines, and towns. The shrines are REALLY great. Each one has it's own theme, such as ""A Minor Test of Strength,"" and ""Pushing Power,"" with a puzzle based around that. There is so much more to say, but I'm lazy, and don't want to write more.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

As a gamer that has played every Zelda game, the same happens witch every launch: every new Zelda entry surpasses and improves basically every aspect of the game play and overall enjoyability.

somebody123,27-06-2018,"The trailers will have you believe that this is a the ultimate Zelda game, but through my experience, this is one of the loneliest Zelda games I've ever played. Unlike in Ocarina of Time where I could almost remember every Zelda NPC, I could only ever remember a few characters from this Zelda game. The games music is also a huge disappointment in my opinion because for the most part, there is no music. Unlike previous games that have the iconic Zelda theme while you travel, this games traveling music is either the wind or slow piano music. This is just my opinion but I have huge mixed feelings about this game, especially since I love Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past. But I can't help but feel like this game is lacking the charm and personality that I grown to love in Zelda games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ImNuclearImWild,06-03-2017,"This review will focus on flaws.

Dungeons and Shrines:

There are only four dungeons, each can be completed in 20 minutes, but it will probably take a bit longer while you try to figure things out. For me, they took me 35 minutes each. Compare to past Zelda games, where the Great Deku Tree, a tutorial dungeon, is the same length. The Dungeons have no unique design, they all use the same textures, much like the Shrines do. Nor do the Dungeons have unique enemies, they only contain three enemy types: Mini guardians, infinitely spawning Bubbles (floating skulls), and an immobile dark eye that you need to find and destroy to stop the bubbles. There are no mini bosses like in past Zelda games, and all of the dungeon bosses have a similar design. As for the dungeons themselves, they consist of a few rooms haphazardly stuck together, and dont at all feel like a dungeon in the traditional Zelda sense. All dungeons have the same gimmick, movement of the dungeon to activate five nodes to unlock the boss. Three out of four dungeons focus on rotating the dungeon to access these nodes, a fourth is less complex and focuses on moving one part of the dungeon. At the start of the game you receive four tools that you will be using to solve the various Shrine puzzles. Having only four ways to solve puzzles, you come to understand how to solve most shrines after doing a few, most use very similar puzzles. There are a few exceptions to this, but they are an exception not the norm.

Enemies:
.
There are only 15 enemy types, this includes mini-bosses on the overworld, all others are recolors with more health. In terms of the AI, there is not much difference between the recolored enemies, they feature maybe, in some cases one extra move. Of those fifteen, 80% of the enemies you are going to be fighting are Bokoblins, Lizalfos, and Moblins. Another 10 percent are Keese and Chu Chu that die in one hit and the occasional Wizrobe. The other 10 percent are the other enemy types. Some of the enemies are damage sponges, particularly the highest tier recolors and Lynels, which have more HP than Guardians. It is very disappointing climbing to the peak of an incredibly tall snowy mountain, only to find nothing but a few Lizalfos again. Poor enemy variety discourages exploration and makes combat get old, fast.

Combat:

Unlike in other Zelda games, there are no directional input attacks, just one standard combo for each weapon type. There are about five or six weapon types: sword, spear, axe, two handed sword, boomerang, maybe one or two more I'm forgetting. There are no unique weapon movesets, weapons of each type are just reskins of one another. There's no incentive to fight enemies after you have decent or good weapons, you break your weapons for worse weapons. Because it is so easy to avoid or run away from enemies, and because the poor enemy variety means fighting enemies isn't that fun after a while, this becomes a problem quickly. A lot of the content of the game was supposed to be finding and fighting enemies, without them the world becomes more barren. Any difficulty the game could have had is removed by a heal system that can instantly heal all of your HP from the pause menu. You find a fairy fountain early on in the game, and one area south of the starting area is full of items that when cooked, restore all of your HP + give extra hearts.

Quests, Story, Music:

Half of the side quests in the game are fetch quests. One in particular asks you for a total of 100 pieces of wood. This requires you to use 200 bombs, one to knock the tree down, the other to turn it into wood, or the decimation of all your weapons. The story is told through optional flashbacks, there is very little going on plotwise in the world you are in. Because of the lack of a sense of plot progression, there is very little incentive narrative wise to keep you playing. In my opinion the ending was lackluster, especially compared to past Zeldas, The cutscenes feature not so great English voices (particularly the females), with no option to change voice language and keep English text, or to disable voices entirely. The voices in my opinion, remove almost all emotional impact in most scenes. The music is almost entirely absent most of the game, showing up only in towns, during certain cutscenes, or as fleeting ambient background noise. When it is present, in my opinion it's worse than the other Zelda's. Listen to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_TzYGd9pjk for an example.

Main Criticism:

There is nothing in the world but Shrines, enemy camps, small towns, and Korok seeds to pointlessly expand your inventory. There is a lot of empty space and ""dead air"" with nothing present or happening. After you have played the game a while, like most open world games, it gets boring, you will quit unsatisfied. This is opposed to finishing the game with a strong and satisfying final boss and ending, like Wind Waker.

It's a 6/10 for me.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
standres,06-03-2017,"It's a good game, but not a 10 game. Lots of things to do, but story is fairly weak, graphics really bad for these times even if it's on a handheld console or not. Games shouldn't be rated because of the nostalgia like most people did.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bmac6502,09-03-2017,"Fantastic. Retains all the story elements and style that make Zelda, Zelda. But it also brings in a whole different set of gameplay mechanics. I love the way that they throw you straight in with no hand holding. The amount of hand holding in more recent Zelda games (or even most other series) was brutally painful, but to do away with it almost entirely is both a shocking and brilliant move. But the real star here is the world. It is unbelievably interactive and at every turn it is designed to reward players who take their own path, think creatively, and take bold (but not stupid) risks. Incredibly addictive. I'm going to probably play this game 3 or 4 times.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Allama699,13-03-2017,"Firstly I would like to say, I have been playing video games for over 35 years, and have played most of the Zelda games to completion. I have been an early adopter of most of the gaming systems, and feel that I have a very broad experience and knowledge across all gaming genres.
I have played Zelda for 10 hours(ish), hoping for something innovative. Nothing noteworthy has happened. I have also watched a number of walkthroughs to see if I may have been missing something fundamental. I don't seem to have.
5-6 out of 10 max.
Boring unsatisfactory combat.
Derivative gameplay, that's been seen so many times before.
Inventory management simulator.
Upgrade path for Link is not worth completing the repetitive shrines.
Climbing towers to get another rusty sword, that you have to clear out inventory for, first.
Critics who gave this game a 9 or 10 should probably seek new career paths. Emperor's new clothes springs to mind.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
cake-jake,13-03-2017,"Amazing game which can be conquered in any order you wish, truly open world and continues Nintendo's trajectory of taking risks and innovation, while other companies just repeat the same style of games. While I am a fan of other companies, so this isn't an attack on other forms of gaming. It's so refreshing to play an innovative and fun game which focuses on user enjoyment over things like graphics.
Ultimately you play games for fun and this Zelda title certainly delivers.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kiddy2345,31-03-2017,"This review Have minor spoiler but noting to grave.
This game for me is great in term in gameplay and graphic are beautiful but the dungeon I find it as a excuse to waste time and it wasn't challenging for me. Everybody said the story was great but for me was pretty bland which is the weakest aspect of the game. The story didn't hook me at all but I am not saying it's the worst story of all time but still I can't denied how bland the story is. it using the same formula used to the previous games where Link have to save the princess and the day Just that this time he died and was revived to save the day once again while Zelda this time is fighting to contain Gannon many years. It's just the generic warrior saving a princess and there is nothing new to the story rather this time having voice acting and the voice acting was okay. But for me the most disappointing aspect of this game was the last boss battle that was beaten so easily just point your arrow in the circle area and attack and that it. This game felt as more for exploration and adventure which I enjoy and the soundtrack was good but not the best I heard in gaming as much people said. For most people this game may be the best of all time but for me it isn't.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I've played Zelda since I was about 5 years old, it was my second ever game after Banjo Kazooie and have loved most of the games but I advise you to stay clear of this game unless you want to feel like your beloved game series has been sh*t all over. Skyward Sword was a step down, but with BOTW Zelda is getting worse fairly quickly, is this the beginning of the end for the once great Legend Of Zelda series?",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
aerossignol,28-10-2018,"If I could fun up this game in a single sentence it would be... The developers spent their whole time making a beautifully crafted world with classic 3D Zelda combat but forgot to make the actual game. The problem with this game is, in short, that it's missing everything that makes the classic zelda games good. Dungeons? There are none. There are 4 ""divine beasts"" that are dungeon like, however are so short they're beaten within 15m each or less. Epic boss fights? Again there are none. The bosses of the 4 dungeons and Gannon at the end are so stupid simple. Mash attack and win. Progression of tools to help you explore? Nope. No hook shot, no boomerang (there is one as a swd replacement you can throw but it's lackluster). Pretty much all your progression is just given to you at the start. You get 4 unlocks , once each for the divine beasts but they're minimal. ..... So... What DOES this game have? A bunch of armor sets that you upgrade through a boring gring fest. A giant world to explore. A bunch of boring sidequests. A tonne of ""shrines"" which are essentially ""pieces of hearts"" or stamina (running, climbing) but the shrines are 2-5m anicdotes which tease you. A giant, beautiful world to explore. I can't say how disappointed I am with this game. I wanted to love it sooooo much, but there is no challenge, no significant puzzels, no bosses, no emotional investment in the characters. It's such a let down because there is sooooo much potential here , but , as I already said, they focused so hard making this amazing world and making the game mechanics work, they forgot to make dungeons and bosses.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Latimoor,13-03-2017,"I was a hardcore Zelda fanboy and played almost every zelda game until now. I just finished Breath of the wild, its an amazing game, but i am missing so many key features that makes a game feel like a zelda game.

Following is a list of what i am missing (and i wonder why noone have mentioned it before):
-) Only one boss: Each zelda had a variety of different bosses, this game only has one that was used 5 times (wiht minor changes)
-) no heart pieces: Okay, you can say that there are the spirit orbs, but looking for heart containers was so much more, you could get them at mini games, buy them, find them hidden in dungeons and so on...
This takes a lot of the motivation of collecting them.
-) There are only 4 ""dungeons"": And these are mere shadows of real zelda dungeons, they easily beatable in an hour, where as you had to spend several hours (for the first time) in other zelda game dungeons.
-) no unique items to collect: At the start of the game you are blessed with some functions of your sheikah slate and thats it.

If this game would not be titled ""Zelda"" ( i myself call it ""Elder Scrolls - Hyrule"" xD) i might could understand the hype about that game, but even then i would not rate it 10/10, for the following reasons:
-) weapons break way too often: just why? for some bosses i used up my whole arsenal of melee weapons to beat him, thats ridiculous...
-) puzzles get pretty fast repetitive: There are only 4 abilities that are usable, so after using them a couple of times each puzzles can be solved pretty fast.

I am absolutely clueless how this game got so hyped. Yes, indeed, the world itself is great and beatiful, but it should not be called Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

keyofnight,13-03-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a work of art—it has an understated beauty that is missing from many high-budget games. There is so much to appreciate in this game: the simple piano score that doesn't play in moments of reflection, the way Link moves through the grass (and the grass gives way), the impermanence of most equipment, the way the ruinated architecture in this game tells the story of Hyrule as you explore it, the way you discover new ways to die around every corner, the way they use empty space to give you the impression that Hyrule is a real place (a stark departure from previous Zelda games), the slow and thoughtful pacing of the narrative… it's all captivating.

The geeky, min-maxing, gamers out there will go on and on about frame rates, textures, and ""recycled characters."" (I guess every Zelda / Mario game is guilty of this lattermost complaint, and I wonder why people still play Tetris.) For them, a game is only as good as its (technical) performance, artificial novelty, and edginess (—notice how Link doesn't do backflips and parkour every time he swings a sword). That's fine. These kinds of people have been complaining about Zelda for a very long time, and most of them want to play a game to (re)affirm their adulthood. I, however, would much rather play a well-crafted game than a benchmarking suite that moonlights as a game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
GMR,12-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild isn't just a breath of fresh air for this 30 year old series but a masterpiece in open world design.

Within minutes of starting up the game you are thrown into a vast and sprawling world full of dense forests, tall snowy peaks, sandy deserts and much more. Breath of the wild gives you all your necessary ability’s right from the start so you can do anything you desire. Having most of your main ability’s available right from the start does take away from the progression aspect of Zelda but with an open game like Breath of the Wild it is understandable.

The game is filled with things to do from completing side quests, playing mini games or (my favourite) completing shrines there's a lot of content here to pull you away from the main story/quest. Shrines are a clever mini dungeon that can vary from a test of strength to a puzzle these shrines are a great way of rewarding players who like to explore.

The games story has been more fleshed out than ever with a griping story (which is completely optional if you so wish) and full blown animated cut scenes with voice acting. The story makes the world feel more alive and helps you feel like you are on a grand adventure.

The main quest is also great with 4 main dungeons that have you manipulate them yourself rather then have you solving puzzles. I really don't have much more to say on the main quest as it something that needs to played to fully understand.

The game runs well on the Wii U and on the Switch. However, I did notice the game frame rate drops when going into areas with lots of trees. However, this is only a small annoyance.

Breath of the Wild is one of the most creative games I've ever played. It realise on you thinking outside the box and using your head. I have never felt so immersed in a game since Ocarina of Time on the N64. It is a game everyone needs to play!

Don't trust 0/10 reviews, a huge majority of them are simply sony/microsoft fanboys downvoting the game because they are immature and write up illegitimate reviews to make you avoid buying this game.

Let me get this across : This game is GREAT. but it is not PERFECT.

If you want to buy this game on the Wii U, be wary as frames drop much more than on the switch version. The graphics aren't amazing, but the way the game is shaded like Wind Waker will make this game age very well.

I'd recommend playing it on the Switch (I have not played it on the switch yet, only on the Wii U) as I heard that frame drops happen much much less commonly on that system.

This is a must buy, but I won't give it a 10 for the simple reason that the frame drops are pretty bad on the wii u version. Besides this, this game is an absolute masterpiece. I can't wait to see what nintendo comes up with for the next zelda game.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

PlayorNaygames,07-03-2017,"I very, very rarely consider a game a 10, but Zelda is the best open world game since modern open world games became prevalent with the release of GTA 3. This is coming from a guy that doesn't usually like many Zelda games. Breath of the Wild still feels like Zelda in some ways, but forget most of what you knew about Zelda.

Many of the things that were annoying or clunky were removed from Zelda to make the game more fun (like needing bottles to hold things, now you can just catch and put into your inventory or you can catch fish just by swimming up to them and grabbing them, no need for a fishing pole, ect.).

The combat is fluid and Dark Souls like (but not hard like DS). The crafting system takes what makes it fun in other games, but still give you useful items if you make a dud. Yes weapons break quickly, but you find new ones all the time and you have other creative ways to slay enemies using your powers or the environment. The are lots of different enemies to fight with different behavior and attacks depending on their element or the weapon they hold.

The real joy in Zelda is the exploration. Never before has an open-world game felt so intriguing. There's always something interesting right around the corner to discover. This isn't your run of the mill, same repeated crap over and over. I'm continually surprised how often I find or do something that was unexpected and that's what makes the exploration so much fun. The game is great at providing rewards that make you actually want to explore the world, unlike most other open world games.

The art style is gorgeous even if some of the textures are low resolution. The frame rate can get choppy at times. These things are very minor and don't detract from the experience. The music is a great mix of old and new and is very appropriate and pleasing to listen too. The sound effects are fine and the classics are all there. There is little voice acting (only in cutscenes) and NPCs talk where they make weird noises before they speak like in other Zelda games.

The story is more fleshed out than other Zelda games. No it's not a Bioware game, but should you explore the main story you'll get a lot of lore and exposition from the many NPCs. I don't want to spoil anything, but it's much better than prior Zelda games.

The game can be harder than a normal Zelda game at first because the game has a lot of new ""rules"", but once you get used to it, the game is joy to play. The dungeons are broken up into small shrines, which is an excellent change. The shrine challenges are fun puzzles which are usually moderate difficulty, there were none that I couldn't figure out after trying for a while.

This game is like Ocarina of Time for N64, a revolution in its time that I expect many games to try and mimic in design going forward. Other open world games simply can't compare because they aren't nearly this much fun to explore. I recommend Breath of the Wild to anyone, all ages and genders.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

BoneyBob,05-04-2017,"I've played Breath of the Wild on the Switch religiously since the launch two weeks ago, and it was breathtaking. Changing the Zelda formula lets in a breath of fresh air, while still feeling like a Zelda game. It's going back to the roots of the original Zelda game on the NES, giving a true feeling of discovery and adventure, with a open world like never seen before. Nintendo has left no stone unturned when creating this world, just like I picked up every rock to discover what was underneath it. There is so much to discover and the world never felt empty, but instead alive with a sense of danger and curiosity what might be around the next turn. The level design is simply brilliant, making excellent use of the physics and weather systems that impact the game play in an interesting way, allowing you to play around and use it to your ability. This must be the best implementation of physics in a video game since Half-Life 2, if not better. The game simply is a masterpiece, and my favorite Zelda game. Maybe even my favorite game ever, if I don't count games with nostalgic value. Yes, there are a few technical hiccups, but it didn't influence my overall experience with the game and was not really an issue. Frame drops are only noticeable in a few places on the map, and these places didn't have (much) enemies. Freezes only occurred about three times during my play trough of 100+ hours and where therefore also pretty insignificant game play wise. Frame rate has been improved with recent patches.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

From helping a farmer meet his dream girl. To helping a solder catch a criminal. There is a abundance of content to keep you busy. The game also has you (spoiler) discover Princess Zelda's lost camera. You visit the locations of the images in the photo gallery in order to recollect a memory of what happened. It's a very unique approach to the Zelda story.

On the bad side of things, Nintendo changed so much the Zelda formula in this reboot that maybe some die-hard fans will not take it too well, luckily it is not my case and I could enjoy it VERY much.

Dont let the trolls confuse you, this is a true masterpiece, the game of the generation so far, Nintendo are magicians delivering this with a WiiU, this is a punch on the table in the world of teraflops, they showed that power without control is useless and that with affection, effort, good taste and attention for detail you can

seane2017,14-03-2017,"A Flawed Masterpiece

Breath of The wild is a great game with some glaring issues that keep it from truly becoming the 10/10 masterpiece it deserves to be.

But first, game reviewers, REPEAT AFTER ME.

Content Does Not Equal Quality.

The open world, is frankly, way too open. The obvious counter-argument to this is horses can make you travel faster, but too many parts of the world are unnavigatible for that to be actually true. The greatest asset of this game, It's exploration, is hampered when you see something in the distance and you just want to GO there. But you can't by horse, and you have to slog along with Link's unbearable running distance.

Another HUGE problem with the open world, is the you can't remember it all. This may not seem like a problem at first, this becomes a huge problem later on, in a big story important fetch quest. but this leads into another problem,

The Tunnel Vision.

If you didn't know already, Breath of the Wild has a floating marker on your mini map witch guides you in the direction you need to go. In a game that has hints about where to go next and a world that's obviously meant to be explored without a marker telling you where to go, this is a huge problem. Removing the marker would be a HUGE BENEFIT to this game overall.

One thing that really would help are a notes system for when you get tips from NPC's that don't get files under sidequests.

But for one little chunk of that game, the space of time between beating all the dungeons, and looking for [spoilers!] to [spoilers!], and without a marker telling you where to go, the game comes SO CLOSE to be coming the ""secrets around every corner and putting the pieces together yourself"" Zelda 1 sequel you never knew you wanted.

Good things
- Dungeons
- Shrines
- Combat
- Did I mention how good the combat was?
- Also dungeons. Again.

td;lr: Make world smaller, Remover marker, bada bing bada boom 10/10.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Tecno101,14-03-2017,"I have just finished the game, it is simple and correct, you have a lot to do, but that does not stop you progressing and you resume the main line of the game, if people do not appreciate this game is unfortunately because they are accustomed to super graphics and violence that has Taken the industry.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheParrradox,15-03-2017,"I was a little worried at first when I learned they were changing the traditional Zelda formula. But by the time the ending credits rolled I was completely blown away. The attention to detail and the absolute brilliant design ensures that this goes down not only as one of the best Zelda titles but as one of the best games ever made. Kudos to Nintendo in being able to retain so much of Zelda's charm in a game so vastly different from before. Similar to what they did with Ocarina of Time when the series made it's jump from 2D to 3D.

The game is revolutionary. I suppose the game was designed with only one thing in mind ""freedom"". You are free to explore in any direction of the map. Free to tackle the dungeons/temples in any order and most importantly you are free to engage enemies in any way you like. There are just so many creative ways I have fought enemies and I am sure there are hundreds of other ways that I couldn't think up of.

The game introduced us to voice work and it was amazing for the most part. I was not pleased with Zelda's voice actor however. Zelda did not sound like the way I imagined her to and it was a little unpleasant. However, my main grip with the game is not this. It's the frame rate.

I struggled with frame rate a lot. The drops were noticeable throughout the game and it bothered my gameplay. Oddly enough, frame rate was quite stable during the most important encounters. But I really hope Nintendo takes out another patch for the game to improve the frame rate and make this masterpiece of a game even a better experience.

Ocarina of Time is still my favourite The Legend of Zelda game but this game comes awfully close to beating it. As much as I enjoyed BoTW, I do hope Nintendo gives us the occasional traditional Zelda game because as much as I enjoyed this Zelda, I have a craving for the traditional Zelda game which it did not meet. I suppose this will be the reason why many Zelda fans are not going to be happy with BoTW and score it lower.

But even you guys have to admit, BoTW is a marvel. Every single shrine, side quests, main quest, or korok seed you collect is a fun activity. This game made me realize what modern games are missing nowadays. It's 'fun'. Just because we are doing something in a game doesn't make it automatically fun. Zelda addresses that problem and every single thing you spend your time doing in this game is an absolute blast. This is why I feel this game is revolutionary. This is a wake up call for game developers who are constantly making huge open world games and just filling it with boring content without considering the most important factor: Every activity in a game serves to entertain, and they shouldn't feel like a chore.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I was calling it before, and still hold on to my first statement that this game is truly the GGOAT­. 50 hrs in, still finding interactions with the world/objects/enemies that leaves me in awe and speechless, add to that the well crafted world, clever puzzles and collectibles and all the small variances in gameplay you can get in 1 single game and youve got the best gaming experience on the market right now. This game is for true gamers, not the type of sc-u-bs who will bring down a game for its resolution or graphics (pathetic truly) but for those who actually grew up playing good ol' video games for the amazing gameplay.

Overall the weapon system, meh. The horse riding is always fun, not expecting much. Story wise, very underwhelming. Dungeons look the same, only difference is the puzzles. DLC is a waste of money, don't even bother.

rsid,01-04-2017,"I am a fan of Zelda games, but in my opinion, Breath of the Wild (BotW) is not the best Zelda game, and as a Zelda game it has to stack against its siblings in the franchise. As a stand alone game, I think it is a great open world game, but it is not as good as the other games in the series. That being said, my gripes with the game are:

1) Tiny dungeons: Majora's Mask (MM) had only 4 dungeons as well, but they were huge in comparison (even to other Zelda games), full of creative puzzles, and quite hard for a first timer. In this regard, BotW dungeons were a complete let down. This is a main sore spot for series fans.

2) Quiet ambiance music that cannot compare to the classic overworld epic themes of games like A Link to the Pass, Ocarina of Time (OoT), Wind Waker (WW), etc. with a few exceptions on old theme remakes such as the Rito village (I admit that Gannon's castle theme was pretty good, but it doesn't redeem the rest of the huge world having so poor music). I understand that open worlds should not have intrusive music, but WW had a pretty open sea and the Great Sea epic theme was amazing and fueled a sense of adventure and exploration hard to match, so, this is a bland excuse for the lack of memorable themes in BotW.

3) Breaking weapons: I was already a little upset that my shields kept breaking in Skyward Sword (until I got the hang of it and eventually went for the Hylian shield), and then this game makes everything breakable. Even the Master Sword gets spent and has to recharge before it can be used again. I prefer the progression method where either your weapon gets stronger by some leveling means, or you collect stronger weapons throughout your journey until you find the ultimate weapon(s). But I don't like the idea of breaking equipment.

4) Low enemy variety: Basically, Bokoblins, Moblins and Lizalfos made the bulk of the enemies found in the game (with different colors to signal difficulty). I found it boring and even started to avoid their camps at some points because I was bored with them.

I am fine with Link being given all his tools at the start of the game, and I also enjoyed having to obtain them somehow like renting in ALBW. I always found moronic that the item needed to beat a dungeon was kept inside of it. But I would prefer some variant where players have to work for it, such as having to find important items somewhere first, like a mini-dungeon before being able to beat a dungeon with them (read iron boots in OoT). I like the feeling of accomplishment when I find an epic item such as the double claw shoots or the lens of truth or the mirror shield from previous entries in the series.

Oh, and I would have loved indicators of how many shrines and Koroks were left to find in each area, a la OoT Golden Skulltulas or Poes in Twilight Princess HD, but that's just me.

Everything else in the game is great and makes it a great open world title full of exploring (except maybe fixing cooking to make it less tedious and have a recipe book).

I believe that if Nintendo had put these ideas in the game, this would have been a perfect Zelda. But, as it is, this game didn't manage to climb into my top 5 favorite Zelda games.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Astorgh,08-03-2017,"I will be the first to admit that Aonuma and his team were pretty lost in the direction of where the Zelda series should go. Wind Waker was the first game where they 100% did what they wanted to do, buy due to back lash on the art style they decided to take a more serious graphical style with Twilight Princess, this being a game only made because of the criticisms that Wind Waker received.
Skyward Sword was another attempt at doing something entirely of their own, but they ended up doing the most linear and gameplay frustrating game of the series.
All of those missteps lead up to this gem of a game. Breath of the Wild is finally taking serious notes and learning from other games, including western games like The Witcher and Shadow of Mordor.
This game treats you like every game should treat the player, like a person capable of doing things of their own.
Taking all the Zelda elements aside, this is really open world perfection. Any enemy can represent a threat at any point of the game. Anything that happens, whether is a success of a failure, you have no one else to blame but yourself. All the enemies, all the scenarios are designed to overtake them in many ways. By 25 minutes into the game, you may have already 10 different ways of killing a Moblin. When you fight a boss, there's so many combinations of fighting it and not just one weakness.
The story elements may be a little overused, but it is done in the best way possible. All the characters react different to different situations. There's lots of side quests to do. It's just a grand enjoyable time.
The music in this game is just... I don't think there's words to describe it. The transition that music takes from one place to another just fits so well. The audio design is incredible. Just amazing. You can hear the Moblins that are close to you, as you approach a Fox and hear it walking through the grass, while hearing the wind blowing, etc. I could go on and on.
This is just a masterpiece of a game. Best Zelda ever. Probably best game of the decade.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
danirosa,31-05-2017,"Best game I have ever played. 37 y.o. have owned all kind of systems and games (Game Boy, SNES, Mega Drive, XBOX (Original, 360 and One), PS3 and PS4...) and I have never played anything like this!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kasparius,26-03-2017,"I wanted to wait until I had not only finished the game, but done everything the game threw at me before writing a reviews. Sometimes initial enchantment for a game fades as you realize the limitation of a game.

Yesterday, after completing my final 120th shrine, collecting all the memories and about 450 Korok seeds, I went to defeat the bloated, furious, orange swine to save Hyrule. Once that was done, there was a feeling of elation and subsequently, emptiness and sadness. I had finished one of the absolute best games I will ever play, and I would never get that initial feeling again.

I have been playing games for about 28 years, I've played a lot of them, and I can say that I've only extremely rarely had the feelings I had playing Breath of the Willd, and the most staggering thing isn't the fact that I got those feelings playing the game, it's how many times throughout the journey, I had them. Feelings buried deep within me that were probably beaten and driven to hide within the confides of my being somewhere around Junior High School. Feelings of awe and wunderlust, feelings of childish playfulness and wonder. The sheer desire to go see what's on the other side of the hill, the glory of the journey and the delight in what was to be found.

You can find other reviews that will better describe what makes this game so wonderful, but I have to say that I think the less you know about the game, the better. The joy is in the journey, and the discoveries you make along the way. This might seem like a cop out, but trust me it is not.

Is the game flawless? No, there are some minor issues and aspects that could have been even better (hopefully, those will come with the next iteration of the series), many of those can actually be fixed and patched, and probably will. But do those minor flaws take away from the whole? Absolutely not. I don't know of any flawless game, to be honest, even among my absolute favorites.

I've played hundreds of hours of this game, and thankfully I still have 400 Koroks to find hidden within the world, but even if I didn't, and there was nothing left on my checklist to do, I would still pick up this game regularly just to take a stroll along the hills and see what it has in store for me.

If you want to know what my absolute favorite games of all times are, to see if you might enjoy Breath of the Wild, here is a short list:

Witcher 3
Ocarina of Time
Wind Waker
Dark Souls
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night
Pikmin 3
Bloodborne
Red Dead Redemption
Super Mario Galaxy 2
Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate
Metroid Prime
Resident Evil 4
Mario Kart 8
Chrono Trigger
Silent Hill (the first one)

And many more.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Jusagi,16-04-2017,"Whilst i haven't had a chance to complete the game the game was nothing short of breath taking. Being a fan of the series i had noticed that whilst 'The Legend of Zelda' games kept the promise of a fantastic story line and game play, it began lacking something special.
As someone that held Zelda at high regard as it helped me become an aspiring games artist i look closely into the elements that make it special such as its immersive music, the feel of being Link himself and mind working puzzles, it gives me ideas which i can base some of my projects on. Breath of The Wild however held something more special. Like it's predecessors link remained mute with text and sounds of course leaving the player to decide. However this time, all other characters had a voice, adding much more immersive play element to this game. The environment and music also followed giving you subtle rising sound tracks that blends in with the immersive play and breath taking environments, reminding me of why i fell in love with this great title series.
I find it even more interesting that i can learn new things i didn't actually know you could do in the game before with people who also play the game! the game has definitely brought me hours of fun (though still incomplete).
I can not give it a solid 10 however as the game feels incomplete and rushed. Despite this however, it is very much deserves a 10 because even though feeling incomplete, has so much content that an average person would feel it may have been over done.
I hope to play more games like this in the future, Fantasy game developers should take notes from this game, it truly is incredibly close to a masterpiece as Ocarina of time was.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Frankly I think that 4 is a -1, which is a lack of a PC launch, an outdated system launch, and underwhelming what should have been a perfect 10 simply because of the publisher's conservatisms.

Turbowashington,07-05-2017,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece. This is easily a candidate for one of the greatest games of all time. I never thought Ocarina of Time could actually be rivaled, but this game is doing just that. This game's world is massive, yet every bit of it is built with an unprecedented level of care and intention. The world is so beautifully crafted that you just have to stop and stare sometimes. This place is so believable, and it is so easy to get hopelessly immersed inside of it. Exploring never feels tedious or repetitive, and there's always something to do or discover. Also, this game contains one of the most incredible physics engines ever created. Things move around and react to stimuli so realistically and it is so fun to play around with. For example, wind dynamically moves around grass, and if you cut down a tree, it falls in the direction you hit it. The game also has a very dynamic and satisfying combat system, which is simple at face value, but has a lot of interesting and complex possibilities in practice. This game's soundtrack while exploring is largely quiet piano cues from time to time, and while its very subtle, its beautiful and captures the experience perfectly. Town themes are very relaxing and well suited to the location and combat makes use of dynamic music, which perfectly compliment the actions inside battles. Some standout tracks outside of those include the exciting and tense Guardian encounter theme, the catchy accordion melody of Kass's theme, and the game's phenomenal new main theme. Another thing is the visuals. While its not extremely realistic, it doesn't need to be nor is it supposed to be. It has a uniquely stylized look with a vibrant and rich color palette, topped off with stellar lighting and shadow engines. One of my favorite features in the game are the 100+ shrines, which are like mini-dungeons, scattered across the map. Finding them is a blast and inside are some of the most deviously clever puzzles in Zelda history. I don't want to give away anything, but the story, while not a huge focus this time around, is pretty darn good too. And lastly, this game just induces some of the most indescribable feelings I've felt playing a video game. Just walking through the massive landscapes as the sun is setting, and the wind blows through the grass, I just feel happy and at peace. I know that sounded really pretentious but that's the only way I know how to communicate that. At times, it almost feels like a disservice to call this a video game. Breath of the Wild is truly an experience. It has been so long since I've felt so strongly about any piece of media. This is something you really just need to play to believe, and I give it the highest of recommendations.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Spidor,21-08-2018,"Big in the worst kind of way, BotW is a fun but hollow experience that lacks the guiding hand of excellent Zelda area design, replaced instead with what feels like a procedurally generated wilderness. Shrines and ""dungeons"" are largely more tedious than fun, insane rate of equipment breakage which requires pointless and boring inventory management, and generally a total lack of worthwhile things to do makes this a Zelda game with as many missteps as any truly great or ambitious ideas. It's quite easy to recommend as a Switch experience, but overall - it's not a very good Zelda experience, and that truly sucks.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
awholenother,31-03-2017,"this game has a scary hold on me. if you are a hater, i hope you will read this as something informative. it is absolutely a mistake to pass on this game due to some notion that you are on the other team -- don't be dumb.

so, last night i had read about a better way to manage my food inventory. for the first time in 2 weeks, i wasn't really feeling like playing, but i went in with just the idea of collecting some fruit and roasting it.

and then it started.

i warped to one of two areas on the map i had not revealed the map to, where i had previously failed to find some important location of the game. i got a horse from the stable and rode it. eventually i found the orange glow of a shrine and followed it. as i got close, i saw that shrine was right next to another stable. a guy at the stable invited me to try to break his record time in a horse obstacle course. i tried that about ten times and gave up.

there was a girl at the stable, and she gave me the information i had been looking for -- she pointed me to that important location i had failed to find before. so let me try to convey to you a common feeling throughout this game: there i was, and the obvious thing to do was to just get in the shrine, but somehow something even more awesome had been thrown at me. i was torn, and decided to go to the important location. unexpectedly, there was a guardian along the way, so suddently i had to run with this laser pointed at me.

whew, arrived at the location. there they told me i'd get something cool if i could bring the blue light from a hill all the way to the furnace outside. as i said, i still didn't have the map to the region, so i couldn't just look up the hill. i climbed the location, and sure enough from up there i could see the tower for the region. time to glide to it. along the way there was a third stable, and someone gave me a quest that it turns out i had already done, so that got checked off the list. got one of my three horses from the stable and rode the rest of the way. arrived close to the tower. some powerful enemies around, so i was careful. but, since i had beaten one of the divine beasts, i had a power-up that makes climbing so fast that enemies can't even aim their lasers. so, at last, map unlocked.

so now i knew where the hill was. rode to it, found the blue light. now here is how messed up this quest is. you need to carry the lit torch to the important location. but anything you do will extinguish the flame -- running, gliding, riding the horse, drawing the bow, drawing any melee weapon other than the torch, breaking the torch by beating monsters with it, and even accidentally walking somewhere a little too steep, because you automatically start climbing with your hands. so what you have to do is walk from one place to the other through a path littered with monsters.

but then i realized there were lamps along the way. you can light them with the blue light, then draw a sword, kill the monsters around you, then draw the torch, light it and move on. so not that impossible, but exhilarating. the last enemy in your path is that guardian from before, and you have to dodge the laser without running. phew, awesome. i made it.

so finally i go back to the first stable and solve that shrine. then i say, **** it, let's try to locate a memory by just looking at the picture. meaning i would recognize a landmark from a picture and try to find the exact point on the enormous map where one would have that exact view of that landmark. that was a very interesting process, and something i had never done before. i tried to line things up; i knew, by how much my view was off, that there should be a lake to the left with an island in the middle. looked at the map, and there it was. glided to it. landed on the island, where a ****ing rock formation woke up to reveal it was a rock monster. not in the mood for that **** so i swam fast and found the shiny place on the shore. was rewarded with a nice cut scene with overacting princess zelda.

so that was 7 hours after i just sat down to sort my food inventory. i never, ever do this with games. i'm 80 hours in and feel like i've done maybe 30% of the content i intend to do. 70 shrines and 80% of dungeons left to go.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

shadowloo,26-05-2018,"I really wanted to like BotW, but I just can't. I love the Zelda series and I've defended everyone of the main titles, including skyward sword, but I can't defend this. BotW is a generic sandbox game with a Zelda skin. Don't get me wrong, I love the art design and the world is gorgeous but it's empty and devoid of things to do. Beyond the main quest and shrines, there's nothing else. Gone are the fun minigames, sidequests to get hearthpieces or the beautifully designed thematic dungeons. Exploration is stinted by the horrible stamina systems, the inane weathersystem, the terrible weaponbreaking system and the halfassed combat system. I'm surprised no one has called it No Man's Zelda yet. I know that I'm pissing in the wind by hoping the next Zelda will go back to be more like traditional Zelda games, as Nintendo has already announced this is going to be the template going forward but I hope they at least fix a lot of these grievances (add proper dungeons, remove the weapon breaking and stamina system, add fun sidequests).",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Dedmosh,22-03-2017,"Ocarina of Time was my first game, Breath of The Wild does what should have been impossible, surpass it with flying colors.

I may not like weapon durability or the rain affecting climbing but the rest of the game is so outstanding that it merits a perfect score otherwise.

Frankly what is wrong with all you people?! A 7.7 User Score?!

You Philistines clearly do not appreciate quality gaming. I understand if you don't feel that this merits a perfect score, weapon durability almost lowered mine, but this is one of those EXCEEDINGLY rare cases where the professional critics have got it right and the user wrong.

I rarely give such a high score like this, and even more rarely do I criticize others over a game review but it is important to note that the people who have given this a low score are flat out wrong. There is no reason not to play this game if you can get it. This game trusts the player, if you would prefer to have Ubisoft hold your hand like a drooling idiot and explore yet another Ass Creed style Sandbox game fine. If you want a game that respects your intelligence as a gamer and doesn't force you through tons of obnoxious tutorials there's plenty of options for you out there.

Of course if you prefer those games to this one go play Horizon: Zero Dawn and every game made by Ubisoft in the last 10 years, unlock your filler sidequests by climbing towers and crow to everyone around you about how awesome it is to play as a chick instead of enjoying satisfying gameplay.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MeTheNinja,11-05-2017,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a fantastic game. That's literally all I have to say

Well maybe I'll say more...

The game starts off with an old man who gives information about the shrines and temples, and tells you to get all four shrines in the plateau. In those four shrines, you get special abilities such as magnesis, which helps you move metal objects with your shieka slate, or stasis, which freezes guardians, gears, and other enemies. The best part about this is that you can go to any of these shrines in any order you desire. After obtaining all 4 shrines, the old man tells you to go to the center of the shrines, which leads to a church. At the top of the church, you'll find the old man, who explains that he used too be king of Hyrule, and that Zedla has been keeping Calamity Ganon from reaching full power. He tells Link that he's the chosen one, tells you to go to find Impa in a village. From here on the choice in up to you. You can either go find Impa. Or go to Hyrule and die a bunch like I did. When you find Impa you screw this Im bored. You go find Impa, she tells you about the 4 divine beasts you kill em and the all like oh **** but the people who are ancestrs are like oh ye and you can like get miphas grace which won let you die or daruks protection which sounds like a condom to protect you from **** so after you kill em all you go to hyrule kill ganon but b4 u do that you have to get all 120 shrines and all the memories. Gameplay is great, you can choose from a variety of weapons like the Knight's Broadsword, Dragonbone Moblin Club, to a Savage Lynel Sword.

This game came in a time where the competition was incredibly high with titles like NieR Automata, Persona 5, Nioh, Yakuza 0, Resident Evil VII, Gravity Rush 2, Final Fantasy XV, and The Las Guardian, but Breath Of The Wild easily wiped them out. It single handling lifted Nintendo from the ashes after having a rough console generation, and impacted players for years to come with one of the most significant experiences anyone has ever had.

Мир: Окружение живое и красивое, каждая локация имеет свои черты, которыми она запоминается. Много святилищ, каждое из которых содержит уникальную головоломку, много секреток и просто интересных мест.

jwaynehall,07-03-2017,"This is my first review so give me some slack. First off the game is simply amazing. As soon as you start the game and walk out to that beautiful horizon you start to realize how much love was put in the design of this game. It definitely feels like a totally new experience but still has that Zelda charm. I love how the grass blows in the wind and moves as you run through it. I know this isn't any new or amazing feature but it just seems like Nintendo nailed that and many other things such as the ability to climb pretty much any surface. You really start out feeling like your weak and just trying to survive at first. The enemy AI is smart and will if you aren't prepared squash you like a bug. Early on you definitely have to plan your attacks and sometimes avoid them. You start out fighting with sticks and wood shields and graduate to rusted metal weapons then to High quality metal weapons. This progression makes sense as most of your weapons come from the enemies you kill. As you progress through the game the enemies get stronger, smarter and of course get much better weapons. Trust me when I say this your weapons will break and they will break a lot but there always seems to be an endless supply of weapons to find in boxes, treasure chest or off enemy combatant. There are so many other things I can go over in this game but at that point this starts becoming a strategy guide. This game is in no way perfect which is why I gave it a 9.0. So Let's get started with the cons which honestly aren't very many. There are times the game lags pretty bad but for me it usually happens within the first few minutes of playing. Keep in mind though this is when I played the game docked. I haven't noticed any lag when playing in handheld mode. The game looks amazing on that switch screen by the way. The grass and rock formations sometimes look very bland and washed out. Some areas of the game which look amazing just seem very empty. Load times can sometimes be a little long for my liking but maybe its just my impatience. There seems to be a very long loading time after The Wild Blood Moon cut scene. I am sure there are a few things i missed but to be honest I am too busy having a great time to notice. It's a shame that user reviews and scores for this game have been rendered useless due to morons giving the game 0's and 1's. By the way Horizon Zero Dawn is a great game also.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Loki-Chan,07-03-2017,"Breath of the wild is a fantastic game! There is lots to find and do in the world you'll discover, the new systems used in the game work super well and are super intuitive! The story is one of the best in the series I've seen in a long time, with lots of surprises. While breath of the wild is a fantastic game, there are also so many issues I have with it.

Breath of the wild has almost no enemy variety. It seems like you'll see all the enemies the game as to offer within the first few hours of play. I think I've killed 20 different versions of bokoblins by now. The game does change up the enemies themselves, like giving them ice or fire abilities. But it still doesn't do much. It's sad not seeing any of the classic Zelda enemies like, like likes, beamos, wizrobes, darknuts, and so much more. It seems like a missed considering the world is brimming full of life.

While I haven't had any bugs or glitches happen to me while playing, the framerate can be horrendous sometimes, it usually happens the most in Kakariko Village, and few other places. The game seems polished when it comes to performance, despite the previously mentioned framerate issues.

The soundtrack is amazing, places like Hyrule castle, and many cutscenes, have some of the best the series has seen in years, and it's even orchestrated! However, the game doesn't use much of the soundtrack anywhere else. It goes for more of an ambiance, rather than the upfront music the other games use.

The map is awesome! It has variety and sometimes make you use your head. Some areas you'll have to dress warm so you don't freeze to death, or find ways to stay warm. The opening hours of the game were probably the best when I started playing. The opening area is full of things to do and find, and most of the other areas do great at it as well! That being said, when you get to the game's bigger areas later on, it seems almost bland in some areas. While the environment is impressive to look at, it seems empty at times. You have areas that were amazingly detailed and filled to the brim with content, and then it seems like it gets progressively bigger with land, and smaller with content in some of the games bigger areas.

The weapons system is very fun and customizable! It was fun seeing Link use different weapons, rather than seeing the same swords from previous games. While it is super fun and makes you plan ahead in battles, there is also a lot of annoying problems that come with it. The problems aren't because of the weapons breaking themselves, but rather finding more after. If you have a good weapon and it breaks, it could take hours before you find another one that could be better or just as good, or sometimes even worse, but usable. This wouldn't be such a big problem if the game gave you more ways around it, but there aren't that many. Breath of the Wild doesn't have a crafting system, which is super annoying considering it would give materials found more purpose, rather than cooking or selling to traders. It almost seems weird that there wouldn't be a system to craft or repair weapons. While I found this to be one of the more annoying aspects of the game, it still works for what it is.

The voice acting is either really good, or horrendous at times. Now granted that will happen when you have a Japanese translated game, but it's super annoying that there isn't an option to use the original Japanese dialogue. But for a series first, it's passable.

The dungeons were some of the best I've ever seen in the series! It was weird interacting with them, in a way I've never seen done in any Zelda game before. I don't want to spoil there surprise, because they are so much more appealing and fun if you don't know anything about them. The game also throws mini dungeons called shrines into the mix. These are used to collect spirit orbs, which can be used for upgrades throughout the game. Breath of the wild excels on the puzzles in the game, but it was somewhat saddening to not see more main dungeons, and mini dungeons. Shrines do a lot for the game, but I also miss the days when I could find a cave in the game, and i could explore inside it to see what goodies it has. When doing shrines, you know the overall reward you are getting, with some minor treasures inside.

Breath of the wild is one of the best games I've played since Shadow of Mordor back in 2014. It was very well worth the wait, and has brought so many fun things to the table for the series. I can't wait to see the direction the series goes in the future! I hope to see these first time ideas expanded on, and even more added features. While the game is good, and Zelda is probably my favorite series ever, I will not be blinded by nostalgia when writing this review. The game is great no doubt about it, but it feels like something is missing from it. I do wish a little more could've come from the game, but for what we got it was amazing. I love the direction the series is going!",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ShockDome,07-03-2017,"About 50 hours into the game, and I can say that the game is what you make of it. It's easy to miss a lot of detail, and hidden mechanics in this game if you don't look close enough or have any patients. Traveling through the open world can be tedious if you haven figured out how to tame a horse or regularly use fast travel, and enemy variety is a little small for my liking. For the most part it is composed of mostly Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizafos of different color variations, and after a while you find yourself just running around enemies instead of fighting them, because you've already beaten 100 of the same enemy type by then.
Weapons are too fragile, while I understand a rusty sword breaking after a few hits, a Knights Great Sword should not break as easily as it does. Weapon movesets are actually pretty minimal, you have your Heavy weapon movset (Sledge Hammer, Great Swords, Axes) that all act the same way. Spears which even includes the Halberd, broad swords, and magic rods. Why would a Halberd be used the same way as a basic spear?
Aside from those minor complaints, the game is absolutely beautiful (this from a PC gamer) and unfortunately has random frame drops which does erk, but I mostly play in handheld mode which suffers from less to no frame drops. The characters are likable, quests aren't super repetitive, but at time the rewards can be lackluster. The voice acting in this game is both good and bad. Some characters have perfect fit voice acting, while other characters (Zelda) seem like they tried to hard giving their performance which made it sound forced an unnatural.
I would like to address some common complaints that have been going around and I noticed that most people who have complaints have only played a minimal amount of time.
-""The game is Empty"": It both is and isn't, and what I mean by that is that its very very easy to miss hidden secrets in this game if you arent paying attention. I am able to find something to do every minute or so. This might be collecting, cooking, fighting, making my way to an interesting spot, finding a Korok, hunting, taming a mount, doing a quest, solving a shrine, climbing a tower etc. However once you've found the korok or retrieved the enemy loot chest from areas over time the map gets more empty
- ""Many collectibles are useless"": Well if you do not find the proper NPC they sure are. Like i said it is easy to miss things, and if you don't find NPCs the items can seem useless to a person who hasn't progressed through the game or doesn't take time to make elixirs or meals, and just wants to bulldoze through the story.
- ""Link is slow and getting from one place to another is slow and boring"": Have you ever tried running anywhere? Of course its slow in the beginning and if you don't enjoy the things on the way it can be slow. However these individuals seem to have not played long enough to find a horse, or make use of the hundreds of teleport points on the map, not to mention the movement abilities you get further along in the game.
- ""Climbing is tedious"": Yes it is, and it limits your ability to explore certain parts of the map, until you get more stamina or movement abilities of course. if you have good stamina and climbing gear climbing takes no time.
- ""The game holds your hand to much and you can beat it in an hour and a half"": Umm good luck with that.

Most complaints seem to stem from simply not playing the game long enough or thoroughly enough, other complaints are just obviously troll complaints, and there are of course legitimate complaints.

The game is one the best I've played in recent history up there with Bloodborne, Horizen Zero Dawn, Overwatch, and TLOU. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes open world games and has the patience it takes to play similar games.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
THEPAGE,07-03-2017,"This game is amazing. The game is occasionally marred with the performed issues, however, putting those aside, the game is essentially flawless. Though the inventory screen can be cumbersome it does little to weigh down this experience. Honestly I find it hilarious that they're so many review here from people saying that the review are paid, and that the game sucks. Especially when they haven't played it.

Only real complaint is that the cartridge tastes bad.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DetroitSentai,07-03-2017,"The Highs:
+Nice Artstyle
+Good Music
+Shrines are cool and varied, never felt like they were really the same and used your abilities in new ways or combinations of each time
+Most Sidequests are pretty neat, lots of them that use the game mechanics in interesting ways and in the case of the shrine quests they tend to be area puzzles or riddles.
+Very fun toolset
+The sidepieces for entering most dungeons are really fantastic, engaging and use your toolset in unique ways(which I wish were more emphasized in each of the respective boss fights for each dungeon)
+One of the best open world map systems with customizable markers that you can have as many as you want for marking points of interest that the game doesn't do automatically

The Middles:
/The framerate may be a deal breaker for some, I thought it was serviceable for the most part but I can see it being a turnoff
/No real ""reward"" for game completion, you're just spit out to the main menu after watching the credits(or post-credits scene if you earned it). The only difference I've seen is all my saves after I cleared that game the first being an auto save just outside the boss room in case I wanted to repeat the fight) have a star next to them. Considering how the secret post-credits scene goes I'm kinda surprised that there isn't any form of NG+, Second Quest or post-game content.
/All of the characters save for Zelda and Link bear no strong ties to the plot, due to the open nature of approach. Kinda disappointed since there were a few characters that would've been nice to see show up for the ""climax""
/The voice acting is pretty okay, save for the one character who happens to have the most voiced dialogue seeming to lack any strong direction or emotion.

The Lows:
-The enemy variety is lacking, you'll see most of the enemy types in the first couple hours.
-None of the boss battles feel super unique or well built, they play mostly the same and don't lean hard enough into each of their slightly unique elements.
-The ending area feels very hollow, especially compared to the other dungeons of the game.

Overall Summary: ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" is a fresh take on the Zelda formula, incorporating exploration elements from the classic ""The Legend of Zelda"" with new modern game ideas often found in traditional open world games in addition to the iconic flair of the Zelda Universe. It succeeds in making an interesting world full of plenty of side characters, quests, and puzzles to keep you occupied but falls flat in most of the major story beats and set-pieces that are uninteresting and do not feel as unique as the rest of the games smaller segments. But with untold hours of gameplay and an interesting world to explore ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" makes a strong mark on both its franchises history despite some shortcomings throughout.

Yashvyas,08-03-2017,Its an amazing game no doubt there are some issues with framerate but that is only on the starting section of the game after that its running smoothly. The story is also very well developed and after beating just one duengon you feel like just going to the final boss and fight it out even though you know you are not ready that is how engaging the story is you dont even need to know the full story to get sucked into the game and all the negitive rewiews that say the story is not mature there are deaths of important characters that you shoulder in game and as for music its amazing the overworld has a very slow tune as you roam through it and the towns and villages have their own themes the best themes belong to the duengon and its bosses and there are also tons of other themes its zelda alright back to its origns and better to those who say it not a zelda game hence give it 0 and just being unreasonable. The gameplay is also engaging granted the inventory get maxed out quickly and it becomes hindarance when collecting weapons but it a minor flaw in the game whith many ways around it dont like small space expand it want to take a weapon but no space throw the one in your hand honestly that the whole point of limited space here you try out new stuff and see what works for you close combat just take swords and throw every thing else want to keep distance use spear or bows want to do more damage in less hits use axes or hammer i dont get why people fuss about it sure it get a bit annoying but all you need is use your brains and figure stuff out just because you dont get a weapon to just hack and slash without worying about durabilty you give the game a 0 based on that is stupid and lame even for internet it like saying horizon has no god of war style gameplay so 0 stop being salty and enjoy the game if you didnot play it dont rewiew how would you feel is people just gave a game 0 just because they feel like giving it 0 without evenplaying it or giving reasonable explaintion respect the developers of the game at least even if you dont like nintendo if you really want to complain try building your own game and see how it goes.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SpaceMichael5,08-03-2017,"The developers took a big risk with this game, but it payed off big time.

But they didn't just copy those games and call it a day. They put their own spin on the open-world adventure genre, while keeping Zelda traditions in all the right ways.

As it turn out is almost worthy of a perfect score, ALMOST. Almost everything in this game is faultless, the game play, the graphic design and sound design are all top class however the game is let down by a few little annoyances. First of all your weapon break in this game not a fan of it. Secondly the game is very proud of the fact that you get a horse but whats the point of having a horse when your going to be spending more of your time climbing mountains than anything else. I have a horse but other than the 30 seconds it took to tame him I haven't been back on him. Other than the horse ad weapon mechanics this is a very good game and i can see it being a lot of peoples game of the year winner.

GameMode,09-03-2017,"El juego toma ventaja de un muy bien hecho motor de físicas para cambiar la manera en la que interáctuamos con el mundo, dándonos una inmersión nunca antes vista en un juego de la franquicia. el juego hace uso de lo que aquí llamamos como ""Mecánicas de bajo nivel"" que consisten en que el juego funciona de una manera similar a la realidad, ¿quieres cocinar? agarra la comida y ponla en el caldero. pero para que funcione tienes que haberlo encendido. este tipo de mecánicas que se guían por la lógica y no por menús; hacen que el juego se sienta organico, natural.

La historia en este videojuego es una Magnum Opus, pues si bien está basada en la misma base característica, viene a romper muchas de las convenciones y a decirnos que tal vez queramos tomárnoslo con calma y andar un rato por el bosque.

Y es que andar por el bosque sin objetivo fijo es una gran parte de la experiencia, el juego te suelta en un mundo vivo y peligroso; pero a la vez gratificante. da gusto sobrevivir.

You hunt animals and cook with the meat you collect. Never expected a game like this to come out of Nintendo. It seems like they were heavily influenced by Western RPGs.

If you guys are hating on it for not being an Ocarina of Time clone, stop living in the past. This is a time for new ideas to be realized in video games, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild executes this masterfully. As for the Graphics and FPS, they are not bad to the point where they effect gameplay, and frankly, I am disappointed that people give a game 0/10 because the Switch doesn't match the computing power of Xbox and PS4. That is not what this game is about.

If you are looking for an amazing, rich, and vibrant open world adventure, this is the place to find it. Side quests are around every corner, and countless other things to do are everywhere.

You will see NPCs traveling on the roads throughout the world. If they get into battle, you can help them defeat enemies for a reward.

Definitely one of my top 3 of all time. Don't know if this tops Ocarina though. That game is the GOAT of video games. But it comes close. This game is based upon discovery. You discover new shrines, new towers, new stables, new villages. There is not quest path like in other RPGs. The music is sublime. Heavily influenced by Studio Ghibli. Very piano driven and subtle.

It's the first true Zelda game that you can find yourself getting lost in. The world is huge and full of things to do.

Everything else is beyond perfection, could ask for more in a Zelda game.
Generally not that keen on open world games but this is an exception.

Ryan1994,13-03-2017,"This is a brilliant game, in some places flawless, but the frame rate issues make this game at times unplayable, and the horse mechanics do my head in. For the whole 80 hours I've played this, I probably spent 30 minutes on a horse because it was too frustrating to use.

Also, coming off the main game for a second, I'm not a fan of what Nintendo is doing with the DLC, making you pay for a difficulty which is coming in the summer is an embarrassment, and the worst thing is is that people will pay for it because it's Nintendo.

But overall, the story is great, graphically it's beautiful and the hundreds of secrets, dungeons, shrines, korok seeds and the many hours of adventure I put in to this game is worth while. I really hope Nintendo continues to do this with the Zelda franchise is the future.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Josborne,14-03-2017,"The game is incredible. The open world is vast and filled with life everywhere you look, all the mechanics were clearly thought out and carefully balanced, you actually want to go see what's behind the mountain in front of you and that's a feeling I haven't felt in a really long time. I have to say, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild deserves a 99% if not more for it reinvents not only the Zelda series but the whole open world genre. My only gripes with the game are the dips in FPS I've noticed in TV mode and the micro dips in tablet mode. I'm extremely sensitive to these so to the average person the dips in tablet mode won't be noticeable and I haven't seen anyone complaining about this before.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

DatSchnizzle,16-03-2017,"Open your eyes.... these are the first words you hear when you first start the game. It was 2011. Nintendo showed us Gamers a tech demo of a new Zelda Game for the Wii U. 1 Year later they said they are working on a new Zelda Title but it will be a lot different to the first footage we seen of the tech demo. 2013 in a Nintendo Direct Eiji Aonuma said that the Zelda title will 100 percently come. But with a twist. It will complete start a new beginning in the Zelda era. It will be like the old Zelda games (a Link to the past) where you can completely explore the whole world on your own. But now with new features and a complete open world and the main thing was, it was 3D. The mission of the game was to rethink the conventions of Zelda. After that a year long we heard nothing. At E3 2014 Eiji Aonuma showed us a little cinematic that gave us a glimpse of the new Zelda game. At some time Zelda should come 2015. However we now know that, that wasn't the case. They showed us a gameplay of the game at the game awards 2014 and it was amazing. It was such a little glimpse but everyone was pumped for the game. Later on they said they will release the game 2016 what also wasn't the case because we saw a release list of the games of 2016 and Zelda was listed for 2017. E3 2016 we saw the first Trailer showing us the game and it was amazing... the feeling this trailer gave me is undescribeable. At an event of the E3 you could also play the game. Everyone said they loved what they have played. But there were framerate drops but that isn't the big case in this review. Now 2017 they showed us the new nintendo console in detail and they also made the announcement that the console and the game would release at the 3rd March 2017. Now the day has come.... 03.03.2017 was the date and it happened....the game was finally released. And it was unbelieveable to see how good it sold. Me as an Zelda fan of the first hour was going crazy because there was no Switch or Zelda available at my local stores. But then at the 7th i finally got it and since then i am playing Zelda.... Wake up Link. You get out of the first room in to the big wild. You can see everything in your view range... and the view range is REAAAALLLY BIG. The Art-Style is beautiful, the Graphics beautiful, the Character Design is beautiful, the variety of Weapons/Armors/Bows is unbelieveably big and the Story is as beautiful as it could ever be.

It is the absolute perfect return for a Zelda game. Nice story, with a great graphics, nice puzzles, and the fighting mechanics are very accurate to what a Zelda player must expect. The soundtrack fits perfectly within the game. The return of Gannon's activities are, probably, one of the best aspects of this new Zelda world. We also see a more human part of Zelda and Link's relationship, making it even more interesting to save Hyrule.

Also the RPG new aspect of game (armors, weapons, foods and consumables) adds a very nice experience to players, all scaled very correctly. After the prelude, you are just thrown into a vast free world, where you can seek, destroy camps, do side-quests or just stare-out to the brilliant nature that surounds the player.

I have to give props to Nintendo for deciding to outsource their console creation to a third party of IT students with 2 hours of experience, it really gave them a lot of hands-on experience with consolemaking 101.
Now about the game, it is about this protagonist called Zelda who carries around a legendary sword and crossdresses as a girl sometimes because of fanservice (many people were aroused by this) who is looking for this egyptian symbol he can put on his hand to grant him infinite power, much like Palpatine except he's not grey and wrinkly.

DelWolf,19-04-2017,"Before I am accused of only giving this game because I am a 'Nintendo fanboy', or because I'm a brainless fan of the series, I want to point out that I favour Nintendo no more than any other company that produces games, and this is strangely the first Zelda game I have ever played. So when I say that this is already one of my favourite games of all time, it really means something.

Firstly, I will acknowledge that the graphics are a mediocre 900p, not even utilising The Switch's ability to display 1080p. But the characters are actually well animated, and the world is definitely something to behold. There have been a few frame rate drops, however, since the big update, I have not noticed any more.
What I also noticed, and was pleasantly surprised by, the game doesn't hold your hand AT ALL. You literally step out of the spawn area, and boom, explore your heart out. And that brings me to my next point - the world is HUGE. I can't recommend this game enough if you are a fan of the open world genre. I will try to keep this review spoiler-free, but the story definitely throws away the whole 'damsel in distress' idea, which is cool. The beautiful soundtrack also only adds to my love for this game.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, un mundo vivo y salvaje

La historia de ‘The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’ da comienzo con Link despertando de un sueño de cien años. Desorientado y con la única ayuda de una voz que le guía en sus primeros pasos, el protagonista de esta historia empieza a ser consciente de que el mal reina en Hyrule y de que, tal y como ya intentó cien años atrás con la ayuda de la princesa Zelda y de otros cuatro elegidos, deberá acabar con él.

Este es el punto de partida de un Zelda que viene con ganas de romper esquemas. Un Zelda que seguirá gustando a los fans de la saga, pero que a buen seguro conseguirá levantar más de una ceja y de dos entre los más conservadores. Se podría decir que es el Zelda menos Zelda de todos, por muy extraño que pueda sonar.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
strider0905,03-04-2017,"This is the best game that I have ever played. PERIOD! I can't put it down. I'm over 80 hours in and only about half way through. Most players say about 60 hours to complete it, but I'm taking my time. Going through the areas, completing quests, shrines, getting every Korok seed I come across and picking up any resource in sight. I absolutely love this game. I won't even complain about the frame rate drops. It's not that much of an issue to me. My only complaint is how fast the weapons break. BUT, you do get weapons later in the game that last much longer. The game play is phenomenal! I love the graphics! And how much there is to do! Hell, it took me over a year to sink 80 hours into Skyrim, and I played Breath of the Wild for 80 hours plus in a month! I'll be playing this game for a while. I feel no need to buy any other games. I even skipped out on Horizon Zero Dawn(Which I'll get eventually). As for all the negative user reviews who have never even played the game. They just need to stop being petty and get over themselves. I am no Nintendo fan boy, by any means and I never even owned a Wii U.

BD82,06-04-2017,"Breath of the Wild is by no means a perfect game. Is it a great game? Yes. Is it my favorite Zelda I've ever played? Yes. However, it does have problems, and no, not weapon durability. No way to get around rain is really annoying, and there are slight framerate issues, although those were mostly fixed in the latest update. However, I wish the game felt more Zelda-ish. We get a boomerang (although I don't love it), and we get bombs, but we don't get a hookshot or any other typical Zelda items. The dungeons also are not great. Most of my complaints are very small, although they do add up. However, the game has so many great aspects. The fact that you can complete anything whenever you want is perfect, and weapon durability is what makes sure you can't run around with a Savage Lynel Crusher the entire game. The cutscenes are very well made, and the physics engine is one of my favorites. The fact that everything interacts with everything just makes it so much better. I would give Breath of the Wild a 9.5, but since that isn't allowed, I decided to give it a 9 because it's not a perfect game.

I use the key word almost as what the game lacks is character. Breath of the wild's open world is often empty and pedestrian, I almost felt the map could have been downsized by 40% at the very least.

The main quest objectives were fun and enjoyable, but I felt forced into doing the tedious side quests in order to gain some advantage at the end game. So like the map I reckon the playtime could have been cut down by about 50 hours also! At the end completing the game didn't feel like an accomplishment, as by the midway point i had already lost interest, but didn't want to add the game to the list of games I've played yet not completed.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

njasa10,25-04-2017,"With time, perhaps I'll look back on Breath of the Wild more fondly than now. It has some major pitfalls and really falls short in a lot of the areas that it is trying to mimic from Western games, namely voice acting, gameplay, lack of enemy diversity, and story (although it was good for a Zelda story but compared to many of the modern games it is similar too such as Far Cry or Horizon, it is much weaker). Unfortunately, the addition of voice acting is actually a detriment to the game and at times was borderline unacceptable. The gameplay was much less fluid than Far Cry or Horizon or even Assassin's Creed, a series which has been riddled with bugs and frustrating moments. By introducing these open world elements that have become a staple in modern western games, it forced comparisons to those games. However; if Nintendo would have made a more traditional Zelda game then perhaps it would have left me with a more positive impression of the game. As much as I tried to separate my expectations, to be honest, my opinion of the game was hurt by the overwhelmingly positive reviews it received from critics. I try not to let expectations affect me, but unfortunately that's a reality of gaming. The game isn't without it's merits though. The primary positives are the ability to go/climb anywhere and it's choice to not hold your hand (although even here, Dark Souls did it better). I appreciate both of these things immensely and my first few hours and last few hours of the game were very enjoyable. But somewhere around 30 hours in, I became fatigued and was ready to sprint to the finish. In the end I spent nearly 50 hours on my playthrough and had some wonderful moments in the open world and some unfortunately burdensome moments. Overall, it's an experienced that was very mixed for me, with very high highs and some extremely disappointing lows.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

jpacor,08-02-2018,"Honestly, one of the greatest games ever made, whether you are a Zelda fan or not you WILL enjoy this game. After Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, it was clear that the standard 3D Zelda formula was getting old, and I was nervous when hearing that BotW was going to be different and was afraid of what Nintendo would come up with.,.

But it was totally worth it! The open world is absolutely amazing, beautiful, jam packed with content, and MASSIVE. The physics of this game are incredible, allowing for you to climb just about anything and glide for long distances, allowing for a huge sense of exploration and almost no boundaries for where you can go. Having several shrines, instead of single long dungeons, was a great idea as well, challenging the player with puzzles without disrupting your exploration for too long a period of time. Combat is also more challenging, where your weapons break and you are forced to strategize and prioritize weapons based on the opponents that you fight. Much better than using the sword, hookshot and arrows a million times like in the old games.

My only complaint, and this if forced, is the boss battles, which aren't too exciting or complicated, but this isn't enough of an issue to say this game isn't perfect.

BotW is honestly a reason to buy a Switch, it is a perfect game, the best yet of the current generation of gaming, and is a really exciting direction for Nintendo. I hope that this is a good sign of things to come!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

For a full review, go to the Team MM YouTube channel and turn on notifications so you don't miss it.

If you haven't played this game yet, OPEN YOUR EYES. You have missed one of the best games to EVER come out, and that's saying something.

Now, another spoiler warning, if you don't want to have the game spoiled for you.

Review:

Open your eyes... Open your eyes. Wake up, Link.
You wake up after a 100 year sleep in the Shrine of Resurrection, where the main tutorial takes place. ""Oh No!"" you say to yourself. ""Another seven-hour long Zelda tutorial!"" Then you start playing. You learn most of the the basic mechanics in this shrine, such as climbing, wearing clothes, and using the ""Sheikah Slate,"" a plot tool/super cool item to use, all within... 1 minute? That's right, after this tutorial, you're out in the huge open world of the Great Plateau, the birthplace of the kingdom of Hyrule. 2 points for the short tutorial. After meeting an old man, you're free to explore the HUGE world of BotW... until you realise that the huge area you're in only accounts for about 2% of the world. The old man tells you to complete four shrines, the mini-dungeons of the game, so let's say you do it. You've just unlocked the four main mechanics of the game:

Cryonis, to freeze giants blocks of ice on top of water, making it possible to cross.

Stasis, allowing you to freeze almost anything in time, to put either kinetic energy into it or to stop it from ramming into you.

Magnesis, allowing you to move metallic objects out of the way.

Bombs. Just bombs. You have an unlimited supply of them! One point for unlimited bombs.

Now that you have completed the shrines, you can get back to the old man on the roof of the temple of time, who will do something so spoilery that even with a spoiler warning, I won't tell you. He gives you the paraglider, a tool that lets you escape the plateau, into the HUGE open world (2 points for minimal time spent in opening area) ... until you realise that you first need to go VERY far to Kakariko village, then even FARTHER to Hateno village, only to be told to go BACK to Kakariko village. After that, you are told to find a certain location (When you're nearby, you'll see a rainbow shine where it is). The easiest one to find is near the Great Plateau, which means you have to go all the way back there, and then go BACK TO KAKARIKO VILLAGE (YES, AGAIN)! Minus 6 points for boring stuff! Anyway, after that, you're playing a Nearly Flawless game. PROS (Plus 0.5 to 2 points for each): HUGE WORLD (2), hard fighting without the frustration (2) (somehow, Nintendo added difficulty absolutely PERFECTLY), good weapon levelling system (1) FUN GAMEPLAY (2), great graphics (1), and LOTS OF FUN PUZZLES (1). Cons: Weapons and shields break super fast (2), Too easy to defeat guardians as long of you have a shield (0.5). VERDICT: BotW was a very fun game. If you've been keeping track, you would know that the score is currently 9.5. 9.5 is rounded to 10, so, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Gets a 10 out of 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
martinileemart,12-05-2017,"Overview of Play Time:
I have played 70 hours, completed 75/120 Shrines, found 78/900 korok seeds, saved 3/4 divine beasts and unlocked the entire map. I still haven't beat the game but that's because I'm waiting until I get all the shrines unlocked.

Comparison to The Witcher 3:
The Witcher 3 was the best Open-World game prior to BOTW because of its size, graphics, combat and story. I beat the game and started a second play through and have enjoyed every second of it. The big difference between The Witcher 3 and BOTW is the dialogue options, of course, but also the importance of main quests in each game. When playing the Witcher 3 it gives you recommendation character levels to beat each mission and completing certain ones can prevent you from completing others. This is as linear as the game will get but this simple thing will only allow a certain amount of quests one can complete while completing the game. In BOTW there are no recommended levels to complete quests making this game a pure non linear experience allowing the most freedom from any game previous. Another big comparison between the two are the map sizes because both are similar in map size but the BOTW FEELS way more massive. This has to do with the ability to climb and shrines. The mountains in the BOTW are no joke and you can plan to spend 10-20 min. climbing the big ones When you reach the top is the moment you feel the vastness of the map, which you can't find in other games. Both games also include horses but in BOTW you never really want to ride the horse because the game is better running/climbing around every nook and cranny.

BOTW is for smart people ONLY:
This game is filled with shrines, which require puzzle solving and physics combined, Korok seeds require quick thinking for some but mostly involve puzzles, most of the side and shrine quests are riddles and rarely show where to go, divine beasts are massive puzzles, etc. This is where I think the majority of the negative feedback is coming from because most people find the game too hard and blame it on the breaking of weapons, blah, blah.. This where weapon prioritizing comes in and is an important skill to learn throughout the game.

The one negative thing:
When completing side quests, the reward is usually a large rupee. I didn't have a problem with this at first but after a while I wish there was more variety. There is one side quest in the desert town Gerudo that I wish more side quests were like, *Thunder Hel.... *cough* because of it taking multiple side quests to complete. Rupee's in BOTW come very easily because of the items found throughout exploration so having them as a reward is a small letdown.

Summary:
I still have a lot more to do before I call it quits with BOTW and it's going to be a while before that happens. I have had multiple moments throughout the game where I just look at the atmosphere and just let out a ""Wow!"". The game is uniquely gorgeous and tests your curiosity like no other game before it. Go out there, buy a Switch and buy this game because you are missing out on one of the best gaming experiences in your lifetime.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The only good part of the game is the exploration for the sake of exploration, some puzzles of the exploration are cool, and some are not. The 4 main-temple are short but well made and fun, show what the generic temples could be... the Master sword dlc is faaaaaar better than the entire game. I'm not trolling here, Nintendo gave an incomplete game and people were all ""wow, so different""... I was with really high hopes for the game being a zelda fan and the reviews, and got an meh experience... If you forget all about game and just go relax for the view and the sake of exploration you'll like this game, but the lack of variety of monsters and real rewards makes exploring nonrewarding, so its just exploration for the sake of exploration ... The game don't deserve the 1 note that I gave, it could be a 5 because the exploration for the sake of exploration, but I really feel strange knowing that this is a opinion of a minority and almost no one sees that way....

MiroirNoir,18-11-2020,"Is it kind of lame to play the contrarian and dunk on a beloved game? Yes it is.
But after putting in many, many hours into this game I feel like I have earned the
right to voice my complaints.

Now, I don't think I have to spend too much time on the positives, as they've already
been praised enough.
This beautiful fantasy world really does feel more alive than in pretty much any game I've played before and the things you can do within this world are very engaging. In other words: The game really has a ""feel"", if you will. It has its own style and just walking around, interacting with the game world is fascinating.

Exploration is rewarded (kinda) and there are tons of quests and secrets to be discovered. I'm just not sure if the rewards are worth the effort. More inventory space, a new weapon that will break after 10 hits or a health container - to me, that's not incredibly motivating. But maybe that's different for you.

But here's the thing. All of this is in service of a story that is completely forgettable. And I think the problem lies in the fact, that most of the really interesting things in the story have already happened by the point Link wakes up and the player takes control. You effectively run around in a desolate world shaped by fascinating events, but you only ever learn of them through reading stuff, listening to characters talk about them and watching flashback sequences.
The characters are all flat and there's no way to really form a bond with these cardboard cut outs.
The central conflict in the flashbacks revolves around Princess Zelda's feelings of self-doubt, which could've been interesting if you, the player, were actively involved in that drama or affected by it. But it all happened in the past and so you just watch a spoiled princess whine about how she doesn't feel ready to take responsibility. Now, maybe it's because I'm a guy and my parents aren't royalty, but I really have a hard time empathizing with that. Not great storytelling, to be honest.

My next big complaint is in regards to some of the game play mechanics. The game can make the simplest of tasks feel frustrating:

Oh, you're trying to climb this mountain while your stamina keeps steadily decreasing? How about some rain, that'll make you slip and fall to your death?

Oh, you could really use a horse to speed up travel right now? Well, tough sh*t - your horse needs to be within hearing distance - no really! - in order for it to come find you.

You found this really cool weapon? Let's see just how quickly it'll break. Will it take 10 or 15 before it breaks? Find out in the next really tough battle!

Now I, for one, don't think any of those mechanics are fun. I feel like they're wasting my time and they're frustrating. But I get it. The devs wanted to make this a realistic adventure experience.

But this is where the biggest flaw of the game comes into play: a contradiction at the heart of this game that it never manages to overcome.

So on the one hand, you have this living, breathing world and all those survival mechanics that make interacting with it feel meaningful. You can freeze to death if you don't wear warm (or magic) clothes, you have to tame horses before riding them and you have to cook food before it becomes really effective.

But on the other hand, this game is trying to keep true to its roots, and so you still have heart containers, dungeons and all the Zelda things that long-time fans have come to expect.
And since those elements all come from a time where games had technical limitations and game play took priority over immersion, they feel incredibly out of place in this fantasy world.

The game never lets you feel completely immersed. Every time you pick up a floating heart container, every time you enter one of the - oof! - 120 puzzle shrines and every time you think for a second about how weird it is that the economy of this world runs on gems, you are reminded that you're playing a game. Because in all three of those cases, the explanation for why they chose to do things that way is: because that's part of the brand.

And those two elements: ""Zelda"" the traditional franchise and ""Zelda BotW"" the modern game copying the latest trend of survival games never really mesh together and I am utterly convinced that a majority of people is blinded by their nostalgia to not see that.

This is a good game. Maybe even a great game. But it's so far from being a master piece that I cannot take anyone seriously, who declares it as such. Saying this is ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER is, simply put, lowering the bar. And I don't think that's a good thing because we should ask for more.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Botw_bestGame,17-05-2021,"This one of this games for which you wish to have amnesia to experience it all over again. I have put over 250h into it. Playing it twice with both DLCs (first and only one's I have bought so far).
I know it's not perfect. I know there are quite a bit of things I would think of could be a lot better but for me it still is.

So many things I love about this game.
The feeling of entering the stables at a rainy day talking to the NPCs for a side quest and checking Terry's stock . This beautiful Japanese styled village that's got this wonderful music. Don't even get me started on the beauty of Rito Village or Gerudo town...
Although the story is the same as always in a zelda game, it is uniquily interesting. I always found myself chasing the cutscenes to get to know more about Link, Zelda or the others.
The game has an interesting sense of progress since your not grinding your levels to increase the numbers on the screen. A welcome change.
Instead you gain new abilities, more stamina or hearts. You might wanna build your house or a even a town.
This game is the very definition of freedom in a videogame...
Have a really stupid and weird idea in mind to kill the monsters? Do it, it will work. Want to go to Goron city and to the story there first? Do it. Want to go some shield/snowboarding? Do it. Want to enjoy the view and music somewhere and chill? Yes. Or just straight to the main boss?

And the game looks cartoony and the characters don't even talk! They just make annoying chirping noises.

LetsBHonest,20-04-2022,Putting myself through all it's filler puzzles dungeons just to get enough hearts to survive and play was a pain. Sometimes the filler puzzle dungeon would have a hammer or item I'd loot from a chest in the dungeons that would be needed to fulfill the puzzle. Often I would not be able to complete the puzzle before the item broke. I saved in the dungeon halfway since I was struggling with the puzzle and when I went to reload I could not loot a new weapon to try again..

Senselessvirus,17-04-2017,"This game isn't great. If your playing it handheld and fight more than 2 enemies during any weather condition the framerate will die so hard the game completely freezes for 1-3 seconds every time you knock an enemy on it's back.
Speaking of enemies, there are barely any variety with the majority just being recolors. This game could have definitely benefited from creating heavy types that you had to knock armor off of with shock arrows or specific weapon types.
Tridents are completely pointless as weapons since they take 2 hands and can't knock away shields like greatswords. The biggest problem I had was THE MASTER SWORD IS WORTHLESS. It has terrible attack and is only useful against guardians and bosses and even when it powered up it's still not strong enough and can run out of energy while glowing.
The sacred beast dungeons aren't even dungeons, they qualify more as large shrines. Hyrule Castle is the only true dungeon with more than 3 enemies in it. Also like the enemies every boss and miniboss barring Ganon are reused, the sacred beast bosses are just the same type of phantom Ganon with slight remodeling. Calamity Ganon himself was hugely disappointing since having done all 4 ""dungeons"" he was easier than a standard guardian.
Finally the story or what little there is has very little of the standard Zelda points to it like Triforce anywhere. We also never find out why the Master Sword chose Link, He just got it because.

Overall this game is empty, overhyped and overall forgettable. I could easily see all mention of Zelda lore being removed and it being packaged as another game. I doubt I'll ever come back to it now that I beat it and assume it will be the same for a lot of other people who played it. Probably the only thing I'll remember about this game is Prince Sidon and the quest to get into Gerudo town.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
chrisjb1983,04-03-2017,"Monotonous fetch quests, empty open world, dated gameplay, archaic graphics (even while docked) struggles to give this game a purpose next to the greats of todays video game masterpieces. The story is great even though it lacks proper voice overs throughout most of the game. Controls can be atrocious at times in the midst of combat or while trying to perform one of the many puzzles in the game. Art style is appealing and many returning fans will be accustomed immediately.

Pacing was well presented, but the game lacks proper audio in several sections of the game. Zelda is a joy to play if you can look passed the several short comings.

BOWi,18-12-2017,"Is this a good game? I guess it is for fans of open world games. Is it a good Zelda game? I don't think so.

I discovered Zelda with Ocarina of Time and played every games on home consoles. I buy Nintendo consoles because of Zelda games. I bought a Switch because of Zelda and skipped the WiiU because of the lack of it.

I was very worried when I learned that BOTW would be an open world games because I I'm not a fan of such games. I liked GTAV and Red Dead Redemption single player campaigns, but I like them because of their story and because of the funny random/not-so-random encounters that made to game feel alive.

You won't find random encounters in BOTW, aside from wandering and tedious ninjas who tries to kill you. Other annoying things are: breakable weapons, lack of the traditional Link's tunic, collectibles-tied slot expansion system (tied to 400+ hidden collectibles), lack of traditional dungeons replaced by soul-less shrines (which are hidden), lack of proper story, empty world, etc.

Adrenalin,04-03-2017,"I love open world games. I love The Wind Waker and Ocarina of Time. I always had a special heart for Nintendo software, starting from my childhood.

Thing is, I planned on playing this game almost exclusively in handheld mode and when I did so yesterday, I noticed heavy aliasing, really heavy aliasing. I knew the screen was only 720p but I thought Nintendo would pack in some supersampling, but no, not at all. Because of that, it almost looks like a 3DS game in handheld mode, but with heavy flickering, something that personally distracts me heavily and can even lead to headaches.

So I had to return my Switch with BotW just a few hours after having bought them. It is a shame, I would have loved to explore this world, but I currently have no tv for the Switch and handheld mode is unplayable. I wholeheartedly can say: The Switch sucks and it damages BotW badly, very badly. They had one year for this port, so it isn't just so bad because it was ported. Very sad quite a lot of reviewers didn't talk harsher about these dramatic issues, they were probably bought or never played in handheld.

Alongside the hidden lack of anti-aliasing, there is the obvious low texture quality and frame drops. In the two hours I played this game I noticed one small freeze and definitely the low res textures. Render distance wasn't really an issue, but could be higher for more prettiness as well.

The result is that the game is most likely very good, but also heavily hold back by bad Nintendo hardware. Especially texture quality and antialiasing have to be higher for a perfect score, maybe even the render distance. Because of these issues, I give BotW a 5/10, with the possibility for a 10/10 once they release this game on decent hardware.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SubjectG,06-03-2017,"The game was good, yes, but lacked the plethora of interesting characters and deep personality that made me love The Witcher III so much, Gameplay was sort of bland, inventory management was a pain, and the world often just felt... empty to me. Sure, the art style is interesting to look at, but the Switch's technical shortcomings meant that we weren't given a lot of the environmental sound effects, lush greenery and scaling environments that have sorta become a must-have for open world games, nowadays.

The 'story' is interesting enough, and the puzzles and shrines are definitely creative and provide a healthy challenge, but I feel that Breath of the Wild is lacking in a lot of subjects.

Do I think the game is bad? Not in the slightest.

Is it perfect? Absolutely not.

I've had a lot of fun with it despite my gripes, and I think that I will continue to do so...

gegezerg,02-05-2017,"Once you start playing this game it looks beautiful and so open. The world is amazing with tons of things to do. Then around the 3-5 hour mark you realize that when you look deeper into the game that it's literally garbage. It's nothing but a Farcry/Darksouls mutation with a Zelda skin. After going through about 10 weapons in 10 minutes of gameplay you begin to wonder what where they thinking when they designed this?
The after going to the 100th shrine wondering where is my reward? Oh, was it the rusty shield or the broadsword in the chest? Wait, but, that's going to break in a few hits.. I noticed a pattern here.. I've been grinding shrines/towers, and breaking weapons and all this time.. I have nothing to show for it.. Every once in awhile you will get a piece of armor that gives some resistance or swim speed or something to that effect, but they don't really help much.
Oh and, don't bother trying to do the story from the start... get ready to grind shrines until you have a ton of spirit orbs to get more hearts and stamina or you will be having a heck of a time dying over and over again in the most frustrating ways.
Many of the features in the game are just terrible.
The breaking of weapons leaves you with the feeling of no rewards. No way to be attached to your gear and feel like you are progressing into a hero once again awoken from slumber.
The stop time ability is very frustrating to line up your shots and using it will break your weapons and I have wasted many on it, and if you think you can use a tree branch to launch a stone ball 100 yrs think again.
The controls seem clunky at times, having to quick switch weapons constantly during a fight or pause the game to eat, sometimes I wish they would have make a slot to put a healing item to just press it and heal instead of pausing, going to the food section then picking something the resuming. It just isn't very fluid and breaks combat. At times you will just die before you can get it paused and do the whole eating in the middle of a fight routine.
The towers remind me too much of FarCry.. the repetitive cutscenes and grinding just got boring after the 10th tower and 40th shrine..
Oh and did I mention the breaking of weapons? lol, They say you can parry a Guardians laser back at them and do damage.. what they don't tell you is it breaks your shield lol, so get ready to have a few shields broken fighting one.
Many people have said they just avoid combat altogether because of this mechanic. I myself began doing this. The game became even more boring after that, just running from shrine to shrine, tower to tower, to get orbs to get more health because I was unable to do the story without grinding for hours.. it's a beautiful world that surrounds the Calamity Ganon of a game.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

NeuroShock,07-03-2017,"I am going to try to be fair & objective.

The game was build so that you could go anywhere & complete most things in the order that you want but because of that Nintendo made sacrifices. Discovery is no longer about collecting items to help you puzzle solve & transverse the world… now the discovery is about places in the world & limited treasure. This is what really splits a lot of players here. Some LOVE the fact that they can explore the HUGE world while people like me feel that quantity does not compensate for the quality needed in storytelling, puzzles, non-disposable treasures of value, & meaningful connection to the characters in the world. Travelling the world has become tedious work, battles become too boring, treasures found become disposable objects that you will quickly forget about & the few puzzles presented are way too easy.

GAMEPLAY: 6/10
Battles enemies starts out interesting seem fun for about the first 16 hours of game play but they quickly become a tedious chore. There is a huge lack of enemies. To substitute for the lack of AI depth the tougher battles try to overwhelm you with high numbers of enemies OR bigger enemies. After you fight the same enemy types for a long period of time it just gets old really quickly & you learn that they really will not catch you if you run away anyway.

You basically get all the special equipment you need to traverse the land at the beginning of the game so you are not longer earning equipment & puzzle solving you way into new discovers. You will no longer feel like you earned items because they are all given to you towards the beginning of the game. Discovery is no longer about collecting items to help you puzzle solve & transverse the world… now it is about discovering what is in the world. As a result, the items tend to be disposable weapons, armor, & endless amount of food ingredients. This keeps with the theme of quantity over quality. You find a lot but most of what you find is disposable junk that limits your sense of accomplishment.

There are only Main 4 dungeons. I love how you are able to alter the environment in a creative way but when it comes down to it they are all too short & easy to beat. The game tried to compensate by having puzzled based dungeons in the form of overly simplified & too easy to beat Shrines.

Weapons in this game are all unique & fun to use but are ultimately terribly balanced in many ways. It is so fun to be able to use spears, swords, & clubs that all have a different feel but they quickly become repetitive. The worst part about the weapons is that they all seem to break way too easily (averaging about 1 break per a battling a horde of 5 enemies). Each weapon has its own damage output status which causes a lot of problems by making battles way to easy towards the end of the game. In fact, you can beat some bosses so quickly that you will become disappointed. I felt cheated out of having any sense of accomplishment out of what should have been considered an epic battle.
The stamina meter was horribly balanced & is poorly used which makes travelling a chore & less fun. The world is so big & the speed you move is so slow. Stamina is used for running, climbing, gliding & fighting. Running depletes the meter too quickly Climbing stamina depletion, in terms of distance/stamina bar is balanced, however the game speed at which Link climbs is too SLOW it becomes the worst part of the game. Gliding was well-balanced & a real treat.

STORY 1/10
It seems like every Zelda has the same basic never changing premise where you have to stop some main enemy/evil who has kidnapped “guess who” for ambiguous poorly explained reasons.

The voice acting in this game is decent to good but is not utilized to its fullest potential. The game alternates between voice acting & reading dialogue of characters. I want to note that it is 2017, this is a triple A title, there is no excuse for why this game is not completely voice acted.

The characters you run into & meet visually stunning but ultimately lack depth needed to be memorable. I appreciate that Link is still a blank slate for the player to psychologically project their own being onto. All other characters lack any real depth needed to tell a great story & are quickly reduced to stereotypes & plot devices or tools to obtain items or fragments of what should be a plot. I demand a plot, realistic characters, & something thought-provoking. I would even be satisfied with something artistic & kiddy like Lego Batman as long as there was something deeper to what is presented.

kohto,03-03-2017,"The stellar reviews really do not accurately portray the game. While it is a good game at its core, it is missing a lot that previous Zelda games had, most notably a memorable soundtrack. Gone are the tunes that we'll forever remember from OOT and Majora's Mask, they have been replaced with completely forgettable ambiance. The game is also incredibly open ended with no sense of objective or urgency. Whether you do anything or nothing at all, the game's world seems indifferent to your presence. While this is on par with most open world games, it seems out of place in a Zelda game.

I would liken this to Skyrim with a Zelda skin, rather than an actual Zelda game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

EmiliaClarke202,18-05-2018,"So i recently bought a switch, and I am a Zelda fan. And after I've seen the critic reviews, I thought, it must be good then. I'm sure some zelda fans probably loves this reboot, but to me it just isn't that good. To me, they changed it for the worse. I mean, at least they try to innovate, but i guess they can't please everybody. I don't know if most of the red scores are trolls, or people who feel the same way as me. I really hoped I would love this new Zelda, but it is what it is. at least, I'm looking quite forward to Mario Tennis",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kuehnau,03-03-2017,"Well the day is finally here for the Nintendo Switch and Breath of the Wild. After all the fanfare and hype, was it worth the wait?

I'd like to start off by saying that all of the 0 out of 10 reviews don't seem fair. But I think that's sort of the price you pay for having such a well known brand and franchise, it brings out the worst in people. With that being said, those reviews aren't wrong, even if the scores appear to be.

Going into Breath of the Wild, based on just the online reviews and videos alone, I was expecting one of the most epic Legend of Zelda games to date, unfortunately that really isn't the case and previous entries in the game series end up faring better in comparasion.

I think one of the bigger issues stem from the fact that the developers lost sight of the core game when they started moving it into ""open world"" territory. The developers became more engrossed in that concept than what really makes a Zelda title a Zelda title to begin with.

When compared to other games in the franchise, the selection of enemies is shallow compared to what we usually come to expect from the series. Generally these games tend to have a wide selection of enenmies that change based on the dungeon and region of the game. With Breath of the Wild, we are seeing a lot less unique enemies and instead a lot of re-colored or re-skinned enemies as a direct result. This wouldn't be horrible if it was expected, like with titles such as Dragon Quest. But in a Legend of Zelda game, it's a bit of a disappointment.

The story isn't nearly as grand as it has been in the past. And while I haven't actually beat the game yet, I have found myself not nearly as invested or interested as I would have from previous titles in the series. A lot of times it feels as though the story element of the game was tacked on as an afterthought.

The game play is also equally shallow when compared to other games in the franchise. Yes, there's a lot of weapons you can collect, but considering their frequency of appearance and the fact many of them will break over time, they are really underwhelming. None of them feel nearly as powerful or epic as you'd expect from a Zelda title. Remember all the neat tools you'd get in other Zelda titles? Nonexistent. Don't expect to find cool tools such as the hook-shot, it doesn't exist. I think this is one of the things that hurts the game the most.

There are no heart pieces. Rupees are still in the game, but not in the same capacity as other Zelda titles. Instead you'll need to actually work to earn Rupees, you'll need to make and sell things in what appears to be an active economy and for whatever reason, it doesn't feel as if it fits properly with the overall theme of Legend of Zelda.

There's a severe lack of music in the game. It's still there, but it doesn't feel as grand as it did in previous entries of the game. I see what they were trying to go for with the music, but it doesn't feel the same.

As far as the technical specs go, the game looks good for what it is, there is no complaint there. But if people recall, there was some complaints about slow downs for the game, which apparently were reported to be fixed. But lo and behold people are still reporting slow downs on Breath of the Wild. This doesn't really surprise me as a release day title, but that doesn't make it any less disappointing. Folks are reporting that the switch can get pretty hot when played for extended peroids, so it makes me wonder if the game is suffering from the system physically slowing down due to the system becoming too warm, like how a tablet game will under perform on a Android tablet.

So, what's the final verdict? It's a Legend of Zelda title in name only, it doesn't feel like a proper Legend of Zelda game at it's core.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
NeonPurple,15-05-2018,"Jesus Christ, where to start. So I’m not a big fan of this game, which you probably can tell by my review. Zelda breath of the wild has some of the worst story I’ve ever seen. I did quite enjoy the old ones, but for some reason, it’s not the case with this one. And why is it always the same story over and over again Nintendo? Where’s the innovation. This game has a lot of issues, and I truly hope the next Zelda will surprise me in a better way. What I like about Nintendo is that they take their time with their exclusive. But they really took some poorly choices, how to make this game",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
IAmPaperworkDan,01-04-2017,"Let's get the good points out of the way. The game is visually stunning. Throw around ""900p"" and ""cartoony graphics"" all you like but artistically styled games always outshine realism, especially in the long run. Next is the open world. It's big... impressively big. So big that whenever I try to describe it I always fail to do it justice. This for me is easily the best thing about the game and should be held as the new standard for open world games in the future. However an open world experience is only as good as the content that brings the world to life, and in the case of Breath of the Wild we find that Hyrule is as good as empty. There's no fun in exploring if there's nothing to discover now is there?

Stumbling across and getting into scuffles with new enemies is fun for a while but ends abruptly when you realise the handful of early game encounters are copy and pasted throughout the entire world (albeit with a few recolourings to establish a power increase). Then there's the shrines. Gone are the staple Zelda dungeons and in exchange we are given 120 shrines, each containing a single puzzle. None of them take any longer than 5 minutes and using the word puzzle is giving them far too much credit. In fact, several don't even contain any puzzle because climbing the small hill to the entrance was ""challenge enough."" The most difficult shrine I encountered involved using motion controls along with an awful camera angle to solve a ball and maze puzzle, and even this could be cheesed by flipping your controller upside to get rid of the maze aspect. The challenge comes clunky controls rather than good game design. If it weren't for the eventual reward of either an extra Heart Container or Stamina Vessel then I wouldn't have even bothered to complete them. There are quite a few side quests to pick up along your journey but they are never anything more than errand boy tasks, most of which go completely unrewarded, so collecting 55 of a certain kind of mushroom or dispatching a group of enemies was nothing but a waste of time. It would've been nice to have some story arcs delivered across multiple side quests but with the exception of one quest in which you help a man to build a town, all side quests are completely independent of each other. Another tiny complaint would be with the performance issues. The game tries to run at 30fps but right from the get go sees regular dips to as low as 15fps. This starts out as very annoying but as the game goes on I found myself noticing it less frequently. Maybe the starting area is just a little more demanding or maybe I just got used to it as time went on.

I've not got a lot to say about the main quests. There are only 15 of them and most of them are dished out in your first few hours. Essentially your objective is simply to defeat Ganon. There are the four Divine Beasts that can be reclaimed along the way but there's nothing too exciting about any of them. They're not even a requirement and if anything make your inevitable final fight too easy. In order to gain access to them you need to complete your usual errand boy tasks for the local residents and participate in what is best described as a mini game. Once inside, each Divine Beast houses it's own gimmick to help you access a number of terminals allowing you to regain control and is then finished up with a very easy boss battle. It's certainly a way to kill time and gives a little insight into Link's past with the associated cut-scenes but they're nothing to get excited by.

What disappoints me most with Breath of the Wild is the wasted potential. I can't help but feel this amazing world could be put to much better use. The game doesn't feel like a Zelda game anymore. Why couldn't Nintendo have just given us a brand new IP? An open world of this standard would be far better suited to an RPG. It just feels like the Zelda name has been slapped on to secure some extra sales, severely limiting the games boundaries as a result.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
fallingtitan,05-03-2017,"The games story fails to draw you in and it starts off very slow. The fighting mechanic is amazingly simple yet can become deep. A+

however, the swords break after 1 or 2 enemies and is very annoying. The game struggles to give you a smooth experience. Game lags a bit on most fights with the wii U version. Most the game is spent climbing and traveling the huge amazing world. It is kinda boring. But the huge open world is truly a masterpiece.

But unlike the witcher 3, zelda does not make the huge world a joy to explore. It has a pointlessness to it that i've never seen before. The urgency is gone in this version of zelda due to the weak story.

If this game is any indicator of how good the series is, then wow I really need to play the older titles. I've played a great variety of RPGs. Loved the Witcher 3, Skyrim. Just played Horizon and loved that as well. And now Zelda. Can I just say how happy I am that at the level of quality we'e seeing from modern titles? This Zelda game is amazing in how you can explore and traverse the land. You're not restricted to roads. You can literally climb over mountains. Any place you can see on the map is accessible and that still blows my mind. Cooking provides a great way to prepare for the cold environments or hot environments. It's also the only way to regain hearts. In A Link Between Worlds, you actually picked up small Hearts. I'm assuming thats how past Zelda games were as well.

Boy was I wrong. I had no idea how expansive the map really is. It was a bit overwhelming at first but once you get used to the basic idea of discovering new Towers and Shrines, it becomes easier. Though those damn Guardians made it so difficult. My complaint about the game is the Yoga clan. I can't go into it more without revealing spoilers but they are annoying. Also the frame drops that occur on the Plateau and Forest regions can be pretty annoying in docked mode. Absolutely no drops in Handheld mode, which is what I primarily used.

CriticalAlpha,10-05-2020,"Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is a Mediocre disappointment. That somehow got the internet echo chamber thinking it's the best game ever when reality it's far from it. Infact, It's one of the most Soulless Open World games I've ever played in my life. And the reason why people even like this is because simply of brand recognition. I'll first be talking about the pros before I get all crazy with the Cons. And I'm a HUGE Zelda fan.

Pros:
-The Climbing mechanic is neat, Especially remembering in Skyrim where you'd end up walking up the mountains that you want to climb.

-I'm not against the Open World approach infact, I'm a huge fan of Open world games in general and also a fan of Zelda.

-I guess a good variety of armors is neat even though I really STRONGLY PREFER to see Link in his Iconic Green Tunic.

-I also guess the cooking system is pretty neat.

-I can appreciate the story being a little more hands off (In-spite of me liking Skyward Sword) I mean, It's quite refreshing to see Link being his own man again.

Cons:
-The enemy variety sucks! Like seriously, The enemies in the games can be boiled down to Moblins, Bokoblins, and Lizalfoes with the occasional Wizzrobes and Chu-Chus.

-The Weapon Degradation system sucks! Like seriously! Why are they all so frail? Why is the Master Sword and Hylian Shield no exception? Why arn't the amiibo weapons No exception either especially with the RNG bullcrap going on?

-The Shrines, They're all the same, They look the same, with some small meaningless puzzles that arn't fun. Even the ""Divine beasts"" are just samey with the samey bosses.

-When it rains, It makes climbing WAY too hard. Sure there are workarounds but Some walls are too tall to scale during the rain and it forces you to wait till it stops. I also don't like how you are forced to swap weapons when it rains.

-I don't like Kass or Sidon, I mean, How people gush over these characters makes me cringe, Their proportions look weird and I'm not about Sidon's narcissism and Kass' Annoying accordion Music.

-I also don't like how Zelda is portrayed in this game, I mean she's extremely whiny and **** (And I don't like the hairstyle they chose for her, Makes her forehead look weird.)

-Why is the Green tunic so hard to get!? Especially considering the RNG crap you have to go through with the amiibos and these amiibos are really hard to find in Real life too the point I had to get amiibo cards 3rd party sense Nintendo understocks them. And it's the ONLY way to get it earlier in the game. Heck why do we need amiibo to get a certain variant of the Green tunic I like? There's a green tunic that you can get without amiibo, BUT that would mean clearing most of the game's content.

If anything, It kinda feels very Microtransaction-y in a way. Ideally, If I had an amiibo, I'd get the Green tunic after I scanned it and I could earn the Green Tunic variants during the course of Gameplay.

-The Korok seeds are a pointless boring side objective.

I mean, Here's hoping the sequel will be better. But I have my doubts. I'm still VERY critical about this game in-spite of the Internet echo chamber saying otherwise. Maybe it'll be on-par with Skyrim or Saints Row. If you were to ever get this game, Do yourselves a favor and get it on some sort of discount.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

stealthninja,03-04-2017,"This Legend of Zelda game is a great game if you have never played any other Zelda game before it. As a veteran Zelda player the game is very weak and is the most unZelda like game in the series, but we will get into that.

First lets start with what the game does very well.

1) Environment - It is beautiful and expansive. There is literally no where you cant go. You can climb up strait walls and across great valleys. There are no invisible walls (except map borders). There are secrets around almost every corner.

2)Combat - Beautiful flow between swings and dodges. Lock on works wonders. Bow and arrows are a tough but rewarding weapon to master.

3)Citizens - The people of the world are the most colorful of the series. They have so much to say and they bring the world to life. There are countless numbers of them. Its great.

From here on are the negatives. Most of which are Zelda title inconsistencies and annoyances.

1)The Master Sword and Hyrule Shield - They have to be found and earned, which is fine, but they BREAK?! Why does a sword and shield that has lasted a millennia, designed to strike down pure evil, and magical break?

2)Tunics - There is ONE. and its blue! and you can only get it after completing every single shrine. To little to late. The only other tunics you can get are amiibo collectibles. Which are basically in game cheats.

3)Ganon - why does it have to be some strange bull mist. Cant we have another original bad guy. So many other Zelda titles dont have Ganon at all.

4) Dungeons - There are NONE.....the things they call dungeons in this game are shrines. They are five minute challenges. You can figure out almost every one of them as soon as you come down the elevator. These are a cheap cop out to the notoriously difficult dungeons typically found in the series.

5)Sheikah Slate - apparently Link has a cell phone now. You have gps, camera, photo gallery, way points, apps, and firmware updates. This set of features should be stripped from the game entirely.

- The apps (i call them superpowers) are infinite. There is no magic bar to restrict over use. There is no logical reason as to why link has any of them. There is no backstory to the individual powers. The power to lift any size metal object with ease used to be confined to an object called the power bracelet. Which no longer exists. The ability to stop time feels forced. In any other title you would have unlocked such a power after ten plus hours. not one or less hours. Bombs used to grow in the ground. and Ice blocks are unnecessary. They all feel like they were late game development tack ons to make the player feel more powerful.
- The camera - This is another feature that is handed to you, not earned. Its mostly used for dinky side missions that require more than one photo from multiple angles to be able to complete it. It also has an enormous photo album. No more getting your photos processed, no more limited album sizes, no more upgrades, and once again no more backstory.
-GPS - the map is grand and expansive. Yet it is littered with way points and points of interest. Why cant we have just a town teleport and nothing else on the map. Instead everything is given to you and i feel no real challenge navigating the great supposedly wild terrain.
-Shiekah Shrine Indicator - easily the most annoying thing in the game. The thing constantly beeps in your face like crying navi. All there needs to be is a mute option for the thing. Instead when im shrine hunting i end up muting the whole game. Simply because a few shrines are on cliff sides and it will beep beep your mind away for the twenty minutes your climbing from cliff to cliff.

6) Enemies - Some are a good homage to the series, but others feel unnatural. Since when are there robot octopus turrets? or centaurs? and instead of making more bad looking baddies they just change the color to determine the difficulty. LAME. Even their outposts are the same skull in the ground from one side of the map to the other.

7)The Korok seeds - another example of a tacked on feature. You can often find them in obvious places, They are very simple to complete, and pose almost no real value to the game except the characters themselves.

8)Timeline - This game is probably on a new time stream all by itself. Making connections to several parallel Hyrules at once. Good luck trying to figure out where it goes.

9) Sheikah Tech - Has never existed before. It feels very alien with all the ugly glowing towers, bland environments, squiggly symbols, and steampunk armor. Its unnatural to the series.

10) Wild - I have never felt like i was trying to survive. Nor does the environment make you scream help im lost. So why have it in the title?

In the end this is a fun game to play. But its downfalls put it at the bottom of my list of favorite Zelda games. Which is unfortunate.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
clonc,17-12-2017,"Mostly boring. No story, no characters, no zelda items, just one big boring world with either a chest, a korok seed or a shrine to find. Nothing else. A few boring sidequests maybe.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
shanetac1,24-05-2017,"I am going to start by saying I love Zelda games! LTTP is my fav. I completed LBW as well and loved that game. I enjoyed Wind Waker as well. This game was a huge let down though. I was so looking forward to it that we even drove around the city trying to find a copy of it.
This game does not deserve any praise, it is below average and unmemorable. It is a mash up of other games and does not do anything amazing that we have not seen before.

Graphics:
As this is a port from a next gen console the graphics look terrible. The frame rate sucks. Often freezing during the combat and in towns . The animation style is down to opinion but i didn't like it. A Black horse for example is just one shade of Black so makes it look extremely 2D.

Sound:
There is barely any music. The music they did use is okay but just makes the empty world feel truly empty.
The voice acting just seems added in as a last thought as it is only used sparingly. It is terrible so maybe that was a good thing. Every time i heard Zelda speak (or should I say whine) i cringed.

Story:
What story? There are just a ton of cringe worthy flashbacks. A good game has a strong story that dictates the game. The game developers tried to pass this game off as ""hey do what you want"" as if that was a good thing but I think that was just them running out of time and hence the reason there is a new story coming in DLC. It is really another money grab. The game should have come with a story.

Game play:
Key word here is repetitive. If you love repetitive open world games with easy combat like Minecreaft you will love this.
The over world is empty unless you like repeating the same things over and over for no reward.
The side quests are total crap. Just run and fetch quests again for rewards that are just generic rubbish you can normally find anywhere.
We completed all 120 shrines in this game, never got stuck and there is nothing memorable about any of them. They are all largely the same thing with the same skills you earn straight away in the game. It is extremely boring and repetitive to find and complete them all although some of them are hidden quite well. By the end I realized the chests weren't worth getting in the shrines (oh look a piece of topaz you can get by just hitting a rock on the mountain) and that we were just wasting our time.
I played with my daughter who is 14 and by her own admission she sucks at videos games. She completed all the bosses by herself, no issues. The bosses are cookie cutter, nothing memorable about any of them. I wonder if they purposely dumbed these down for the minecraft generation it looks like they were looking to attract? There are no dungeons. The beasts are just bigger versions of the shrines.
Ganon barely features. You can go fight him whenever you want but apart from that he is not seen anywhere else. He was incredibly easy for my daughter to beat. She didn't die once.
The supposed strongest monsters, Lynels and Guardians, are easy to defeat. There is a hard mode you can purchase but who wants to waste more money?
There are barely any monsters in this huge open world, just palette swaps of the same creatures. The chests aren't worth bothering with as there is nothing interesting to find that you can't find elsewhere. The koroks seeds again just the same repetitive puzzles. The towns are small and sell exactly the same items. You really do not care about any of the characters either as they have no depth.
The climbing is cool apart from when it is raining. There just is no point to the rain apart to frustrate you. The glider can be fun at first as well but soon becomes tiresome.
The need to survive the elements is also quite annoying as you have to keep switching out your armour. Just seems pointless as you break game play each time to switch out your armour.
Same goes for weapons breaking. We ended up just using the Master Sword the majority of the time and even that has a cool down period. Part of the excitement about an RPG type game where you find loot is collecting the games best weapons. This makes them into consumables and in the end you stop bothering to even open chests as its usually only rubbish anyway. As mentioned earlier the same goes for the chests in the Shrines. The Shines are just to get an extra heart piece that you do not really even need.

Verdict:
This game is like Minecraft with Zelda branding. I believe it was rushed out as well to make the release date for the Switch. The over world is empty unless you want to mine rocks and find food ala Minecraft. The base camps are exactly the same thing. Slash at the same creatures, get a crummy chest, rinse and repeat.
This game is not fit to lace Link to the Past or Ocarina of times boots. This is just a crummy kids open world game that has had a Zelda face over to help it sell. This game isn't even close to being a classic and should not be mentioned in the same breath as those games.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Not to mention the terrible frame rate and lack of any AA, this is terrible for a new console to not even be able to run a port at 900p with 0AA at a steady 30fps, only made worse by the left Joycon constantly disconnecting.

Inanis,08-03-2017,"playing this and Horizon atm.. and all i can say is that even tho the story is somewhat good .. the graphics and mechanic feel so cheap and over used.. the game feels somewhat rushed,, and the (big) world feels empty.. such a waste of space. the puzzles in the dungeons are really simple (havent found any that took me more than half a minute to figure out) .. and even the exploration mechanic in the open world are all things that have been done before .. (except the shield slide...) .. and the world is big... sadly it feels mostly empty .. there are enemies scatters about (even tho i feel i keep fighting the same 20 enemy types over and over again, im only 6 hrs into the game so mebe further along ill see more variety).

It is a good game.. but it feels like it belongs in the last gen .. im pretty sure i could play it (eevn if with lowered graphics) on my tablet.

Recomendation: play it and judge yourself , the game isnt bad.. but a lot of people are giving it more merit that it deserves just because is Zelda and from nintendo, If you got a Wii try it rigth away just dont go and buy a switch just for the game (i did.. now i got a switch with a scratched screen.. from the dock!.. it should have come with a screen protector imho) .. if you do get the switch then be ware you have to buy the screen protector and a case.. that plastic is kinda delicate.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DavidJS,30-10-2017,"It's hard to find anything positive to say about this game. If the horrific frame rate and frame dips (I've had 5-10 fps in some cases) and eye ripping aliasing aren't enough to put you off, then the rest of the game's flaws certainly will.

The gameplay is incredibly stale and unchallenging. Most of your time is spent awkwardly travelling between different shrines to complete ""puzzles"". I put puzzles in quotations because if you managed to get past kindergarten then you will have no problem ""solving"" these. One of the most difficult things in the game is trying to manage and guide a ball to a socket with frustrating and poorly designed motion controls. Due to how easy the game is, you don't feel any sense of accomplishment (unless you are rather stupid and easily pleased, which is fine, we all have our opinions) and this is the game's biggest downfall. A fair reviewer will weight this into their overall rating. A paid reviewer, a reviewer too scared to give the game a rating below a 9.9 because of peer pressure and expectation or a reviewer giving the game a 10/10 to justify their purchase will not weight this huge negative into their review score.

Music is one of the biggest and most underrated parts of a video game. Sometimes people like a game and don’t even realise that the music is a big reason why. I’m sad to say that the music in Breath of The Wild is incredibly disappointing, unforgettable and pales in comparison to the music from games like Ocarina of Time. A fair reviewer will weight this into their overall rating.

The main storyline is nothing special and struggles to excite. This is partly due to most of the game being about visiting silly shrine “puzzles”, taking the focus and immersion of the main story away from the gamer. A fair reviewer will weight this into their overall rating.

The controls can, at times, feel unsmooth and a chore to pilot. For example, riding a horse can be frustrating when your horse takes 5 seconds to recover every time it hits an invisible or non-obvious barrier. Getting around the map also becomes tiresome and boring due to the emptiness between objectives. The game tries to fill in these empty gaps by providing filler content like allowing players to make food such as a fragrant mushroom sauté. Sounds awesome right? Maybe, but it isn’t awesome. There is very little difference between certain foods and the game would have been better off having fewer options when it comes to making recipes. The abundance of options is merely a way to create an illusion of content and only serves to add an unnecessary amount of confusion to the game. A fair reviewer will weight this into their overall rating.

As I said, it’s hard to find anything positive to say about this game. The art of the game is fantastic, but is unfortunately spoiled by the poor frame rate and aliasing. The opening is fairly captivating, but the story soon becomes uninteresting and is pushed aside by boring shrine puzzle gameplay. The only thing that kept me engaged in the game was the hope that it would become exciting, but it never did.

Overall I found the game to be extremely disappointing. I am usually very careful of positive reviews, but given that this game had such a high critic rating I decided to try it. It only showed me how bad and unreliable reviews are nowadays. Given that the game is below average, I'm giving it a below average rating. Don't fall into the trap of trusting these 10/10 reviews. They are blinded by hype and peer pressure, are too scared to give it an honest rating and aren’t taking into consideration any of the game’s flaws, and believe me, it has many.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I'm not saying say the troll are in the right but to lump us all who have problems with this game together with the trolls is wrong especially when a lot of the mixed and negative reviews I've read have legitimate points (not all of them, of course) which I happen to agree with. Breath Of The Wild isn't a bad game, it's got a nice art style and it controls decently (though so of the button placement is annoying) but it's an incredibly derivative open world game that adds little to nothing to the genre, the gameplay also gets really repetitive after a while and the frame rate is really bad, I shouldn't be playing an action game where the game freezes for several seconds. Story is nothing special and the voice acting and very hit and miss. While I could see someone who's never played this type of game before really getting into it, I myself have played plenty of open world games and rpgs and this game did very little to impress me. Considering that Skyward Sword (aka the worst 3D main Zelda game as well as a mediocre game) has a 93 on metacritic, I shouldn't be surprised that this game is as highly reviewed as it is, Why is this the best game ever?

There are several perfect scores in the critic page, and even more in the user submitted page, but those of us who are NOT paid to promote the game have a vastly different opinion of it.

Namely, that this game is incredibly underwhelming, in pretty much every way imaginable. Combat is uninspired, the crafting mechanics feel tacked on, the AI is easily exploited especially when objects are in the way, and the story is.... well... laughably bad. The game features repetitive puzzles and embarrassing use of reskinned enemies. The framerate issues and objects in the distance popping in and out is horrible to experience. This game is simply not worth your time in any sense of the word. It is, in essence, an Assassin's Creed type game.

indi01,27-02-2019,"I’ve loved Zelda since I was a kid and I was very eager to try out this new title.
It REALLY pains me to write the following, it’s like being heart broken. I have no hope Nintendo will listen and I know I’d be downvoted into oblivion but I’ll write anyway.

If I had to find a word to denote this game, that would be “tedious”. How can we accomplish the goal of making this game as tedious as possible?

First we can make a massive empty slow-paced open world. It takes an endless amount of time to traverse this, walking, running, on horse doesn’t matter. Then of course swimming, climbing etc all have to be tedious, with that stamina bar, which in Skyward Sword was almost bearable because the world was smaller but here it is not.

Then we can make everything dependent on cooking and selling, so you are forced to collect stuff and always stop to cook (long gone is the beautiful grass with rupees and hearts...).

Then (at least at the beginning) enemies, even low tier ones are very very dangerous and can one hit kill you. So you’ll see the game over screen again and again, and you’ll have to start over. More tediousness.

Don’t get me started on the rain which forces you to put down the controller and wait until it goes away.

Then we have no dungeons. Yes I know that this is not a major gripe but still, dungeons were unique and challenging places which were part of any great Zelda game, it really makes no sense they were removed completely.

Then there’s the story...well, I get that Zelda should not be a literary masterpiece but after so many years perhaps we can get something more elaborate than what we see here. Past games like Twilight Princess or Majora’s Mask did it so why can’t this one?

The music? Well, do you remember all those memorable songs from Ocarina of Time, Link's Awakening etc? None of that is here.

All of this, maybe just maybe, I might have been able to forgive. But of course it couldn’t stop there.
We have to make all weapons and gear breakable after a few swings.
This completely kills for me any sense of progression and it makes fighting a chore to the point that I would rather avoid altogether.

It seems this game was designed for people who have hundreds of free hours to play a game and like to stare at digital landscapes. Unfortunately that person is not me and if the next Zelda game follows this template I will sadly have to skip it.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ianmalcolm99,08-08-2018,"Highly disappointing. Puzzles are way too simple, enemy variety is non existent, no one asked for weapons breaking, story was made out to be a huge thing in trailers etc and then was just totally non existent when you play the game. By having all runes available from start it barely feels like you're making any meaningful progress - the only things are shrines and korok seeds. Once you get a few decent weapons/shields/bows and the master sword both of these things are irrelevant as the cooking system is incredibly unbalanced making having more hearts mean nothing other than them being a requirement to get the master sword, and more inventory space, while nice, isn't worth looking for 900 seeds only to get nothing worthwhile at the end. Bosses are easily the worst in the entire series, especially the final boss which barely even makes any attempt at attacking you. It just sits there taking a beating, occasionally shooting a laser in front of itself, not even a laser aimed at you. Characters were boring or annoying, dungeons (divine beasts) were boring and all recycled the same theme as the shrines and the same puzzles as the other divine beasts. World is totally unrealistic, can go from stormy mountains to rainforest with no attempts at blending anything - it just feels like everything was thrown wherever it could fit.

Wineneeder,12-05-2018,"Zelda, by way of Ubisoft.

This feels like Farcry tried to be Zelda. It has a lot of the quirky Zelda things, it has the art design, it has the characters, but there's things that are deeply wrong.

For starters, there's no dungeons. They've removed them, as far as I can tell and I'm like four hours in. No dungeon, in a Zelda game. Instead, what they've done is cut everything away from them, except puzzle room, and turn them into shrines.

No bossfights, no thematic change to them, no new opportunities from finding new items or completing them. Every shrine is essentially the same and there's 42 of them, so far they have all ended the same way and only two have had me do anything more complex than a physics puzzle and that was just memorize their floors and teleport back to sort them. Also these two are on the way before you unlock the camera, so I had to go online and cheat the floor pattern, because I messed one of them up. Greaaat game design.

Speaking of the slate, now instead of new items and abilities and everything that was to the Zelda experience, you are off the bat, within the first 20 to 40 minutes given: bombs, ice power, magnet power, stasis power and a hangglider. Five dungeons worth of equipment, hours of play, are given to you in the starting area. These are the last real utilities you will get.

Instead now, you manage weapons, shields and bows, and food. They break, all the time. You will swing the early weapons, 3-4 times and they break. This is pretty irritating. You upgrade slots and HP by randomly finding leaf guys or following beeps to a shrine.

Honestly I don't feel like going on and i feel I've made my point. This is the least Zelda-esque of all Zelda games, maybe even Spirit Tracks. This game is so beyond anemic. I will just drop some unsorted comments here.

There's 120 to collect, but they just give you more stamina or health, what was always quite dramatically given to you after a boss fight, traditionally in Zelda. (I guess there's armor unlocked at the end, but who really cares.)
There's NINE HUNDRED korok seeds, which just upgrade your inventory slots, which is useful since you'll go through a ton of weapons, greaaat. I've found about 4, randomly in the wilderness. And that's what this game is, everything just barfed out in one big world zone. The closest thing to this would be the gold skulltula's from Ocarina, but even those were often found together, along the way and later versions reduced the number of those considerably.
It is pretty telling too, that all the story goes on in the past. The current world is open and generic, it feels brain dead and lacking. You'll fight the same enemies over and over for really no reward besides parts or their crummy weapons. It wants me to find 11 places from pictures Zelda left on her iPhone and after the first one, there's no hint as to where. I don't want to travel around and find them. That sounds like busy work, like most of the game.

I don't want to go on, in this rant of a review or the game. This is a Zelda in the way Hyrule Warriors is, brand only. What this should have been is another big concept change, like Wind Waker. Or something as dense and foreboding as Majora's Mask, this time with a larger budget and not rushed. I haven't even mentioned the farce that is Amiibos in this game, and if I was to type it out, I'd probably want to sell my Nintendo Switch. It is that much of a joke. It is not only ineptly handled and impossible to find (people are making fake ones out of circuit stickers!), but DLC at the absolute, ABSOLUTE worst.

This series used to be about completing dungeons and heroic tasks, and being rewarded with new tools in the world. Now you just upgrade your health or inventory space. It was based of the childish play Shigeru Miyamoto, wandering and pretending to be a hero. I think it is pretty clear he wasn't in charge of this, or involved at all.

What we have here, is Zelda pretending to be Farcry.

My Disappointment Is Immeasurable.jpg",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
j-s,15-03-2017,"Be wary of people giving this game a high score. They just might be trying to sell you on something.

Things it did right:
+ Huge world with lots of little details, probably where Nintendo spent most of their time in development
+ The go-anywhere-and-possibly-be-undergeared motif of LoZ1 was translated to a 3D game alright enough
+ Made the mastersword rely on heart containers to acquire it, much like the White Sword or Magical Sword from LoZ1. Probably the only specific callback to LoZ1 that translated ""perfectly"".

Things it tried:
• Redesigned many characters, going as far as never giving Link a hat in promotional art and changing his iconic color from green to blue, or Ganon who is now a demon spider instead of a pig, only a pig in spirit. Moblins were turned into weird long snouted lanky unicorn pigmonsters, Hinox were turned into somewhat-more-generic Giants losing their iconic(?) Bomb-throwing attacks.
• Tried voice acting but traded player-freedom of naming their character so spoken lines could needlessly refer to you as ""Link"".
• The go-anywhere-model of LoZ1 lost almost all likeness to most other Zelda games because of the way it was implemented. In order to go anywhere and do anything from the start of the game, the player unfortunately gets all their tools at the start of the game so no proper dungeons with proper treasures or item equipment that would otherwise lock one player from accessing things another player could gated via game progress- which also isn't necessarily even ""true"" to how LoZ1 accomplished it.

Things it did wrong:
- Traded the sweeping and catchy good music of traditional Zelda design even going as far back as the original LoZ1 for lighter, emptier, less-frequent ambient sounds to adapt to the world's environment of ""musical"" cues and reliance on things like stealth. As an original game this might have worked, but the tradeoff meaning no great ""Zelda music"" as many expect from the franchise doesn't work to a benefit. The weaker audio design fits their game design, but the weaker audio design of their game design doesn't fit ""Zelda"".
- From a series known for streamlined access to health replenishment via bottles full of potions and frequent floating hearts, placing all healing behind food collection and menu access gets in the way of player intention within the world and only serves to distract the player or otherwise pad the adventure with unnecessary filler. Trivial for a series that virtually invented the concept behind the Estus Flask from the Souls games. Such an estus-flask-like method of healing would have more accurately emulated the streamlined healing of past Zelda games while still allowing them to get away from hearts in bushes and pots.
- Related to food collection, the game design around killing simple non-zelda scenery animals unrelated to the variety of Zelda enemies for various Raw Meat items is woefully unnecessary and out-of-place for any Zelda game much less any Nintendo game. This concept was so poorly implemented to even include killing foxes and wolves for meat, in our modern society where both have been domesticated as pets or otherwise crossbred with domestic dogs to produce canines that look identical to their wild counterparts. Whether the player has the intent or not to harm them, they can be killed by enemies anyway. ""Eating dog meat"" is a gut-wrenching phrase I never imagined would describe an action in any videogame much less one from Nintendo, and has forever irreparably damaged my otherwise flawless opinion of the franchise and its creators.
- No actual sprawling dungeons from a series known for it's sprawling dungeons is a weakpoint. The shrines, although numerous and fairly uniquely designed in terms of their puzzles, unfortunately still manage to all look identical and don't offer the same expected gameplay layout or scenic/regional design as cohesive interconnected hallways and rooms from traditional dungeons in other Zelda games. Even the four Divine Beasts operate more like ""slightly larger shrines"" than something remotely close to being considered a true ""dungeon"", with Hyrule Castle being the only ""true"" dungeon.
- Enemy variety compared to past Zelda games and even many modern games is staggeringly low. All enemies and bosses counted, there are only 23 different monsters that are copied-pasted-and-recolored or given a slightly different weapon or elemental attribute to create the majority of Breath of the Wild's ""variety"". Even going back to Ocarina of Time, there were 46 unique enemies and bosses counted together, not including recolored or reskinned variations; and of course each mainline Zelda game since Ocarina and before Breath of the Wild has had virtually the same variety if not more. There are actually more background scenery animal species in this game than unique enemies, meaning the only true visual variety that exists is in the scenery itself - a negative only because enemy combat is a necessity",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The gameplay is good until u use ur sheika slate. Shrines are boring with easy puzzle there was only 1 where it puzzled me. The gameplay is the only part I liked but for 80 bucks no. The enemies are reppetitive. To top it all of the final bossfight was probabley the most unstasisfying thing I've done in the game. The boss was way 2 easy considering That I spent 50 hours honing my skills. If you're looking for a game with fun gameplay. This is it.

B4CR0N6,20-03-2017,"The game has several major flaws. The final boss is too easy to defeat and can be reached without defeating the 4 main bosses. The number of bosses is half of the amount in previous Zelda games-- 4 beast bosses in the current game compared to 7-8 bosses of older Zelda games. The frame rate drops to staggering levels very often. The overall color of the game and environment is pale and there is lots of glare.

The final boss and ending were disappointing. There was no dialogue-- both Link and Gannon were mute. The final form of Gannon, when defeated, did not explode after an animation build up . Symbolic to an anticlimactic ending, the defeated Gannon merely vanished and faded. This felt conflicting and inadequate.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kouyou,21-03-2017,"Maybe that would be ""the"" game for me in my childhood .. but today, i feel disappointed.
Note, that is not a bad game - far from it! But .. it is not made for the me that is right now.
Hell, what am I writing?

Well, basically: Zelda doesn't shine nowhere besides scope, sheer size and possibilities. Not that this is a bad thing, quiet the opposite, however: scope and possibilities consume time. So it should mean the most possible enjoyment during consuming aforementioned time.

And though i can enjoy it .. i don't enjoy the way I enjoyed the Witcher with his gritty evil dark fantasy world. Less then Uncharted, with it's awesome visuals and cinematic action. Less then Nier with it's incredible story. Less then Nioh with it's unique and incredible swordplay. Less then Horizon with it's fresh concept and even more incredible visuals.

So ..do i just dislike the look of the game?
Na, that's not it.
I enjoyed games like root letter because i wanted to play a visual novel. I enjoyed some shooters because at times i enjoy shooters.

Breath of the Wild though, well, it doesn't live up to my expectations. Melee combat feels bad. The grind feels too long and not really rewarding. The world at a larger scale feels generic. I miss the details. Something that sets it apart for me. Though there were a few things i loved (visually too) - like navigating through the labyrinthine forest until i figured out to follow the wind - the game rarely touched me.

Maybe, i just grew out of the franchise. Maybe i just don't like the look. Maybe i just expected more.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

crd2897,24-08-2017,"Well to start off with the good. I enjoy the games open world it truly seems endless and I get lost in the vast beauty that this game has to offer. the character voice acting in some parts was pretty awsome honestly surprised me a little because I was not expecting that. On to the terrible. First off limited inventory is insanely annoying but I could live with. Battle mechanics Where mostly terrible because the controls where something different and it got annoying. Example, lock on to an enemy with your weapon out with shield raised, if you accidentally push too hard on the left move wheel on the controller you will crouch and lose guard I have died several times cause of that. alot of times when I go and find enemies I fight them then theres always one that hits me one time and I am dead. Then another terrible aspect is the weapon and shield breaking. heck fire I swing my sword 5 times and it breaks during battle. I spend more time switching weapons and shields out then I do exploring the game. and its very annoying when you are fighting a hard enemy then your sword randomly breaks and you are too focused on the battle to notice the message pop up saying your sword broke then you try to strike well tough luck that enemy hits you one time, you just died. and love it when my shield breaks(Sarcasm). I would be blocking an enemies attack then my shield breaks. good lord this game has way to many weapon and shield breaks. it it lasted a lot longer I would enjoy the game more. til then I am debating on returning this to the Game stop and telling them my horror story",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Megafont88,04-05-2018,"Breath of the Wild was not that great. I've been a huge Zelda fan for a long time, and this one managed to disappoint me. It is easily one of the most flawed titles in the series. The essence of Zelda is largely missing because it is so diluted in Botw. The game feels like a generic open world with a Zelda skin slapped on it far moreso than like a Zelda game.

It's missing proper, unique dungeons with keys and unique bosses. Some have said Hyrule Castle is a dungeon too, but I disagree. Unlike the divine beasts, it is very hard to call Hyrule Castle a dungeon. Why? Because there is virtually nothing dungeon-like about it by Zelda standards. It's just a large area to explore, though its music is awesome. Overall, Botw's music is sadly the most lacking soundtrack of any Zelda game, though.

The world is huge and beautiful, but vast chunks of it feel like they only exist to expand the world size. For some bizarre reason, there are virtually no caves (which is dumb). It's an open world that is also quite empty. Exploration falls flat, as there isn't much to find aside from korok seeds, shrines, enemy camps, and chests that generally contain useless early game weapons that are too weak to use anymore (or rarely they contain some rupees). Rupees are too rare and under-utilized. They brought back stamina, but it’s designed much better than in Zelda: Skyward Sword. The enemy variety in Botw's world is quite lacking, being far outdone by past games with far smaller worlds.

Most of the story is in the past, making it feel distant and separated from the player's current actions.

The early game experience was one of the worst in the series. It's far more unforgiving than it should be, especially in its normal mode. This resulted in Link feeling like a complete weakling compared to most of his other incarnations. Botw has more tedium and annoyance than all other 3D Zelda games combined and more than most 2D ones too. The atrociously balanced weapon system is very tedious in the early game and not fun. Climbing is also very tedious, especially with how it rains every 5 seconds or any time you step within 5ft of a cliff. It gets better as you increase your max stamina, but is still tedious on huge mountains.

The game's cooking system is cool, but it has a huge flaw. There is no screen that lets you view the recipes you've already discovered. This is an incredibly dumb design flaw given how many recipes there are in Botw.

Even the Master Sword and Hylian Shield have durability in Botw, which is one of the dumbest design choices in series history. It literally makes no sense in the context of Zelda history.

Nintendo also milked this game like never before at launch and after. Some costumes had no business being behind amiibo, like Fierce Diety. It may be equivalent to another armor, but there was one and only one reason they locked it behind an amiibo. That was because they knew lots of players would want that one. In other words, it was a cash grab. Some materials were grossly overused in the armor upgrade system, causing another source of tedium. Star fragments are the worst, but lynel materials are also a stupid chore to farm. The way amiibo scanning works is dumb, too. This is because of how many times you have to try to get costume pieces sometimes. It's stupid and pointless.

Overall, Botw is sadly a bit of a lackluster experience compared to most past Zelda games. This game just doesn’t stand up to most other Zelda adventures. It tried to sell its soul and be something it is not.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AJY84,05-06-2019,"I really wanted to like this game, and I do have to say that it is an okay open-world game. Had Nintendo called it anything else, I doubt it would have received the praise it has. The Legend of Zelda name is attached to it, but it doesn't feel like one. They changed absolutely everything, except for the heart containers; the one thing that honestly could've been done away w/ in favour of an exp/leveling system. Instead, you're forced to complete shrines that are short, uninspired, boring, and when forced to use motion controls in them, they're downright miserable. And you need to complete four in order to have enough spirit orbs to either upgrade your hearts or stamina meter. Speaking of which, when you upgrade the stamina meter, they truly cheat you on how much is added. I know of the biggest bragging points this boasts is how you can climb everything and everywhere. Which is true... Unless it's raining... Which happens 95% of the time. I literally watched two episodes of a show (22mins a piece) waiting out the ridiculous rain just so I could finally climb a piece of wood that allowed me to get to a tower. To me, this is one of the absolute worst Legend of Zelda games ever made. I cannot wait for Link's Awakening to drop so I can rid my memory of this hot garbage.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
CyberRobotnix,19-12-2017,"What did this game do wrong? The following things precisely:

• Exploration feels unrewarding as all you find are Koroks and sometimes Shrines

• The Shrines themselves are too easy and basic and all look the same

• The story is disappointing as all the interesting events happened 100 years ago

• No traditional dungeons

• The dungeons which the game does have are too short and easy

• Overworld music is boring

• Sidequests for the most part are underdeveloped and give crappy rewards

• Durability is a terrible system and devalues any weapon you get

• Everything destroys you at the beginning of the game, but at the end, you’re extremely overpowered and the entire game becomes a joke

• Ganon is just a mindless monster that for some reason doesn’t talk; the boss fight against him is also way too easy

• Horses are completely useless

• Despite what the story implies, there is literally no sense of urgency to defeat Ganon

• Enemy variety is absolutely terrible

• Some costumes and weapons are locked behind amiibo

Spazzh20,18-11-2017,"Breath of the wild wastes no time attempting to suck you into its world with gorgeous visuals and music. But don’t be fooled it doesn’t matter how beautiful the icing is that you put on a cake, if the cake is made of poop.
The phrase Jack of all trades master of none is the best way I can describe Zelda Breath Of The Wild. It tries so many different things but none of them are ever fully developed. It feels as though Nintendo just took a bunch ideas for different smartphone games and compiled them into a $60 AAA game that tries to be so many things that it lacks its own identity.

Upon starting the game and awaking from your 100 year slumber you will most likely try to start up the main quest. However in order to do so you must first complete a side quest for an old man who tells you that you must complete a task for him so that he will give you the means of transportation that you need to explore this world. After completing it he tells me that he wants me to do more for him in exchange for a paraglider and the game forces you to obey if you want to traverse the world. At this point less than 1 hour into the game, it already felt extremely flawed. In a game like Skyrim if someone tries to screw you over you can fight them and change the course of the game. Sure they might not like you but that’s the point of an open world game, making every decision feel like your own. If I was link I would have said **** you old man give me the Paraglider or I’ll stomp your ass into the ground.”

A true open world game would let you make decisions that affect people's perception of you and make the game easier or harder depending on your choices. Sure some people in the game might not like you if you don’t help them, but I can’t think of a time when not helping someone lead to a moment in the story where that person wants revenge or tries to make your life difficult. When I think of the term “next gen Zelda” I thought that Nintendo would finally give you choices that stuck with you and made you contemplate the morality of the situation. Wouldn’t it be cool if there was a situation where you had to lie to someone or betray someone who trusted you to get what you wanted, and then choosing to do so made them detest you throughout the rest of the game? Or how about giving you the option to not kill certain enemies, and bosses, and those same enemies and bosses end up helping you against the game’s final boss.

But hey it’s not the story right it’s gameplay that matters, and boy does Zelda Breath Of The Wild
have a lot of it. And somehow Nintendo managed to make the gameplay both too primitive and too complicated at the same time.
One of the games features is letting you cut down trees with weapons for wood. When I stumbled across an enemy standing on top of a makeshift wooden ramp I thought to myself that I would be able to cut the thin wooden beams holding it up but when I tried it wouldn’t work. So you're telling me that Link is strong enough to cut down a massive oak tree with just 2 swings of an axe but a makeshift ramp that is clumsily put together with thin wooden support beams can’t be cut down.

I remember PS2 games that let you destroy wooden guard posts. “Next Gen” my ass.
Also why does swimming slowly cause you to lose stamina. Just like in Skyward Sword you have a stamina bar and it depletes quickly. I knew that swimming fast would probably cause it to diminish, but when I was just casually swimming slowly it went down. And when I just stood still in the water the stamina would not regenerate. And if that’s not bad enough when you are swimming and run out of stamina instead of just restarting you near the body of water, you lose health. Even when the water was only a few feet deep Link still drowned. How is link such a pansy that he drowns in water no deeper than a kiddy pool?
So Link drowns in 2 meters of water yet he is strong enough to climb mountains with his bare hands, and traverse dangerous environments like Lava with ease. See what I mean when I say that the rules don’t make any sense.
There's also a weapon upgrade system that I rarely ever used because weapons are so plentiful that it’s easier to just use the weapons that you pick up rather than spending dozens of hours to find the right materials to upgrade them.
Finally the combat sucks ass.
It was extremely difficult to target a specific enemy when there were lots of them, and the new weapon throwing mechanic gave my fingers carpal tunnel syndrome. You have to hold down R1 on the controller to aim where you want to throw your weapon and release it to throw your weapon. If you want to cancel the throw you have to press R2. However with my big sausage fingers this became difficult. Every time I accidentally pushed R1 I had to move my index finger to the top left of the button while using my middle finger to press R2. Why couldn’t you just aim with R1 and throw with R2.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

You plan something out like "" Ok, I see that tower in the distance, lets go get that now."" and 3 hours later you find yourself 10 shrines in, doing side quests, and catching that awesome Black and orange horse that seems impossible to tame, without even touching the tower.
Yes this game has some flaws.
-Frame rate is great most the time, but does tend to dip down every once in a while.
-Resolution could be better being 2017.
-There is a lot of unused space in the game, but I think that adds to the beauty of the game.
-I do have to say some of the voice acting (En Language) does seem cheesy at times. (I'm probably gonna get ripped a new one for that.)
**There are probably more, and I'm sure there is, but this is, so far, what I have ran into personally. I haven't watched any spoilers, botw lets plays, or streams, not even a review.**

-The amount of Pros for this game is too much for me to put on here.
-The subtle music will give you goosebumps.
-The quiet landscape gives you a sense of a giant open world.
-The combat is punishing at times, but with the items that you receive from shrines and chest found in the wilderness, you can go to that camp of Bokoblins that have been destroying earlier and take them out once in for all!!!
-The shrines test your mind in simple, or seemingly impossible puzzles that make you go ""Ooohh I see how I can complete this"" after about 5-30 minutes of looking around.
-The 4 Divine Beasts, with challenging puzzles and Epic rewards. sure there is only 4, but there are also 100 shrines and world bosses, ganon. Not to mention the side quests, collecting materials, picture taking, Korok seeds, mini games, the master sword!!!...

The side quests are nothing special. The main quests are not clear and quite confusing. But the game itself is incredible. The shrines provide a nice change of pace from the world.

Random enemy encounters are also able to be overcame by multiple ways, the game doesn't force you to solve a puzzle or defeat an enemy in a particular way, it is up to you.

Maxman1414,13-03-2017,"After about 100 hours I have come to a conclusion about this game. I have finished the game and I have to say that compared to the other Zelda games it is quite fun. I absolutely adore the aesthetic of the game although I do prefer the handheld's graphics opposed to tv mode (though I'm not sure if it's my tv's fault or the Switch's) as for the music for the most part I liked although it is different than Zelda's usual tunes that get stuck in your head for hours, this game's soundtrack is mostly forgettable. What I found most upsetting of the music was the fact that not all songs from the game are on the soundtrack that comes with the special and master edition of the game. The story of the game is not the best but certainly not the worst easily ranking in the top 3 storylines of all Zelda games. I believe that a really good story should be able to make me shed at least one tear and sadly enough this game wasn't able to. Lastly I come to the gameplay though out the 100 hours I believe I only experienced 3 pretty big lag spikes usually in areas where there were lots of trees (which may or may not have been on fire) and alot of wind like in Rito Village, one of the main areas of the game. To be perfectly honest though I don't really mind lag as long as the game doesn't drop to around 15 frames per second. The puzzles I normally found pretty easy but I was never really stumped in other Zelda games so it might just be me. The dungeons yes they only have four however other zelda's also had 4 like Majora's mask and that is probably one of my favorite games of all time, to add to that Breath of the Wild also has its 100+ shrines making up more than enough puzzle solving goodness lost by the lack of main dungeons. To further add to that there is also the 900+ Korok seeds to find and a handful of side quests. Also the amount of detail put into each character and enemy is astonishing. As many of you probably know villagers would react to different things like if you try to jump off a bridge people will try to convince you otherwise believing that you are attempting suicide. Different characters respond if your wearing different clothes (or lack of). Bokoblins yell in astonishment when they realize you took their weapon when you knock them out for a brief few seconds. As I said there are so many details within this game that makes it amazing. As for replayability the game doesn't work as well as I found it quite annoying that not all cutscenes are completely skippable and it is pretty hard to not do the same thing twice if you already know an answer that works. Also I wouldn't say there are trully multiple endings as the only difference from what I've played is a 30 second cutscene that doesn't add much. Though you can always try to make your own challenges like right now I'm trying to fully beat the game with 3 hearts and without wearing armor (outside points of which it is required). There should be alot more replayability once the DLC comes out with hero mode and the new dungeon/story.

In conclusion Breath of the Wild is an amazing game with tons of gameplay easily allowing for 100+ hours. The sheer amount of details is astounding and easily makes up for the mediocre music and pretty decent storyline. Yes it has its flaws but that didn't stop me from loving it. Is it Fun? Yeah it is! if you can get your hands on this game I would totally recommend you try it although it may be hard considering Nintendo's incapability to keep any of its hardware in stock.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SuperWeegee,13-03-2017,"This game is amazing, I'll give it that, but people seem to ignore some of it's flaws.

Pros:

- It's a HUGE open world.
- The graphics are great, especially for a portable console.
- The controls move very fluently
- The fact that you constantly have to keep looking for weapons and arrows encourages people to look for better gear and to conserve them.
- The numerous easter eggs you can find.
- Environment is creative and colorful.
- Has enough variety so that it makes you think.
- The puzzles are creative.
- Personally, the difficulty is just right for me. Not too hard, but not too punishing either. I can see where I made a mistake.
Now here are the cons:

- The frame rate can sometimes drop, but this is most noticeable in The Great Plateau. This will be likely fixed in an update.
- Some people might get annoyed at the constant search for weapons and armor.
- People might just not be a fan of open world games in general
- The difficulty might throw some people off, especially children 12 and under.

The pros definitely outweigh the cons, but I can see why people might not like the game as much.

Owlvideogaming,27-03-2017,"Okay, so, this game is Nintendo at their best.
I've played some of their best games from the original Super Mario Bros to Super Metroid to Splatoon; and I can say for certain that they're in fine form. I've had some experience with the Legend of Zelda before, and I loved it, but this takes it to a whole other level. This is probably the most free and non-linear game of all time, or at least very close to it. Rather than make a map and graft paths and story onto it, Nintendo have made a massive map, dispersed story elements and boss fights, and let you loose. The art style is Nintendo through and through, STYLE and BEAUTY over realism: this game nails the open-air feel it set out to capture not by having ultra photo-realistic graphics that imitate the real world to the atomic level, but by conveying the wonder and beauty of the world and creatures through delicious, simple yet complex, visuals and art. The characters are hilarious and relateable, the dialogue is perfect and the voice-acted cutscenes keep the gameplay light and fun and important story moments dramatic and attention-grabbing. Speaking of fun, this is THE most fun game I've ever played. I mostly play games for challenge and story, because they don't focus on fun, only driving you insane with massive challenges and small rewards to keep you coming back. What kept me coming back to BOTW was the FUN, the immense fun. This comes from plentiful mechanics that seek to give and enhance the open feel of the game, without being too realistic and dragging you down. The openness, WOW. If you want to do something one particular crazy way, chances are, you can: there is no limit on height, you can cheat at puzzles, and go wherever you want.
I was hesitant for a long time with scoring this, I'd had such fun, but was worried that it would dwindle and I'd just get used to it. I didn't. I entered a completely new area, extremely hostile and beautiful, full of awesome new characters that had me busting my gut with their ego and ineptitude. The game was fresh again, the variety limitless, the Zelda charm amplified by the new style and risk. I realised that this was the best and most engaging game I'd ever played, and was beyond perfect. Exploration and taking risks were hugely rewarding, and I ended up sacrificing speed and efficiency by not fast-travelling, because the world is so beautiful and exploration is a joy.
My final score for The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The wild is 20/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
solitos,27-03-2017,"Masterpiece is a small word to describe Breath of the Wild.Game cant be compared vs OOT since their logic isn't the same..U don't need to kill bosses with specific dungeon items since it had to be an open world action adventure and not a ""show me where to go and what item i should get first "" Dungeons were kinda easy as well compared to other puzzle dungeons of the same series but..the feelings? From the first glide till the last anagram that gives all players a small smile thinking and reminisce the past game of their childhood this game is a MUST.

ReiAyanami,16-11-2018,"To Accurately review such a disappointing & overrated game a lengthy analysis is Requiered. Part 1:

First let's talk about the hero. In a good story, being an amnesiac means having something interesting in your past. Something that would change you and the world around you upon recollection. That is unless your name is Link.

Recovering your lost memories changes absolutely nothing. Link remains the same empty shell that he was before. You never know what is going through his head. How can there be no character development for the protagonist? You can end the game without getting any of the memories back and nothing would be different. It goes to show just how shallow the story is, because it only matters that you slay Ganon. You can even skip straight to the castle, dismissing everything else be it the people in need or your lost love. You don't care about them, because you're the legendary hero of legend.

And if you can beat the final boss so early in the game, it makes it look like Ganondorf was no big deal after all, and your defeat 100 years ago was a mere fluke. You didn't even need to activate any of the ancient machines to stop him.

The Champions had little screentime, and to think Nintendo actually gave them voices and then had them say things like ""Three terminals left. Good luck."" What a waste. They should've given Link, the protagonist, a voice instead if they had to be selective like that. Mipha is baring her soul before him, and he's just sitting there, saying nothing. It was so awkward I was expecting her to ask what was wrong with him. They had a close relationship, right? So why is it that you never see Link as much as change his expression when they're together? He's treating her the same way he does any other Champion--the silent treatment. Did he love her? What about his opinion on the princess and her troubles? What does he think of his own position in all that is happening? He's so emotionless, so indifferent, it's just awful.

With the inclusion of the voice acting, the issue of his silence is elevated in BotW more than in any other Zelda game, and now Link stands out a lot. In a bad way. Nintendo won't consider giving him a voice and personality, because they're stubborn like that and cling to their traditions, but this tradition exists for its own sake, not because it's anything good. The same can be said about the size of this game's world. It's pointless.

You've heard this one before, how the game world is empty. It's not far from the truth. At one point the game is telling you that you should let the horse run on its own so you can enjoy the scenery. That's this game in a nutshell. You're not supposed to engage in any sort of meaningful activity--just climb someplace high and take in the sights. Appreciate it like you would a beautiful painting. There's not much to play here.

""But what about the NPCs? The Korok Seeds? There're, like, 900 of them! Isn't that enough to keep you busy, you preachy bastard?""

It matters not what dungeon it is, because it's always the same design. The first thing you notice is the lack of magical atmosphere. It's very ugly and unsettling somehow. There's a big heart-shaped thing in the middle of the room, which you don't have access to yet. There's nothing to get excited about, however, since it's just a switch™, the last one in a long sequence of switch activating. Your interest is fading with each passing minute, but the real tedium is only about to begin. As you look around, a number of odd objects catch your attention, their purpose unknown. Seems like you can manipulate them with one of your powers, but doing so yields no visible results, so you decide to leave them be and explore the Beast. The layout here can get pretty confusing, and it's changing as well--the design of the dungeon is over-complicated, and it doesn't feel like you're making any progress at all. Gotta love that feeling of being **** stuck. New places bring more of the same + occasional enemies. Let's have a look at them:

Flying Cow Skull (special ability: bore you out of your mind)

Tentacle Garbaggio (SA: will touch you)

Octorobot (SA: irritation booster)

It's the same trio whichever Beast you choose to enter, and that's pretty bad to say the least.

So we're back in that same dungeon again, and things haven't changed much. The sight of all this technological **** is starting to make you feel sick. Tentacle Garbaggio is staring at you from the wall. It wants to tell you how it understands your suffering for it's been watching these walls for 100 years straight. You decide to kill it out of mercy, but now there's nobody left to spare YOU from this torture. It's almost as if a special care went into this to ensure you're slowly driven to insanity. The way you progress through the dungeon is one big mess: keep poking around until you bump into a solution. It makes you want to throw your controller through the **** Screen, i hate this game, 5/10",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Impish,27-06-2022,"One of the most overrated and deceiving games of all time.

In short, it is a sandbox game. Don't expect anything substantial, inspiring, or challenging like previous titles.

Behind its pretty pretence and large 'open world', this game is empty, vapid and an absolute trainwreck of game design... Its superficial beauty is part of its marketing ploy and mass approval.

Whilst Nintendo's push towards an open world for Zelda may be a praiseworthy change, the execution is utterly horrific. Considering the depth of dungeons, characters, stories, items and rewards in previous titles, BOTW fails on all of these fronts throughout.

There are no meaningful rewards. There is no plight or direction to the story. There are no substantial characters. Nintendo put so much effort into making the large map, the actual game is missing!

People f-around with the game physics and speed-running this game more than actually playing it.

The game is basically running around an empty sandbox: the same 3 enemy types, a stale shrine to find, and meaningless collectibles.

The fact that people praise this game is a symbol of the broken mainstream gaming industry. People don't want art, or an actually good game. They want to think that they're playing a masterpiece when actually they're lying to themselves. This game is the eptiome of an illusion of a 'great game' - pretty graphics - ""ooh you can climb!"". They've probably never played more than a sub-par game in their lives with all the vapid mobile and 'triple A' titles. Zelda is meant to represent the heart of gaming. It is meant to symbolise the creation of a game for the love of creating a game in itself...

A constricted, linear world fits Zelda because it helps to create a coherent narrative - to establish tension, to progress characters, to introduce new areas and dungeons at the right time. An open-world destroys all of this - you cannot help but play a sandbox.

People complain Skyward sword was too constrictive... BOTW prove the opposite is 10 times worse. I actually enjoying Skyward sword, but its problem is the same as BOTW - a weak story and narrative. Relationships, turmoil, sadness, fear, anger, loss, love - there are so many stories to tell - so beautiful and inspiring that bring so much life - way more than an 'open-world' gimmick. To blend the different media of game design, story-telling, sound design... That is what Zelda accomplished with Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess and Majora's Mask.

You are wasting your time if you buy BOTW. It leads to nowhere. I've personally tried modding the game after a first playthrough and it only creates a short bit of superficial excitement.

What actually made previous Zelda games meaningful in the first place? It was the fact that a clear sense of struggle was established at the outset. You come across dungeons that pull you closer to the world and characters as a result. You acquire new items and gear you have earned. Each dungeon takes time to figure out the puzzles. The difficulty is in the form of puzzle-solving and by overcoming the puzzle you are rewarded highly both by gear, story and character development. You become emotionally invested in the game, and thus it feels alive because of these game design elements.

In BOTW this is all missing. They are releasing a sequel to BOTW which I hope improves upon these elements but I doubt it. It seems games don't know how to tell stories like they used to. It is both a creative and technical feat that requires careful game design.

If you want a good Zelda game to play, pick up Twilight Princess. Despite its slow start, it has all the proper elements that make it a real masterpiece of a game. Look at indie games, look at game critiques. The mainstream scene is an absolute mess imo.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
stenly500,13-04-2017,"A lot of what needs to be said has already been said but wanted to reinforce some of the faults (mainly so that we don't see a game like this again in Zelda series).

Pros:
• Combat, for those that enjoy twitchy dodge and parry soulsborne mechanics (like me) you can basically dominate this game and it feels very rewarding.
• Graphics are beautiful. Normally don't like this sort of art style but its very suiting to the game.
• Exploration. You can climb/traverse practically anything in the game. Perilous path on your way to that tower? Stock up on stam pots and climb the mountain up instead.

Cons:
• Story and characters feel very shallow. Main story characters are very underdeveloped which leaves you wanting for more. How can you expect players to like any of the characters when you give them only 10 lines.
• Music is very underwhelming for a Zelda game
• Waiting times are ridiculous. Upgrading a piece of armor? watch cutscene. Discover shrine? Cutscene. Cooking food? cutscene. Korok seed? Cutscene. Wouldn't be complaining except you have to do it so many times it gets obnoxious.
• Everything just seem so repetitive. The 4 main dungeons are basically giant puzzles. The bosses are practically the same, shoot the eye, get in for damage, repeat with 1 or 2 minor new gimmicks. The champion stories are practically identical, there's an king and an underling, somehow related to the champions of old. It just seems lazy. Majority of side quests are your run of the mill ""fetch my sister a baked apple"" or help us kill these boars. Monsters are basically copy pasta with new skins.
• Performance. Not that we didn't already expect this given the specs on both the Switch and Wii U. It's frequent enough to actually ruin immersion (straight up freezes at certain parts).",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
neropx,03-03-2017,"I bought this on the wii U never having played a Zelda game before and being a fan of open world genre and seeing the reviews I thought why not try it. After 5 hours of play I just sat there wondering what all the fuss is about. It doesn't look great, the gameplay mechanics are very very dated and the whole character / enemies and world thing is really corny and childish. Frame rate issues are awful too, but maybe this is better on the switch. I only played the wii u version. Nevertheless this is far from a masterpiece.
I feel like this was reviewed highly with nostalgia being a powerful emotion and over taking the reviewers thinking process. I understand Zelda was highly popular back in the day and with this game not looking like much of a big jump in to the modern gaming world maybe the reviewers felt even more nostalgic playing a very similar looking game than when it was on n64, looks wise and gameplay wise. This game just isn't for me.
I will put a few more hours in to it if I can conjure up the will, but I will probably end up selling it on ebay.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Auf,24-03-2017,"An okay game, but suffers a few fatal flaws.

1. The frame-rate in towns drops to 10fps. It's bad enough to be distracting and nauseating.
2. The game is so long you'll be more than bored of it before you manage to finish.
3. A lot of the ""content"" they used to fill out the open world is low quality. Ie: pick up a rock to find a seed guy, DA NA NA NA! There are 900 seed guys. So sick of seed guys.
4. Abilities that used to be granted passively are now tied to equipment, so you must continually swap gear to navigate the world. For example, the Zora armor allows you to swim up waterfalls. Have fun navigating a clunky menu to locate the armor, equip it, swim the waterfall, then swap back to your normal armor at the top of the waterfall.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Marcheeze,24-01-2018,"Honestly as a hardcore Zelda fan who waited 4 years for Breath of the WIld, I was hugely disappointed by this game. I feel the game reaches the average players and not the zelda fans. Here are some things that I didn't like:

Characters: LINK DOESN'T HAVE A SIDEKICK! I mean Zelda speaks to him for the first few seconds but she's not that present. The champions really seem like interesting characters but we only get to see them for a short moment. No other memorable character is present. I play video games to feel less lonely but BoTW made me feel even more lonely.

Music: not good enough I played the game on mute. It didn't give me the zelda feeling I used to get when I heard midna's lament, dragon roost island theme, etc.

Main Story: EXTREMELY short and doesnt make me want to progress. The game is focused on painfully boring sidequests. (after completing 20 shrines, it isnt fun anymore)

Ennemies: same ennemies over and over and over again=annoying

The end of the story isn't fulfilling at all. I had to lay down my controller in shock when I saw the lazy ending.I couldn't believe it.

Weapons: ""Cool, another weapon that'll break in two minutes yay!""

Puzzles and dungeons: the puzzles in the dungeons were nice and innovative but then again it takes 5 minutes to complete every dungeon. the bosses are all the same.

Freedom: there is so many ways to do things that at the end anything works and this is quite dull.

95% of the time spent in the game was assigned to meaningless tasks.

NO OBJECTS!!!!!! Where is my boomerang? Where is my the special object that makes me feel cool? not here.

There is no purpose to this game. You just run around without any goals until you can defeat Ganon (which was not fun).

Riding a horse is aggravating so you have to take the long way(walking). The loading screen takes forever.

Hyrule felt emptier than ever to me. They basically placed a bunch of koroks and shrines everywhere.

I'm ashamed of this expensive game. I will now play ocarina of time until Nintendo comes with a good Zelda game (they haven't since Skyward Sword).

P.S.: I only rated 10/10 so my comment would be on top :p",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MzC_BR,04-11-2017,"One of the most frustrating experiences I’ve ever had. The game is harder as hell, and eventually get tedious with time. The exploration and combat system is punitive.

AllySky,15-04-2019,"Likely blinded by nostalgia, this game is not deserving of such a high rating, So much Zelda content that makes a Zelda game a Zelda game is missing here, and while the first couple hours were enjoyable, it later became a repetitive bore and an ultimately unrewarding game to play.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SeventhChimera,07-06-2017,"There's a 150 character minimum requirement to write this review. I can assure you that there aren't even that many different weapons/tools/monsters in the game-- take what we all know about open world games-- and you're left with repetitive monsters, the same dozen weapons more often than not.. There are only 120 shrines, all of which I've done. Trust me, if I saw a masterpiece in this game, i'd have seen it by now.

I'm going to write a 5,000 character review as to why this game is such a complete and utter disappointment-- perhaps it'll wake you all up as to how much of a let down this game really is when cross-compared to prior titles, AND no, this isn't nostalgia kicking in. Literally the only thing that carries you from start to finish in this game is the beautiful graphics, and that's not really all that impressive when we have other games out there that do it better.

What would make this game a masterpiece to me? How about a real puzzle or challenge that requires tools other than a korok leaf or a torch? How about a real dungeon? How about the need to use anything other than your primary weapon to beat a normal monster? How about a bigger bestiary canon to the series? Where are Like-Likes, Stalfos Knights, Vires, Leevers, Terrorpins, Wallmasters, Floormasters, Poes, Invisible monsters, Zombies, Flying Tiles, Electric Jellyfish (Biri), Pengators, Tektites, Armos, Dark Link (not the costume), mini-bosses in general... Why are we stuck with this flat, yet gorgeous-- open world experience with flat tideless oceans with no sharks... decorated with awesome NPCs?

More often than not you go about this big open world only running into color swaps of Lizalfos, Moblins, and Bokoblins. You know it's true when the monster shop only sells those THREE disguise masks. Having to fight the same three enemies over and over and over again is NOT fun.

NOTHING. Not a single thing about this game is challenging. There are no Helmasaurs with masks to remove, there are no Stalfos Knights that you can only kill with bombs. You can kill everything with the same crappy weapon and shields aren't even needed. So I cannot comprehend this hype summary that metacritic has put on the front page of this game. You do NOT need strategy for anything in this game. This is the most casual Zelda game, and it will never surpass Windwaker or Ocarina of Time in terms of how fun those games were. This is not Nintendo's best effort. How can you claim this game requires any strategy? It's a big DPS race. That's all it is!!! Nothing forces me to use the tool belt to kill it. Nothing forces me to use the knock down power of a korok leaf to make it vulnerable. Nothing requires specific elemental arrows to kill it either. If you think there's strategy involved just because Link is missing his dodge roll this time around, then perhaps you just need to git gud.

Where is the immersion? Where are the mini-bosses? Why is Molduga the only one aside from those Hinox mini-boss pretenders... Perhaps the most puzzling question of all... Why doesn't Lynel have a mini-boss health bar? When people compare this to much more immersive games like Skyrim, Witcher, or Dark Souls... I have to wonder if they're out of their minds, OR if we've played the same game? This barely scratches the surface as to what I expect from a 10/10 hyped up open-world game. Dare I even say, No Man's Sky does open world better. (There goes this review's credibility, but who cares, it's a fun review..)

Why is Amiibo on his Tool belt! Seriously? Get that dlc crap off of there and make a useful tool that utilizes the Joycon's HD Rumble feature. C'mon ffs. Why even put the feature in the controller if you aren't going to showcase it?! Selling this off for Arms soon.

It's almost like Nintendo went from being way innovative to being basic. What's with the repeated mural story cutscene with different text and different music depicting Ganon being sealed away? For real?! That's how we tell stories now? Pushing the same freaking cutscene ten different times with a different narrative? They couldn't be bothered making any other historical cutscenes outside of the mural one, could they? Instead we had to find memories, half of which are of Zelda whining.

Lastly, there is no meaningful mention of the Triforce. If this is a reboot of the series and a culmination of all the timelines, then they left a ton of story out and a ton of monsters. And does anyone else think its bizarre that after a hundred years and a bunch of dead hylians there are no graves around the villages? I guess dead people don't get gravestones.

Nintendo, please remaster Ocarina of Time WITH rumble support. We want to play it like we used to with the Stone of Agony all revamped to work with the HD Rumble joycon feature.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

weapons break after a few swings , even bows , making most weapons just throw away things you collect all the time because you keep running out of them , arrows cant be farmed as much as you want , arrows enemies shoot arent obtainable after a set amount , shops dont restock once you are over a certain amount

the base game is so short it can be beaten in a few hours , theres only 4 areas , which are short , instantly throw a boss in your face and then rinse and repeat until you beat them all , or you just realize you can go straight to the final boss and it wont make a difference, as you just have to fight the weak bosses there instead , but are able to skip the annoying stuff before them , the final boss himself is a joke as well , i had like 5 hearts and no good equipment when i first beat him",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ultraviper,29-11-2017,"A bit overrated. There are sooo many things in this game that seem to have no purpose other than to annoy the player. Not being able to climb in the rain. Climbing being so slow. Having to constantly change clothes when you enter different temperature zones. Having to go through so many steps to cook things. Weapons being so fragile. Inventory for weapons being so small. Lots of annoying little cutscenes. Find a shrine: cutscene. Enter a shrine: cutscene. Finish a shrine: cutscene. They're skippable after the first couple seconds, but there's 120 shrines in the game, so you'll be pressing that skip button a LOT",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
FrankJaegerr,12-03-2017,"es el el primer zelda que de verdad siento esa sensación de aventura, desde el principio te dicen que no vayas con prisas, que te prepares para lo que viene, explorar es super gratificante, y no por las recompensas que puedas obtener explorando, sino viendo lugares, santuarios, enemigos, personajes...
es un juego en el que me encanta perderme.
gráficamente es precioso, los paisajes son hermosos y saber que todo lo que ves es explorable es genial.
las mazmorras son entretenidas y no son nada frustrantes.
la historia es simple pero efectiva, también es muy enigmática, te invita a seguir sabiendo que paso hace 100 años.

AnthLC,12-03-2017,"I have to say so glad I brought the Switch console and well Zelda BOTW is a killer game. I remember playing Zelda on Nintendo 64 and back then was one of my favourite games ever. They have done it again in my opinion. I am addicted and been playing all weekend. Hours of game play still to go.

Really is sad that some users are putting negative reviews not because they played the game and like but because of a perceived bias from experts reviewers. Which I don't feel is true all game reviews have a element of bias.

More sore grapes because the hype was correct and probably the best game of the year. The game play is not for everyone. If you not into exploring games (adventure) then don't purchase the game and don't knock it if not your cup of tea.

The original Zelda game was much the same as this one, although this one is better simple because so much bigger. The element I like most about this game is what will be around the next hill or river. Usually a new part of the story and yes there is a story and it is good one.

The graphics are not on par with PS4 or Xbox, but Nintendo realised a losing battle to compete on specs. For me Nintendo has always been about game play and plenty of it. But graphics play smoothly and I don't notice any lag or problems with frame rates.

The paraglider is fantastic way of moving around and avoiding monsters if don't want to fight.

Can't wait for further Switch games with great game play.

The music is good and not annoying. You can play it on the move (portable) although looks better on big screen. Looking forward to further Switch games.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

phoreman,14-03-2017,"I am a console and PC gamer who has played many similar games and I have also played almost every zelda game. I will list my main pros and cons.

Cons: The main quest line is a little on the short side in my opinion. 4 dungeons was much less than i expected for such a vast game. The dungeons all feel similar, and to me they lack a certain unique zelda feel. This maybe for the best, however the days of finding dungeon maps, compass, key, and boss keys are over. The bosses also seem identical to me, only with different weapons.
The open world at times feels empty and pointless. The combat is fairly simple, and it seems odd to have the stamina bar not linked to attacking power. Korok seeds also seem a bit redundant after the first 100. 900 seeds? That is too many.

Another important thing to note is the voice acting in English. Although most of it is at least acceptable, but voice acting for the Gorons is absolutely terrible. I know that Nintendo has made this game accessible in 8 different languages, all which unique voice acting from different actors in each language. However they have to assume English is one of the top languages people will play the game in, so it seems odd they didnt pay more attention to detail. Especially since Zelda has been a series known for its lack of voice acting, i feel they could have done a better job introducing fans of this series to voice acting.

The combat seems hard at first, but it is far more simplified than many make it out to be. Once you have beaten the four main dungeons in the game, the additional powers granted to you make the combat much too easy. There is the lack of the classic roll that we have all loved since the early days. It may be a small detail, but the combat could definitely use another option other than backflips and side hops.
Pros: In general this is the zelda game I have hoped for since OOT. The open world is beautiful and dynamic. The exploration of the world may be the most fun part of the game, and since it is a massive world players will find countless hours of fun hidden around Hyrule. The enemy AI is incredibly well programmed. Interactions with enemies are extremely varied and can be hilarious at times. Fighting feels fresh but familiar at the same time.

Adding aspects of survival was a great reinvention of the series. Cooking is more fun that I had expected, as well as having to find new gear as your equipment breaks. Dealing with the weather changing constantly is also fascinating. Small details like music slowing down at night and speeding up as the day grows on are fantastic.

Side quests seem more important and exciting than in games such as Skyward sword. Along with shrine quests this adds a welcomed addition to the main quest line . This combined with the vast amount of weapons to collect, as well as varied armor sets that are brand new to the series.

This game rewards creativity and exploration. It greatly reinvents the Zelda series while keeping many of the things we love about this classic series. All in All i would say the changes are all for the best. This game is by far the most ambitious Zelda yet in scope and creativity. The amount of attention to detail is staggering, and it was well worth the wait in my opinion.

I only give it 9/10 because I think Nintendo can still do better. This might be a perfect game, but it feels a little too short despite the vast world.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TomClementine,14-03-2017,"The game is very good and has lived up to expectations.
The graphics are outdated though the style makes it look better that it should.
Personally I don't think that the weapon durability mechanic is great, I feel like when I'm in a fight, at the wrong moment my weapon breaks and it is very annoying.
The story is rich with lore.
The trial system is very different and rewards you.
The world map is truly open world and has a wide range of activities.
The different mounts are cool and different.
Difficulty could be challenging at times, maybe could throw younger/newer players off.

This game sucks. I’m an adult with limited time...this is too long to get going

I’m sure if I could get and find a few dungeons and add a heart or two I’d think differently but I don’t want to have to watch YouTube videos to play a game.

I’m a big Zelda fan, this is the most sweeping one to date but is a massive disappointment Give me the Link between worlds, minish cap, links awakening styles all day every day

PlatinumChaosX,21-07-2020,"I just struggled to enjoy this game. At first I really enjoyed getting to know my surroundings. But as time went on things in the open world felt more like a chore, weapons always breaking, I didn’t like the idea of having to never use my favourite weapons because they would break so easily. I didn’t like the games difficulty, I like a challenge but this game felt like I was being punished from the get go. Levelling up stamina and health felt like a chore overall and to me just isn’t fun. Collecting the heart containers on older Zelda game, that’s fun. This game doesn’t reward you for taking on the challenge. I just don’t like Breath of the Wild. It’s over hyped because it’s the first massive open world Zelda game. The games story fails to captivate me and I’ve spent hours just grinding through this gruelling harsh open world, in preparation for a story which is just taking too long to get off of the ground.

Controls: 3/5. Layout is very awkward and not intuitive. I understand there is a learning curve but they could have done a better job here. This has never been one of the Zelda series strong suits. But having said this the horse controls are not good. I understand that they want a learning curve to help with immersion but it just ends up being a drawback.
Story: 3/5. This game is targeted at a large audience so I feel bad being critical here but there is very little entertainment with the story. We have all played a zelda game and there is nothing here that stands out.
Gameplay: 3/5. Combat is clunky and has not evolved since majora's mask.

Oizoz,09-03-2017,"Honestly, i have no idea of where all this hype comes from and i think the critics are paid to give it high rating. After this i'm not gonna trust any site that gives this game 10/10.

I thought this game was gonna be something to redefine gaming after reading so many positive reviews, but boy was i wrong.

After spending 20 hours+ playing it, i still do not understand the reviews being overwhelmingly positive. Sure it gets great many things right like the wast open world that is free to be explored but so does many other games.

Probably the stupidest thing ever, is the weapons breaking after hitting something like 2 times. Great, you spent few hours finding insane weapon and decided to kill 2 birds with it and it's now totaled.

Voice acting is also pretty average and don't get me even started on the fps issues. I must have had like 10 or less fps in lost woods and many other areas.

It's pretty difficult game so that is a + and i also got somewhat addicted to it so that is why my score is relatively high, but it does not deserve 10 that is for sure.

I only made this account to warn people to not go into the hype as i did. Maybe if you have played Zelda before you will find this game enjoyable but i haven't and so i'm rating it not due it being zelda but being just a game.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

loonachan,13-01-2018,"For me, the weapon durability system kills this game. What could have been a fun and almost limitless adventure was made thoroughly not-so-fun through one central game mechanic, which is kind of an accomplishment in my mind. I shouldn't feel anxiety about exploring in an exploration game, the weapons break after only a couple enemies and at that point is just becomes tedious inventory management to get the best weapon you can. On top of that, it's weirdly unbalanced, as boomerangs are just as effective as longswords. It seems to want to take certain things from good RPGs but not put the other things in them which makes those RPGs good. You should want to change out your weapons when they become sub-optimal, not because they are constantly breaking. Enemies never drop money and stores are useless for buying anything but arrows and one set of armor. The Sheikah Slate apparently allows you to pull heavily explosive bombs out of your butt but can't do arrows? It tries to be creative and make more sense when it comes to starting fires but then is completely inconsistent and boring in another way.

Then of course there's the story and characters. Which is to say, there basically isn't any- aside from maybe the Gerudo. Sorry, but Legend of Zelda was a revolutionary game but it was also incredibly primitive, you shouldn't be emulating it in the story and characters department. They say you don't even have to care about the main story, but the vast majority of side quests are dull as dirt and the only other thing to do is the Shrines, which are probably the best part of the game but so many rely on you doing boring side quests to unlock them.

The only thing I really liked about this game is how well it does the Gerudo, which are done even better than in Ocarina of Time. Their town and society is brimming with character and charm and even genuine laughs. 100-year old turns 5 year old is also cute and funny for 5 minutes I guess, but you only visit her like twice. Lurelin Village is also nice, but there's little to do there. The Zora are done okay but there aren't many interesting main characters from there. The Gorons are okay but they're exactly the same as they were in Ocarina. The Rito in Wind Waker weren't excellent but Medley was at least cute and charming, they overhauled them so they look more like birds, which doesn't look horrible all the time, except for the Rito children who look like FNAF nightmare chickens- a far cry from Medley. Also, weren't they supposed to be evolved Zora or something? It's like Zelda was trying to make sense for a while and they gave up with this one.

All the main characters aside from the Gerudo champion are frustratingly boring, and the voice acting actually manages to subtract from them. The English voice acting is atrocious in all but a couple characters, but at least the game is merciful and lets you choose to change the voice language. Zelda's voice in particular does not fit her character at all in English, and it sounds like she's doing a bad Game of Thrones impression.

While I had some fun with the game, overall it's a very muddled and confused game that doesn't know what it wants to be. I don't begrudge the people who do like it, but here's hoping they go back to games with exploration that doesn't punish you for exploring, stories that are simple but engaging with great characters, a Link that occasionally expresses emotion, and a more proven set of game mechanics that make sense for its genre.

Also, where is the music? Even LoZ had music. It's silent with only atmospheric sounds through 90% of the game, with only a few piano notes to break up the silence. It's charming when you come upon a stable with cool pan flute but then it's back to nothing. Music in past games make me emotional just listening to them, and this game has nothing. It's somewhat fitting for my whole outlook on the game, really. Wanting to change so much it took out the best things and put in unfun things that may be ""realistic"" but are dull and tedious.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mrthrow28735,18-01-2018,"I Don't understand how a game so mediocre gets so much love. I'll start bluntly by saying that this game has more issues and problems you'll find than having fun. The auto save feature rarely happens and by rarely i mean every 40 minutes or so you'll have to manually save. That means pause the game go save menu wait a few seconds and you'll be doing that over and over. Not to mention that there are entire places that you can't even save, so if you have to leave to go somewhere or die you'll have to start over from about 40 minutes back. Patheltic. The combat is horribly broken. If you so much as touch an enemies fingernail you'll die. Why? Because **** you thats why. This game isn't hard it's just repetitive bs.

Phuz,09-11-2020,"**** in the Wild.

There are people on here rating this extra high to make up for troll reviews. They aren't even troll reviews. They're legit. This is not trying to counter balance anything. 0/10 is my honest score. I love Nintendo and Zelda. Been playing both since 1986. If you like running around a vast empty space, very slowly, collecting items and doing some beyond basic, boring puzzles with poor graphics and worse music then this is the game for you, that is practically all you do, run around an empty space. If you want the great graphics, music, gameplay, atmosphere, emotion, puzzles, bosses and dungeons synonymous with Zelda then save your money.

This isn't Zelda branching out and trying new ideas, it is just destroying what was an exceptional gaming franchise. The new ideas were all s**t. ALL. It literally brought nothing good and turned something incredibly engaging and fun that I would skip meals to carry on playing, to something I could have switched off at any time, never played again in my life and not be remotely bothered if I never saw anything BotW related again ever.

Had this been a bit of a poor game I didn't get much enjoyment out of I would have given a 3/10 but this is a poor game I was annoyed at wasting 6 hours of my life on. Virtually nothing happened other than a few fetch quests and a very annoying stamina gauge. The Skyward Sword stamina got on my nerves sometimes but this was a whole other level of unneccessary annoyance.

The whole 6 hours I persevered with it was a frustration, the climbing, the empty world that everyone raves on about being so great to explore, the temporary weapons, the lack of music, the fetch quests, the worst voice acting imaginable, the terrible dungeons (if you can call them that). Just utter rubbish. If it wasn't Zelda no-one would have given it a 10, no one would have bought it and certainly not for £50. It is simply no fun to play. Worst Zelda I've played. Do yourself a favour and get a WiiU that you can play about 14 Zelda games on, including all of the best ones made and you can even play this junk on it too should you choose. Yes the loading times and animations on the WiiU will be just as bad as the Switch, so don't worry you'll still get time to make a brew between scenes. If you want to get a Switch for Zelda BotW don't bother. Get the WiiU and proper Zelda's. Switch is great but don't buy it if just for BotW.

Whilst on the topic of WiiU. I am not the biggest fan of Xenoblade Chronicles and its weird battle system but my God, Xenoblade Chronicles X on WiiU destroys BotW on anything. The world is so much better designed. If you are going to enjoy running round an open world doing quests then the Xenoblade X world is leagues ahead of this. It is huge and beautiful and alive and has good music too.",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I'm personally not a fan of the overly large but empty map, while interesting to explore, it's frustrating to know how much of the land I've not visited, and how much time it would need for me to 100% explore the world.

Then i try to focus on the story of the game and i went in straight line on the quest. Sadly this story is so bored, no carism on main characters, even when i fought ganon i thought wow what he is going to say to me and he didnt say nothing. No story with the master sword, just need 13 hearts and u can get it. Personally im a fan of zelda saga, but this game dont deserve the score that its have. Im really dissapointed with this game and with the politics of company in general, DLCs confirmed after the collection edition? GTFO here nintendo.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Stopdumbingdown,04-01-2020,"wow
unbelievable

all i can say is that this game is clearly one of...

the most OVERRATED games of all time.

it takes a mile wide and an inch deep to even greater levels than fallout 4 and makes skyrim look like an einstein of video games

no wonder the games being put out in this day and age are perfect models of mediocrity as the sheeple flock with drool

this game can be PROVEN to be the most average of games as video games can absolutely be critiqued with facts

boring open world
laughably boring bosses that make skyrim perks look innovative
meaningless gameplay
foolish degradation system and i actually like the mechanic...when done competently
zero personality and thats saying something since its a supposed zelda game
too easy: the games fakes its difficulty at the beginning
side quest system that makes skyrim writing look ingenious

story? lol
character development? lol (and im a gameplay guy)
progression? nope

besides not even close to being a top 5 zelda game it can be proven to not even be an above average video game by objective means

good grief people

ktjayhawk77,01-01-2020,"I was very skeptic of this game at first because I generally prefer the more linear Zelda titles, and also because the game lacks good dungeons and that is my favorite part of Zelda games. This game also seems to lack a decent story and it kinda of sucks you have to collect optional memories through the land to get the full story. Boss fights were also very easy and not very memorable at all. I do like the challenge this game brings, as there hasn’t been a hard Zelda in ages.

Jerad_2142,09-03-2017,"Oh Breath of the Wild, you had so much potential, where should I start…

-The Good-
• Graphics: Although the graphics are stylized which is usually something I dislike greatly, they actually pulled it off well in Breath of the Wild, it makes for a very beautiful game.
• Wildlife: The wildlife is actually quite a bit of fun to hunt.
• Voice Acting: There is actually voice acting, not much of it, but what little there was I did like it.
• Tutorial: Tutorial was unobtrusive, which was a nice change of pace after Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword.

-The Bad-
• UI: The UI is painful at best, they tried to set up a sort of quick weapon switch menu, but it just doesn’t feel natural to use. The main UI is pretty much standard, nothing amazing but nothing super bad either.
• Weapons: Weapons break way to easy, it only makes the issues with the UI more noticeable because you have to keep opening it to assign your next weapon or shield.
• Climbing: At first I thought this was pretty sweet, you can climb almost everything, but quickly the slow climbing speed got very annoying. You can jump to speed it up but it takes huge chunks out of your stamina and once that runs out you fall back down.
• Swimming: Swimming suffers from the same issue climbing does, it’s too slow and you drown when you are out of stamina, luckily you don’t have to do it all that much.
• Horse Riding: There is just something wrong with the controls here, it’s like half the time the horse doesn’t want to turn the way you want it to go.
• Hyrule: Hyrule is massive with lots of area to explore; however, there simply isn’t much in it. It seems very empty. And in the end it ends up making the story events too spread out which quick starts making it boring.
• Music: What music? Half the time it’s just silence filled with the clanking of your equipment.
• Story: There is a little time bit of story, but it’s very tiny.
• Shrines: Oh please no… No more, the first 3 shrines were okay, I totally expected real dungeons to show up after that figuring it was just the tutorial, but alas that isn’t the case. There are just more shrines, all of which share the same interior design of the other shrines.
• History and Lore: Well, unless you count the machines that came out of nowhere there really is none.
• Performance: I had many instances where the game stuttered or ran super slow on my Wii U, beings I paid the same amount as the Switch version I’d expect it to run just as well, it did not.

In the end I didn’t really feel like this was a Zelda game, it felt more like they slapped Skyrim and Assassins Creed together and went for a very minimal story and worse climbing mechanics. The things the game did well are all done better by other games, and the things it did wrong it did horribly wrong.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
fabiomartinazz,06-03-2017,"Ok so, how should I begin?

First off, completely forget ""extremes"" scores. If the game would be a 10, it would not have so much negative reviews. The opposite is obviously true.

You check that the review score of the ""professionals"" are a way different from the user scores. So, it's the main evidence of payed reviews. It's a modern way of marketing, so we must accept and deal with it.

Now, introductions done, let's off to the point:

Zelda always had some characteristcs that went down in inheritance from the first game to the last (until now). These characteristics made fans and built up the game as we known it.

BotW broke up the main characteristics of the serie in many ways. It was a very risky and ambitious move from Nintendo (not really surprised of that move from them, by the way).

Now the game looks like much more as a survival game then the classic adventure/RPG.

That's not that bad, when you're reaching a public that like this genre of game (survival/RPG). But not all the Zelda fans could like the same concept now adopted.

That's being said, I will try to impersonate more a player and less a critic to say: I like survival like games. But, that's not the only stone on the road.

Since the game tried to secure some of his characteristics, and to not made a completely genre change, it's not a survival game in all the main concepts. For example, the game lacks the weapon/armor crafts elements (still, you can upgrade your armor, but not as a basic craft system, but as a trade). Also, the main character does not have some basic needs, like hungry or sleep. Even with the game trying to counter-balance the needs of food, with battles that almost ensure you to eat something after (or during) them. But it's a immersion breaking anyway, one of the main characteristics of a survival like genre.

One simple solution adopted by various actual developers to deal with the genres problem is the adoption of mods. The game can be completely modified so to better suits the playstyle of different kind of players. I do have a small hope for this, even it's being highly improbably to happen, since Big N delivered Mario Maker, as it's a kind of similar concept.

Another problem of the game is when the marketing sold us the idea of a Skyrim like one. When we compare a modern game with a game not that new (even being an excelent game, still for nowadays) we expect a game that would be better in almost every concept. But BotW is not better then Skyrim. So, the comparison, used by the market, was a complete bad idea.

Things that Skyrim is more than better than BotW:

1) You have a highly density map in Skyrim.
2) The dungeons are really dungeons. Not small puzzles like in BotW. And there are many. So many!
3) You have a huge variety of enemys. And not the same, with different colors by almost all the times, like in BotW.
4) Complete and rewarding questing system.
5) Access to lots of mods.
6) Character customization.
7) Lots of side quests and not only one or another like in BotW.
8) Side stories in some terms so well developed like the main story.
9) Decisions does matter. You can choose to be a good or bad guy.

Probably there should be much other points to enlist here. But I think that those are already enough to have an idea that these changes on Zelda genre/theme wasnt complete.

Also, another thing to enlist. The concept of battle system. The weapons break very, very, very faster. Even being part of the strategy, it's another immersion breaking for the game (a concept, already told, crucial for a survival game).

I think that this enlist well the bad points of the game. I'll try to not enlist in this critic the good ones, since they're already well broadcasted.

I hope for some upgrades to better suits the Zelda game for both the Zelda classic fans, as for the new genre.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Meta1234,17-03-2018,"From an until recently lifelong Nintendo fan:

This is a Zelda game but it has got its flaws. They should be mentioned and the eternal Nintendo nostalgia should be put aside because it has metaphorically become a source of sickness.

[Frame drop part of my review applies to Wii U, cannot talk about the Nintendo Switch with certainty]

Continuing with the gameplay, the one-shot game overs and the constant breaking of the weapons is another source of frustration. It even goes beyond frustration and generates anger in the player. Travelling long distances for exploring and suddenly getting one-shot is not nice. This is a first open world for Zelda and the flaws are more than visible. The balance in the open-world playing experience is not there.

Moving on to cinematics and voice-acting. Once again the experience lacks completeness. There is voice acting in some scenes but once the cinematic is over it goes back to the text boxes. Compared to a game like AC where there is voice acting even during gameplay e.g. when following an ally, Nintendo is lagging far behind in this sector.

Lastly, there is a robotic style of developing a game from the side of Nintendo. What models have we got in our inventory? this and that ok how to combine them together? ok then now use them. First make the models, then robotically dress it up with some reused storyline. Does it fit? Who cares? After creating a story timeline in Hyrule Historia probably for selling a few copies of a book, now it is scrapped just like that. The story is meshed up again.

And my final thoughts: It does not mean that a pioneer in the pixel-era of gaming should continue getting praise even for underperforming open-world modern games, just because they pioneered back in the 80s. If a game like Far Cry gets 8 points on average, when it is much more advanced in gameplay balance and cinematics and overall feeling, then Breath of the Wild is half that and can only get a 4 from my side.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The music is great, the art is great.

The writing and puzzle design are both pretty good, for a Zelda game.

There are a dozen little details and embellishments that overall add to the depth of the experience.

Then the weapon durability mechanic ruins it all. I dont like to say it but the 0 of my score reflects the 0 actual fun that I had playing this game, it was a complete waste of time and money.

All the other great steps forward and features of this game are completely wasted by the fact that everything you pick up will break practically as soon as you use it. Pick up a cool new lightning sword? Well you better not actually use it because it will just immediately fall apart. Pick up a neato frost spear? Well you dont actually have room for it in your inventory along with the lightning sword and all the trash weapons you have to rely on for 90% of the game. Want to have enough inventory space to actually hang on to the neat stuff that someone on the design team worked hard on? Well to do that you have to indulge Nintendo in their insane obsession with collecting things and go find 450 magical fairy poos. You cant even buy or sell weapons, and what this system has devolved to is forums of people sharing locations and tricks to farm the weapons they want because the game mechanic is so asinine. Its awful, so many people worked so hard and did such a good job on this game, but actually playing it is just tiresome because to actually play with the resources you want you have to look up information online which totally destroys the magic.",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Hobobo,28-12-2017,"It's alright. Very overrated, unfortunately, and that throws off the score. I've played and beaten pretty much every Zelda and BoTW, while a pretty decent game, falls behind past titles like Ocarina, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess, and A Link to The Past. Most of the open world is empty, weapons break, bosses are recycled, Temples no longer stick to the original formula (no dungeon crawling), lack of cool items which you usually obtain in temples then use throughout the world, instead the game gives you pretty much every weapon you need at the beginning of the game, the story is very watered down (I'm surprised no critics called it out on this).

Overall, I feel like the critics could have done a better job pointing out criticism, but instead glossed over most of its obvious flaws.

In this instance, the series has lost some identity in trying something new...
I really hoped for the spirit of Ocarina of time to be fully present here but its not the case at all.
Instead you have an attempt at streamlining the franchise into more comin games, Physics system, weapon breaking system. And a non linear story in a open world which does look amazing.
Its did not feel like an adventure, more like a shore.. having to consistently look for weapons, replacing weapons..etc
I missed having that reward feel when i would get my first unbreakable sword or when upgrading that sword to the master sword (not that you cant get it in this game).
The physics system is great but only when you have the right tools, which could take you a while to get if you wanted them, again not being a linear story as much means you can miss those items intirely and not have the full experience.
The world of Breath of the wild is for you to take however you want which is not super bad but not super good if you are stilll in those original Zelda state of mind.
If you welcome a different take on the zelda series then this is for you.
It is a beautiful world with great puzzles to solve which i cant fault even if most are short, its graphics are plain gorgeous and looks great on the go.
Tech wise i cant fault it as i encountered not game breaking bug, only ocasional frame rate rate drop and the odd texture pop in.

ZeldaFan16,05-03-2017,"This game makes me wish I was playing Rise of the Tomb Raider. I have played all of the major Zelda releases since Ocarina of Time and some of the mobile releases and even the gameboy classic ""Links Awakening"" and the 3DS ""A Link Between Worlds"". And I have never started playing and almost immediately thought really that's all the direction I get? Perhaps my favorite was Wii's Skyward sword with it's quirky characters and relatively fast but story rich intro sequence. And to go from that experience to what is TBOTHW is shall we say a stark contrast and not in a good way.

There is so little direction that you really can either open up the guide that you (hopefully) bought with your game or you can wander around aimlessly until you eventually stumble upon the shrine you were supposed to be looking for. This might be fine except that the world is so vast and initially lacking in any form of transit but your own feet, that it can be exceedingly boring. To make matters worse there is only one NPC, an old man to talk to and he isn't the most interesting of characters either. If you started off with a futuristic motorcycle or even a bicycle for that matter this might be moderately enjoyable but running around gets plain dreary after the first couple of hours.

Then my other qualm... this game's art style looks like a Miyazaki film and yet the voice acting cannot be changed from English to Japanese. Even though I watched the initial trailer in Japanese and was super excited as soon as I saw the English trailer and learned that the Wii U version has no way to get that Japanese audio to play (even though I am sure it must be somewhere on the disc!). Sure if you have the Switch you can set the console for Japanese and play with all the text in Japanese. The Wii U though is region locked so the only languages available are English, French, Portuguese, and Spanish. I really am considering brushing up on my French just so I can have another audio option. The story isn't so nice for those who don't have a ikkyu level Japanese Kanji fluency though as only the character dialogue comes with Furigana (phonetic notes for the 2500 characters that are likely to show-up) the menus have no phonetic guides so I image some elementary school students will also be using a dictionary with regularity.

When Nintendo said they were abandoning region locking I never thought they would still do a defacto language lock via system that doesn't allow mix and matching of languages (I will be setting the Switch to Japanese despite the inconvenience of having to look up certain Kanji with a touch dictionary when I get the switch version).

The voice acting issues don't end their because anyone who has played Zelda games knows that one of the most emotionally evocative means the series has had, while not embracing a full audio dubbed game, are the voice tags non-playable-characters use at the beginning of nearly every text based dialogue. Since all previous games have not had real spoken dialogue, every region has received the same original Japanese voice tags and thus the characterization of all characters since Ocarina of time (including Link's battle cries and other noises) have been done by a Japanese voice actor. Thus this is in effect the least Japanese Zelda game made since Ocarina of time and as such the games tone is noticeably different -- it's like Zelda's Japanese soul has been expunged and replaced with voices that don't quiet feel the same.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

kholland65,09-01-2020,"This could honestly be one of the worst games I’ve ever played. This game was probably fun for about 30min then it was all downhill from there. Had to stop playing after about 5-10hrs because it was so painfully bad. I don’t think I’ve ever not finished a game until this one.

This game is literally just a giant sandbox with 0 purpose. You can face the final boss immediately, there is no leveling system, no equipment you get to keep, there is literally 0 reason to kill or do anything in this game. Everything feels completely pointless other than just so you can mess around and kill time. The weapon breaking system where everything breaks after 3 hits has got to be the dumbest **** I’ve ever seen put into a game. Who ever came up with this idea should be shot. There is no leveling system to help you get stronger other than finding shrines for hearts which is more work that it’s worth (which is a theme in this game) so every enemy literally one shots you (again meaning there is 0 reason to even fight anything)

It’s really pretty dumbfounding how bad and flawed this game is. None of these devs should have jobs in the video game industry for approving this dumpster fire. The only idiots who like this game are Zelda fan boys, and Minecraft nerds who just want to frolick around a a sandbox with no real guiding purpose.",0,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

lgndsgn,13-04-2017,"How anyone could give Breath of the Wild less than a 9 is beyond me. It's a perfect 10 in my book. Of course there is always room for improvement, but what they have accomplished with BotW is one of the most enjoyable experiences I've ever had in gaming. I've been playing Zelda since the original NES version. If I had to compare it to previous games, I would say in light of rendering similarities, it's like a much better version of Wind Waker. The attention to detail all around is astounding, and I can see why it took such a large team and over 4 years to develop.

First off, the game does a great ode to nature with it's beautiful environments. The flowers, rain showers, lightning storms, morphing clouds and atmospheres, varying temperatures, all changing in a day to night cycle creates an amazing environment to explore in. Link (and his items) are effected by the environment, which adds to immersiveness.

The sound production is excellent. If you have a chance to play these on good speakers, you'll realize how much detail and thought went into the making of the sounds.

The ONLY thing I feel they fell somewhat short on was the English voice acting. It's not BAD, but most of it is also not very good (made it feel like a cheesy cartoon), but luckily there is very little of that in the game.

Anyways, this game is awesome, and if you don't like this game, you just don't like video games. This will go down as one of the best games ever made.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
London_Calling,02-04-2017,"A measure of how good this game is that when I knew my abilities weren't strong enough, rather than find it very frustrating (like normal), I was happy to explore for hours upon hours to build myself up. It's beautiful to look at and play. The Shrine puzzles are a good mix of tests and probably at the right level and tower climbing keeps you busy. This is an 8 (+1 for being Zelda with all that that brings along with it).",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Lycanthrope,19-11-2019,"A vacuous world with more minigames, collectibles and desperate attempts at charm than substance or fun. Plus, one of the absolute worst horse-riding mechanics I've experienced in a game yet. Even better when it's shoved into a finicky minigame.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MrFlankster,03-04-2017,"Ok, I didn't want to write a review until I completed the game... for the most part. I finished the story but looking at the map that came with the strategy guide, I haven't touched but 3% of the game. This is the first game in a LONG time that when I finished it, I was sad that it was over. Wind Waker was, until this one, was my favorite Zelda of all time. Other Zelda games have some quarks that really bother me, so no Zelda game has EVER been my favorite game of all time.

I really don't see how one can say this is boring. If you have the discovery bone and like to take an adventure just to see what is around the next corner, then this is the game for you. If you seek out all the memories, it will help you get engaged in the story even more. There are hundreds of boss fights and the combat is surprisingly deep. The music is amazing and I absolutely love the graphics.

The ONLY reason I give it a 9 is because of the frame rate issues on the switch. Not sure how it runs on the Wii U, but there are some areas where the frame rate clearly dips down to 20 FPS. So when this would happen, I would play in handheld mode. Apparently the update that came out yesterday fixes this so I'm excited to dive back in!

DukeJon,27-12-2017,"First time playing a Zelda game and now I'm several days in, I am beginning to wonder where this great game is everyone's been talking about. The world is very large, but dull and empty. Not much variety in terms of enemies. NPC characters are like something out of a game that was released 20 years ago; limited interaction and no voiceover dialogue. Link is a boring character : in other games I can completely customise my avatar, in this game I get to choose what trousers to wear and that's pretty much it. Physics is fun but inconsistent; I can chop down a huge tree but my axe swings through the supports of an archer tower without harming it. I can climb better than spider-man but I'm a baby in the water. Crafting is essentially limited to cooking only. Weapons break after two hits which means I just avoid mobs where possible, and even when I don't the battles aren't interesting. Shrines are like puzzle games you might download for free on a smartphone. Music is forgettable. Story is like something out a children's fairytale.

Yet there are so many 10/10 reviews flying about and this game is touted as not only one of the best releases this year, but possibly the best RPG of all time. I am guessing people have obviously not played Deus Ex, Mass Effect, Witcher, Fallout, Dark Souls or any of the Elder Scrolls games.

It's a good game, but no more than that. If it didn't have Zelda in the title, and wasn't carrying a new console by Nintendo, I don't think many people would have paid much attention to it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Sporge,10-04-2017,"First I want to say anyone rating this game a 0 has no sense of fair grading. There is a lot packed into this game and there is no way it is worth nothing. I am only scratching the surface of the game at this point but had enough moments of awe that I can't rate it less than a 10.

Are there flaws? Yes, I think weapon durability could have been a bit nice, or have a repair mechanism built in. It is also generally a bit bright for me in the day parts. To be honest I have experienced nothing else to give me pause, too minor to even really register.

You explore a rather large map littered with little puzzles and shrines to accomplish. Each combat is unique enough to keep it interesting for a long time. They made enemies with unique enough behaviors to change an encounter based purely on the environment. There are little details all over that make the areas charming and unique. The number of times I've thought there is no way they did X, only to be shown they did so far is enough to keep me looking for more. Climb every mountain, lift every rock, and swim out to the far reaches to see all the little effects, the uniqueness of the challenges, the terror of finding yourself in too deep, and the joy of overcoming it.

The combat system is a bit too simple imo (as expected of a 3rd person hack-n-slash), but that's compensated by the variety of tactics needed to kill different enemies, as well as stealth approaches being present.

ganoncrotch,09-04-2017,"I think it's safe to say that this is one of the best games I have ever played in the last 30 years of being a gamer... every single thing about the game works as you would think it should, the world is beautiful and almost everything in it seems to be there for a reason, there is very little empty space in the world just there for the sake of extending the size, every inch of the land seems to have been crafted over with purpose either for a story reason, extra find reason or simply to create a living world around you.

I got this and the Switch and thought... jesus... I'm paying 400e for effectively 1 game right now, and I have to say... if it was just that price for this game, It's almost worth it when you compare the amount of things to do in it, I'm just going passed the 100 hours mark and I have yet to actually go and do any of the main 4 story boss's, you can just get lost for days doing things like finding cooking recipes on walls of inns and hunting down the ingredients to make them, for no reason other than you want to find out what they are.

The game doesn't feature breadcrumbed gameplay... it doesn't hold your hand outside of the first couple of hours, it just gives you a world and says ""good luck champ"" and that's just... so freeing, the game doesn't tell you what to do, so you'll find yourself just wandering about and wanting to do everything you can.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Every task feels similar to the things you have been doing, and ultimately it starts to take on the air of filler busy work, and farming for items. What's lacking are the novel elements that each new area brought in previous games.

BouncingCzech,14-11-2019,"TLDR;
An open world desperately in search of an actual game...

I want to like BotW. I initially purchased it on the Wii U, completed it and have recently bought it again on the Switch to see if my initial opinions have it have changed. Sadly they have not.

Firstly: The open world they have built is gorgeous and it's a lot of fun to explore, riding your horse and climbing over everything in sight and then gliding down from a great height offers a kind of considered freedom very few other games can deliver.

Outside of that however the game itself is just so disappointing. Gone are the deep, themed dungeons/temples that Zelda players can pick their way through and unlock a new tool to add to their arsenal each time. These are replaced by bland micro-dungeons scattered across the world which vary in difficulty from stupidly easy to painfully frustrating.

In fact ""frustrating"" is pretty much the word that sums up a lot of this game. The combat feels clunky, the timings of basic things like blocking, parrying and dodging are never effectively communicated to the player and ultimately you end up relying on chugging dozens of pre-made potions and cooked meals in order to survive a lot of fights, rather than your own wits.

Another example: There is inclement weather, which is cool. What is not cool is the fact that when it rains surfaces become slippy and you can't climb them. So often this will leave you stranded in an area that's taken significant time to reach and you're unable to climb the 5 remaining metres while you wait for the rain to subside. There's just no need for it, in what way is that ""fun""?

Another: The weapon durability system is well documented, and you do get used to it but everything just feels impermanent, even the weapons you go through whole quest lines to get only last a few battles...

Another: Every time you upgrade a piece of equipment, expand your inventory, unlock a tower or a shrine... they game will play the same cutscene every... single... time, and some of these can't even be skipped. It is painfully repetitive.

I could go on...

I can't praise the world-building enough but ultimately it takes more than a world to make a game and much more than this to make a classic entry into a series that already has so many heavy hitters.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Every memorable moment in this game isnt scripted, everything you do you arent told to do.

This game is the embodiment of discovery and freedom.
This is an open world game done right, it begs for the player to roam it and discover it at his own pace.
I usually hate exploration in most games but I loved discovering Hyrule in Breath of The Wild.

There's very little hand holding which I think it's great. Finding a place that an NPC described to you gives you such a great sense of accomplishment.

The only real complaint I have about this game are the occasional frame-rate drops but everything else more than makes up for it.

claytastic,25-05-2017,"Breath of the Wild is the most important game Nintendo has made in a long time. It's the Switch's big launch title, and the Wii U's swan song, so they knew this game had to be good. I had some major concerns going into it, but I was still hoping to get a great game. Luckily, I got an amazing game.

This game rule is a work of art. A beautiful art style, a vast, expansive open world with so many things to see and do, almost all of which is available to you right at the start of the game, a new combat system that's confident in it's own simplicity, and new mechanics like the paraglider, the ability to climb anything, and cooking. However, there are problems. The bosses aren't that good, and the temples they're in weren't very fun to go through. Also, the weapon degradation system, while is a nice idea that forces variety and creativity, isn't executed well, especially with the Master Sword breaking and having to wait to be able to use it again (seriously, who thought of that?). Lastly, the story is passable, at best. It's way too simple and relies too heavily on lore, something only Dark Souls can pull off.

Overall, Breath of the Wild isn't the 10 everyone says it is. Does this make it overrated? Hell no. This game is incredible, and is probably still my new favourite in the series. I'd describe it as a flawed masterpiece. 9/10.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

However, as a real gamer goes, games are not all about graphics. While the game may look pretty, it's missing the core elements that made the first two Zelda games fun.

Sure, exploring, finding secret areas, and getting more heart containers are all there. However, it's more like Skyrim than its predecessors. They introduced the weapon durability system into the game, so your weapon will break after a number of swings. There is no way to repair weapon durability, at least not in a conventional manner, like in Dark Souls. So you find yourself farming weapons from enemies which detracts from playing the game. But, you can of course, buy an Amiibo and get item crates which contain weapons. This is just a huge cash grab on Nintendo's part. On top of buying the system, plus the game, plus online access if you want it, players have to spend a lot of extra money on Amiibos.

They also introduced the recipe system. Players gather food and can cook them by finding a pot and creating new food from resources gathered. This also detracts from playing the game. You have to spend time gathering resources and cooking to make dishes that restore stamina or increase movement speed. That's fine if you want to play a survival game like Ghost Recon Breakpoint. But, players like me just want to play the game and fight monsters.

This game could have been much better if they didn't focus on making food and forcing players to pay cash to overcome the weapon durability system.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

nightfox541,04-12-2017,"Gorgeous game you will have trouble putting down, This is what open world games will look to for inspiration over the next decade. The sense of exportation and discovery you will find here is near perfection. The world feels alive and is the finest version of Hyrule you will find to date. Combat, crafting, controls, puzzles all feel like they were forged with care and consideration. The world is filled with numerous memorable characters. The champions and their descendants are the stand outs. I loved that each of the champions felt like a true bad-ass of which their descendants tried to live up to. I am hoping they play a large sole in second dlc. This is your typical save the world save the princess story, but the strength of it comes from how they tell it and the great cast of characters. The use of memories give you flashbacks of the events leading up the game that make you care about the story even more.

The few complaints that I could muster were the about the boss fights (the first 4), and the handling of the games objective. The boss fights felt too easy. Once you recognize the attack patterns, you most likely won't get hit again. If they had more HP they would pose more of a challenge, lengthening the fights. The lack of direction in the game felt like its other (minor) weak point. The game tells you ""go complete these four major objectives"". That's it. If it would have given me even a pinch more I would have been satisfied. Something as simple as the region each of the four objectives were in. You can easily find yourself spending hour upon hour just exploring the world, completing shrines, doing side quests without even a thought of the main objectives until you actually come across them. I am not saying that that time is wasted by any means, but I would have liked to have been given a general direction to go in if I wanted to ""finish"" the game. That rant aside, the frame rate also dips a little low for my liking, especially when any fire is on screen.

Surma,27-05-2017,"The game has great graphics, good environment of the outside world. Great detail. Lots to discover...

But falls short in boring boss design, being kinda short in comparison to others, where the only thing making this game long is only running to get to somewhere. Suffers from framerate issues that might be fixed in coming patches, the reward from temples is impactful... perhaps a bit too much. I feel like this game needs some level of mana instead of the long cooldown of the spirit powers that you can gain to balance the power you gain, because frankly the bosses become a bit too easy to defeat once you got the cooldowns up.

Other than that it's a fun game but really wish bosses had more variety, which sinks the score.

And the ending was big disappointment, this coming from someone who's expecting epic long boss fights and great ending credits. Maybe partly because I didn't unlock all memories but still kinda felt disappointing.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

PokeMaster22222,18-12-2019,"Simply put, nowhere near as great as previous games in the series.

This game would be fantastic IF it didn't have limited stamina or weapon and shield fragility; both of these are nothing more than unnecessary hindrances and limitations that ruin various aspects of gameplay.

If your stamina gauge runs out, you're forced to wait for it to refill, which is a waste of time and not fun at all. It's especially bad when climbing, since running out means falling off and likely dying. If you manage to reach a foothold to recharge your stamina, you're stuck on that foothold until the gauge refills. The same applies to rain, by the way.

As for weapon and shield fragility, this hindrance renders combat a net negative, since you'll almost always come out with broken gear and acquiring worse equipment than what was used. In previous games, the random Bokoblin was nothing more than a second's distraction to try to get a few more Rupees or a heart, since there was no downside to slaying them on your way to a collectible or story progression. In Breath of the Wild, random enemies are to be avoided since they'll just result in broken equipment with absolutely nothing worthwhile to show for it.
Furthermore, weapon and shield fragility inherently lowers the value of high-quality loot, since it'll break all the same. Literally everything is breakable and worthless because of this stupid mechanic.

Other open-world games have done well without these hindrances - Skyrim, for example, lacks weapon/shield fragility, while Assassin's Creed lacks both. Middle-earth also lacks either hindrance. These games know that artificially limiting the player is an inherent negative. Furthermore, there's been much more compelling Legend of Zelda games too - Twilight Princess has fantastic characters, a wonderful plot, unforgettably-good dungeons, and flawless gameplay across all three releases. The Wind Waker has better combat, a more interesting Link, an actual narrative, and better dungeons. Link's Awakening has a more compelling world and characters, interesting dungeons and fun gameplay.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TMath,10-12-2017,"Its not a traditional zelda game but its still good.

The story is fine but loosely structured like many open world rpgs and its not the main feature here.
The world itself feels alive and looks amazing. its huge and extremely rewarding and fun to explore its akin to elder scrolls or witcher in its huge sandbox but focuses much more on game-play and exploration then either witcher or elder scrolls.
The exploration is amazingly fluid; The towns fit so organically into mountainsides or on a grass meadow. There is an insane amount of cohesiveness to the world and it feels great. some of the puzzles are really really creativity and interesting some are average. some are that old school zelda rock bs but all in all the puzzels and way they are implemented are amazing. the game lets you do puzzles combat and exploration YOUR way which is very refreshing.

The sword/melee combat feels like a stripped down version of wind waker or twilight pricness
yes they added weapons types like Two-Handed, Spear and Wand. But besides the wand,
weapon types barley change how you fight. buuuuuuuut
the combat is still fun and deep. i bet your asking ""what the hell how"" ""you just said it was average""?
that's only if you count pure melee. The bow in this game is the best in any version of zelda and is way more fun and useful to use. u can use your rune powers in combat and pull off some really wacky and creative stuff. you can also use your environment to your advantage...use sneak attacks...sense your weapons break you can always sacrifice a badly damaged weapon by chucking
it and ur enemies then pull out ur wand light the field on fire fly up on the updraft pull out ur bow unless a barrage of bomb arrows and land like a freaking pimp! its really encourages experimentation and creativity

You can easily dump 60-70+ hours into this game if u like exploration... 100s if you go for all the collectibles and do all the quest

i highly recommend for any zelda fan who enjoys the game play of zelda games
i recommend this to any zelda fan in general
and i also recommend this to anyone who likes open world sandboxes
if your looking for a good open world RPG id say maybe try witcher 3 or fallout new vegas",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AdamMaticGaming,13-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has been hyped up for five years, which can be a dangerous position for a game. Sometimes when a game is hyped beyond belief for so long it can fall into the trap of dipping below expectations and disappointing the player. Does Breath of the Wild fall into this trap? Hell no.
Now, before I go in-depth about this game, I would like to say that I played the game on the Nintendo Switch, so not all of this review (mostly the technical side) may not apply to you if you are playing on the Wii U. Also, there may be some mild spoilers ahead, so if you don't want any of that, well, you can see the number above this wall of text I'm currently writing for my thoughts.
Gameplay: The gameplay of BotW is top notch. It's clear that Nintendo has gone to lengths to rethink how 3D Zelda works. The movement has been completely reworked, tricks like shield surfing, climbing and paragliding completely change how you explore the world and add a sense of verticality and freedom to the world as a whole, which is great as that's exactly what the developers want you to feel. It's easy to learn and as such you never feel like you can't go somewhere, even at the beginning of the game. Combat has also been reworked, an amazing change as it's been basically stagnant since Ocarina of Time. And although it was always functional, it was never freeing. In BotW, there's always more than one way to fight the good fight. Slight stealth mechanics mesh well, and allow the smarter player to lessen the load of an upcoming fight by taking it slow. Ultimately the best way to attack enemies is to use your environment to your advantage, which keeps players on the lookout for easy ways to take baddies out. Everything about how this game plays is freeing and fun, something that 3D Zeldas have always struggled with. You can explore the world without proper direction for hours on end, which is a testament to how fun the game is on mechanics alone.
Story: The story of BotW ties back into the central theme of the game; exploring a huge world. A majority of the story is told in bite-sized chunks that the player has to actively seek out. The Idea is that Link has lost his memory and the only way to recover it is to visit the places that are saved as pictures on the Shieka Slate. Finding these places in and of itself is a difficult and rewarding task, as you often have nothing to go on other than its relative position to identifiable landmarks and a few nondescript words from a fellow traveler. But when you do find these pieces you get a cutscene showing you more of what occurred 100 years prior. These cutscenes mostly go towards developing the relationship between Zelda and Link, but as they go on you realize the sense of tension and nervousness that Hyrule is going through. Overall, though the story isn't amazing, it is delivered in a way that makes it all the more meaningful to the player. This game tells an epic tale in an interesting and new way, and it does an amazing job at making the character care about the people around them.
Audio Design: There isn't a ton to talk about here (as with most games) but what is here works well. The music is great as usual, but the sheer lack of it makes the times where it does kick in all the more emotional and overwhelming. It's not that the game is silent, as there's ambiance and faint melodies here and there as you play. I never thought about it while I played, because it isn't important. When you enter a town/shrine/dungeon/neato area music will kick in, and it does a great job at setting the tone of the area as per the usual. I think I prefer this to an overworld theme, as the sheer amount of time you spend traversing Hyrule would likely make it annoying as the game went on. The voice acting is also a nice touch, even if it only really happens in cutscenes. It can be a little cheesy at times, but it works overall. Oh and all of the fighting music (be it just some enemies, a Guardian, an overworld boss or a real boss) is phenomenal.
Graphics: This is where some people have docked points in the game, which I really don't understand. The game is breathtaking in its sheer size, and the visuals do a fantastic job at showing this to the player. Draw distance is pretty reasonable, the overall look and shape of the terrain is maintained even at distance (I never noticed texture pop in or low poly models being replaced) though effect distances on things like smoke could be a little better. It isn't terrible, and the effects look good, so meh. The graphics overall are pretty impressive and gorgeous, but the framerate is where I begin to dock points. At times the game will dip a little bit. It isn't intrusive for the most part, but in highly forested areas like Korok Woods, it consistently drops to 20 or below, which is just unacceptable as it completely takes you out of the game.

My two kids and are all playing this(each with 40+ hours so far) and it is amazing how we take completely different ways to get places and solve puzzles. My only real complain is the cooking system doesn't retain recipes that you've created and is a bit cumbersome. If you make something good and use it, then you don't have a record of what ingredients were used to make another one. No ""dungeons"", but they aren't needed in my opinion.

ConsumerBatman,26-11-2017,"(I could have sworn I already wrote a review for this game.)

It's magnificent. What else is there to say? This game is simply magnificent. Every acre of Hyrule, the grass, the seas, the sky, is alive with wonder. Every Moblin, Bokoblin, and Guardian that could be lurking over that hill keeps you cautious, yet charged with a wanderlust. Every streaking meteor through the sky begs you to postpone your current objective to pursue that pillar of light.

Every breeze and it's nature-inspired piano accompaniment makes Hyrule feel lush and alive even when you're barely interacting with it. Every glowing shrine in the distance... every beckoning mountaintop... every dense forest... every new traveler with a story to tell...

I could go on for hours. I'm over 70 hours in. I haven't discovered HALF of what there is to do in this game. I'm still regularly surprised. I've got a ways to go, and I hope for years of glorious adventures in this beautiful, breathtaking Hyrule.

Exploration, world design and art style are all second to none. I found the story to be borderline invisible however and the weapon degradation system discouraged me from using some of the cool loot i found which is completely the opposite feeling you want with loot systems.

One of the best games of the generation for sure but slightly overshadowed by Persona 5, Bloodborne and Dark souls 3 for me. Still the best thing Nintendo has made since Mario 64 which is an impressive statement in itself. Definatly worthy of the praise",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

kimitake,22-04-2018,"After I complete this game (main quest and most part of the side quests, almost 100 hours of game) I can say that has too much weak points to be considered a masterpiece, it's a good game but 97/100 is simply ridicolous. I will not gonna explain the merits this game has cause everybody has already done, but i want to focus on the problems it has.
The combat system is obsolete and light years back compared to competitors, all the weapons have just 2 move sets in total, there are just a few type of enemies mixed in colours, the puzzles in the dungeons after a while start to be repetitive and not stimulants.
I also didn't like some game design choices (this is personal maybe someone could enjoy those) like the weapons that disintegrate after a few hits (arches included) and the fact it's almost impossible to climb when it's rainy is so frustrating.
I can't understand how this game could be compared to Ocarina of time a game that is 20 years older but better in every way (except for graphics of course).
Reading the others reviews I also can't understand how almost nobody highlights the problems this game has, exalting only the good parts of it.

on the contrary it is really trite and banal.

The dungeons all offer their own unique puzzles and backstories, but the Vah Ruta Divine Beast was the most memorable. The game is also massive, in scope and in a number of achievable goals.

CicoNut,11-04-2017,"The Legend of Zelda series is known for having a fairly linear structure, with a slow start, a hand-holding sidekick and lots and lots of dungeons. However, with Breath of the Wild, Nintendo just lets you run free. No slow beginning, no hand-holding sidekicks, nothing. As soon as you step out into the world of Hyrule, you are free to do whatever you want, whether that's hunting monsters, combing the land for secrets, or following the main quest.

In the game, Link awakens from a deep sleep and a mysterious voice guides him to discover what has become of the ruined Kingdom of Hyrule. Link meets an Old Man, and learns from him that 100 years prior, a great evil known as the Calamity Ganon rose up and laid waste to Hyrule. Unable to be defeated, it was sealed within Hyrule Castle while the ruins of the land were ravaged by nature over time. Although trapped, the Calamity Ganon has grown in power, and Link must defeat it before it breaks free and destroys the world.

What pushes Breath of the Wild ahead of its competitors is the freedom it grants you. You can tackle the game's dungeons in any order you want, or just skip all the way to the final challenge from the get go. In fact, you don't have to do any of that to fully enjoy this game - you could easily spend over 100 hours finding and solving the game's 120 shrines, collecting the 900 Korok seeds, or just exploring as you please.

Breath of the Wild doesn't just excel in exploration, but also combat, which is surprisingly deep for a Zelda game. You can sneak up on enemies, snipe at them from afar, or even use the environment to your advantage (like pushing a boulder down a hill and crushing them). Taking on bokoblin camps and giant guardians is definitely a highlight of this experience.

Yet this near-perfect game is not without some flaws, the most prominent being the infamous Blood Moon, which is the game's way of re-spawning enemies onto the map. It's nice that Nintendo worked it into the games's lore, but it can be really frustrating when you've cleared an entire bokoblin camp, only for the entire thing to re-spawn right on top of you. It also triggers an entire cutscene whenever it occurs, which can take you out of the flow of whatever you're doing at that moment.

Some other minor grievances include there being no way to fix broken weapons or shields, no way of healing without opening your inventory, it rains too often (which prevents you from climbing) and the fact that it has birthed an entire fan club who are shipping Link with Prince Sidon. Seriously guys, WTF.

In short, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is what all games should aspire to be, with a beautiful art style, fun combat and an entire open world ready to be uncovered.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
thdremily,10-04-2017,"There is nothing to say that hasn't already been said about the gameplay itself. As far as the game as a whole, Breath of the Wild is a masterpiece. Hopefully it is remembered, played and replayed for generations as the 9th symphony is played today.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Gurrdin,14-12-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a fun and good game, but it is not without its flaws. It has a beautiful world with superb art and (for the most part) sound direction. Seriously, what Nintendo managed to do with the admittedly limited hardware is astounding. However, there are certain things that would just take me out of the experience. Also, let me preface this by saying I would have given the game an 7.5/10, but I'll round up since Metacritic won't let me use any decimal values.

First, I think the world is just a bit too big. I enjoyed the open world, but I felt like it would have benefited from being about 20% smaller or so. Parts of the world got a little bland and repetitive to travel throughout. Still, I did like the idea as a whole, it just needs a bit more refinement for future installments. Perhaps cut the shrines down to around 100 or slightly less and adjust the Korok Seed exchanges.

The shrines are actually something I thought became an annoyance throughout the game. They just weren't that much fun most of the time. Some had fun and clever puzzles, but others were just boring combat trials. It felt like the devs kind of put themselves in a corner with how many shrines they put out versus how many good ideas they really had. They weren't horrible, though, just annoying.

One thing I did despise, however, was the weather. I don't know if the way rain and lightning were handled was just for the sake of some realism, but it seriously took me out of the game. Climbing things to find secrets was one of the best parts of this game, and I'm not sure why the devs felt the need to mess with that. Slipping off the surface you're climbing on just isn't fun, especially if you're at a spot that is somewhat high up. Also, needing to remove metallic items during lightning is just a nuisance and adds nothing to gameplay.

The weapon degradation was frustrating. I often found myself hoarding my best weapons for fear of breaking them before a harder fight. I wish the weapons lasted longer or some of the better weapons were just a tad easier to get. This issue is somewhat alleviated by increasing your inventory space, and that isn't particularly difficult to do.

The Divine Beasts were very cool, however. Even if they were a bit easy along with the bosses, the scale and their puzzles made them fun. Plus, their locations introduced you to the fun races and some visually diverse areas. In particular, the Zora's Domain area was quite a site. The rewards for freeing the Divine Beasts were definitely worth it, too.

Still, I just felt myself getting tired of playing the game. After I freed the fourth Divine Beast, I looked at the memories I hadn't recovered, the armor I still hadn't upgraded, the Great Fairies I still hadn't found, and just decided I was done. I realized at that point I just wanted the game to be over. With that, I ran to Hyrule Castle to try and actually beat the game.

Since I mostly ran through Hyrule Castle, I can't give a fair criticism of it. However, it was visually impressive and pretty tense with the Guardians in place. The art style of Breath of the Wild led to very appealing areas, whether they were bright and clear or dark and corrupted. The art team certainly deserves a round of applause for their work on it.

At the end of the day, Breath of the Wild was a good game, but it just couldn't seem to stop getting in its own way. There were just too many annoyances that added up. If you make the world smaller, rebalance the shrines to be more varied, change the weather systems, and get rid of the rapid weapon degradation, this game would be very close to being perfect. It's still a Zelda game for sure, but it's just not the most fun Zelda game, and it really should have been.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
frederik1478,05-05-2020,I enjoyed the game very much but I must say that if you aren't in the mood for some slow play climbing game then this game is not for you,8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Quackattack78,10-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a culmination of the works and imagination by Nintendo that brings me that same feeling of adventure that Ocarina of Time did so long ago. It's a new step for the 3D Zelda line, one that strays from familiar linearity and allows the user to take the world on at their own pace.

There are many things Nintendo does right, including large scale exploration, engaging gameplay, dynamic weather, a fully interactive environment, and a physics engine that falls right into the middle of realistic and wacky. All of these elements work together to create a believable world, as well as an experience the rewards creativity while still maintaining a degree of accessibility. The game stops holding your hand soon after you activate the first Sheikah Tower.

One thing the game does exceptionally well is providing a plethora of content everywhere you go. This was very overwhelming at first, as every time I set a goal I would find myself getting distracted by Korok puzzles, Shrines, and side quests. While most of the side quests are simple, many of which can be categorized under the fetch quest umbrella, others provide unique and meaningful rewards. Shrines take the place of Pieces of Heart, and reward you with spirit orbs that can be used in sets of four to upgrade your health or stamina. The variance in mechanics the Shrines provide are a welcomed addition. Korok puzzles are plentiful as well, all of which are simple environmental puzzles that upon completion reward you with a Korok Seed, an item that is used for increasing inventory space for weapons, shields, and bows.

I have mixed feelings about the inclusion of the stamina meter, as well as weapon durability and dungeon design. The Stamina meter from Skyward Sword returns, and is used for climbing, gliding, and sprinting. For climbing and gliding, the inclusion of the meter is necessary as it helps to give a feeling a progression when upgraded. It keeps you grounded until you make a little progress so that you can take to the sky later. New heights can literally be reached once stamina is upgraded. For sprinting, however, the use of the stamina meter hinders movement, an artificial roadblock that slows my progression through the world that I find to be completely unnecessary given the size of the game's sandbox.

Durability I found to be annoying in the beginning of the game, and I wouldn't be surprised if others are put off from proceeding through the game as a result of having to find a new set of weapons after every few enemy encounters. It's arguable that this design decision was intentional; a means of forcing the player to be more creative when approaching enemies. Not everyone is creative, however, and as a result this mechanic can be disabling to those who would rather run in and channel their inner Leeroy Jenkins. As you progress, durability does become less of an issue as you acquire more powerful and durable weapons.

Dungeon design is excellent, but they are rather short and there are only 4 included in the base game, which is a shame considering some of the best puzzles in the game are included in them.

Now for the bad:
The Story: fairly weak and straight forward, a result produced by the game's openworld design. The entire time I was waiting for that ""moment"", the one that would force me to drop my jaw in awe, but it never arrived. The voice acting (in English) is bland, and many of the cast decisions the localization team made are questionable at best (looking at you, Yunobo). There are elements that are crucial to the lore of the series that are only vaguely referenced within the main quest, odd exclusions that in many respects worked against what the story was trying to convey.

Sound Design: Brilliant. Nothing is too overbearing, and everything fits in. The music, on the other hand, leaves much to be desired, especially when compared to previous entries in the series. There weren't any tracks that actually gripped my attention, not like the classic MIDI tracks such as Gerudo Valley from OoT, the Overworld Theme from TWW, and the more recent Midna's Lament from TP.

Performance: While docked, the game runs at a 900p native resolution, and a 720p native resolution while undocked. This was a poor decision by Nintendo in my opinion, and the game should have been locked to render at 720p native in both configurations. There are little to no framerate issues while undocked and running at 720p, but there is substantial inconsistency in the framerate rendering at a native 900p while docked. Probably partition errors as a result of upgrading the resolution. Hopefully this can be addressed in the future, and Nintendo provides a performance preference for those of us who prefer framerate over visual fidelity.

All in all, The Breath of the Wild provides a unique and engaging user experience. While not perfect, it is one of the most notable games Nintendo has ever developed. 8.5/10.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

TheGreatEds,08-03-2017,"This game is one of the best games i have played in years. I really loved this game and had so much fun exploring all the different areas, filled with monsters, shrines, and towers. What I liked most about this game is that it is VERY difficult, however it didn't get to the point of frustration, this was very refreshing from Nintendo since they tend to make their games easier as time passes. The combat system is also very fun, although I do have to say that the inventory of swords is very small, maybe if they didn't break so easily I would get it, but it is a bit frustrating since some times I ran out of swords when fighting a boss. The story, while a bit bland, is pretty good compared to other Zelda games. The open world also doesn't feel empty like other games *cough* *cough* and is pretty fun to explore. In conclusion, this game is great and is definitely worth the price, and this comes from a guy who doesn't like the other Zelda games.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

damienphoenix,09-03-2017,"How do you make the Legend of Zelda relevant again? By destroying the definition of what a game like the Legend of Zelda is supposed to be. Where do I start with this game? How about the fact you really go can anywhere you want- horizontally and vertically. How about the fact the physics in this game actually matter and you can truly manipulate and approach every situation differently because of it. How about adding voice acting and cutscenes and some of the best writing I have ever read in a video game?

I don't know where to begin(just like the game). I have been preparing for a hardcore open world game in Hyrule for years. I knew that eventually, Nintendo would take Zelda in this direction so I needed to prepare myself. It all started with Portal 1 and 2, then Skyrim, then the Last of Us, then the Souls series and Bloodborne. Each of the game series I listed you can see influenced the final product. From the quick, challenging and fun puzzles( just like Portal) in the shrines and dungeons. The open world discovery from Skyrim, the survival aspect and utilizing all your resources like the Last of Us, and the difficult but rewarding enemy and boss encounters like the Souls series.

It also borrows from the Ubisoft model of climbing a tower to open up a portion of the map but unlike the Ubisoft model nothing shows up on the map. You need to find and mark the locations you need to explore. I play with HUD off which helps me really learn the environment and look at the map like a true adventure. It is so refreshing to venture off into a large land mass because you see something in the horizon. I spent 4 hours last night just exploring and find new secrets that I missed in the beginning area. I am currently in the eastern part of the map and I had a feeling in my gut I needed to go back to where it all started since I had new equipment and understood the world design better. Man, I beat two Guardians, got 15 Korok seeds, finish 8 shrines and just discovered parts of the map that are wonderous.

If you want your hand to be held and everything to be easy, this game is not for you. It is not as hard as a Dark Souls or Bloodborne but you can make it that hard if you want by venturing into areas with underpowered equipment. This game has spoiled me. I can't look or play other games now if the gameplay isn't tight and the world isn't magical. I play games to lost myself and forget about the issues of my life and the world. I don't care about graphics. I want to have fun, I want a challenge. I want to use my brain as well as my skills to get through a tough area or boss. Every time I fail, I know it is because of me. Either I am rushing, not mentality ready for the fight, or overlooking an aspect of the game.

This game is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Not sure of the rankings yet but I worry for Portal 2 and FF7. That's it- go out and get it. The Wii U is the only Nintendo system I never owned. The Switch is fantastic. I do recommend a pro controller. I use the pro controller for tough fights since I need the dexterity. But I play on the handheld when I just want to explore areas with enemies I know I can beat while looking for new shrines to complete. If you don't have money for a console and one of the greatest games ever just wait till the Holidays. But if you are like me and hate cookie cutter games like Ubisoft open-world games(Rayman Legends is awesome) then please go get this game. You will not regret it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Gronxy,10-03-2017,Definitely wouldn't have bought the Switch had it not been for this game. Can't say I'm a big fan of the console but the new Zelda is phenomenal. It presents a difficulty level that hasn't been seen in Zelda in years. You definitely can't call Zelda a kids game anymore. The game doesn't hold your hand and it makes it you navigate the kingdom by yourself. No objectives. No route. It's up to you to find your way. The world is alive and interactive. The characters are lovable and quirky. It's still feels like classic Nintendo in many ways.

Forsaken87,10-03-2017,"BOTW is a really awesome game. I love the changes to the ""classic zelda formula"" which makes it really refreshing compared to the latest followup on the legend of zelda series. There is really, really a lot of things to do and explore and I expect at least 60-80 hours for my first play-through. (Neither rushing, nor doing everything possible before finishing the main quest)
I have played the game for about 50 hours now and still am far from being bored. The game IMHO is not as perfect as some reviews claim, but it is certainly the best single-player game I have played in years! The riddles are nice, some are a little bit easy. Fighting is really fun, exciting and can be really hard for the strong foes that can be found pretty much everywhere around the world. Side-quests/exploration aside the main story is most likely a bit short (like I said I'm not completely done yet) but fun for sure.
There are minor performance issues noticeable sometimes (really rare), but those did not really affect my experience with the game. It's not like stuttering annoyingly for long time or getting unplayable causing deaths.

Overall I highly recommend this game! I would not recommend to get a Switch just because of this one game (unless you are a hardcore Zelda fan and don't own a WiiU). If you are planning to get at least 3 or 4 further games for (for me it's at least Splatoon, Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros.) the money is definitely well spent.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I have not been this excited to pick the controller back up and play a game since Final Fantasy X. And I havent even touched the story line yet. I have been exploring the world and collecting Shrines (I have 50 as of right now) and everything I discover feels like an achievement in itself.

It lays the world at your feet and asks you to explore and, most importantly, to play. I've never been drawn to adventure quite as thoroughly and freely as I have in BotW. I had to actively fight against my instinct to follow the story and trust that going anywhere is perfectly okay. With so much to see, BotW might keep me entertained for years.

ok the frame rate isn't always that great (i'm playing on wii u) and it is a very different zelda game in many respects, but the way i see it they are all a bit different from the one that came before.

my experience so far (i haven't yet completed it) has been amazing! i used to play skyrim and shadow of the colossus and say ""i wish modern zelda games were abit more like this"" and some how that's what this is. the vast world that far from holds your hand and leaves you open to explore how ever you like, big bosses and mini bosses mixed with the difficulty levels they provide is almost reminiscent of a dark souls game, and the new ""dungeons"" are great, mind bending in places but rewarding and don't keep you there for days on end.

DarkZerO_AT,11-03-2017,"Just wanna give my opinions on this game
Firstly, yes i am a zelda and nintendo fanboy but i can still think normally

ok, well this is surely an amazing game, its fun, works flawlessly for the majority and looks really nice
but there are a few issues, every game has them and also this one
some of which are: animals dissapearing after they detected you ... kinda breaks the immersion for me quite a lot, weapons break way too fast most of the time, you are basically only looking for good weapons to deal with strong enemies, this shouldnt be a core aspect of the game
the fps drops are ... well, they suck, especially since nintendo said these wouldnt be happening on the switch because of the improved hardware
the missing dungeons are also ... idk ... it just feels weird to any zelda veteran and tbh, i really miss them, not saying the shrines are bad, the general idea is great, they are fun to solve and the options you have to solve them are great, its not always just one way, most shrines offer multiple ways to solve them, some can be really easily cheesed and that makes you feel especially good since you get a feeling of ""heheh i did it in a way the devs probably never thought about""
thats a part i love about this game, it gives you so much freedom in doing things the way you want to do it

ok well, i guess my review is getting a bit out of hand here but this just keeps on flowing out :P

tl;dr: its a great game, with its own flaws and issues but its def. the best zelda ever made imo, its far from being the best game ever made but its in the top spots of the best games, thats for sure",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Revalithechamp,11-04-2017,"Breath of the Wild is not a perfect game but what makes it great is that it has many great things that the flaws are overshadowed. This is coming from a longtime fan.

The four major bosses disappointed me at first but NIntendo did what they did with Majoras Mask and made it to where you could overlook that by completing sidequests and mini-dungeons. Although I do wish there were more bosses considering that the game had a long development period, but that period was spent on making Link able to interact with the environment the best way possible.

Sure the graphics might not be the best but that's a small thing since graphics don't necessarily matter. I've barely touched the story and I keep getting sidetracked by things I see in the distance and I just get the urge to check it out. It's like you'll have a goal to reach someplace but then you see some glowing light or odd structure and you're like ""ooh whats that?"" completely abandoning your original goal to discover something wonderful.

I also love the way that you can use the environment and physics to your advantage, like throwing a metal weapon towards the center of an enemy base during a lightning storm, only for the lightning to strike and fry all of the enemies at once. Or you can strike raw chu-chus with different elemental weapons to give the chu chus different effects if they're hit, making perfect booby traps!

Now the main bosses were pretty easy but those aren't the only enemies in the game. The overworld is teeming with powerful enemies that you can battle as many times as you'd like thanks to the blood moon. Once again, the game has a Majora's Mask feel to it in terms of fighting a great evil in order to save a doomed land, and you inherit the abilities of the spirits that you rescue and use them to your advantage (Revali's gale ftw). There are people discovering new secrets everyday and this game was definitely worth the wait.

Even if I feel like the game is not enough, I'm glad that DLC is coming with new map features, a new storyline, and a new dungeon. The game isn't perfect all around, but the pros overshadow the flaws by far. Even better than Ocarina of Time. I look forward to the next Zelda game made for the Switch. Great job Nintendo!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
dr0nzer,17-12-2017,"The Legend of Zelda is a franchise that resonates with a lot of gamers and is a franchise that is well recognized, is it the game that everyone says it is... game of the year... best game of 2017... well it's all down to personal interpretation and preference, all of the game systems in Breath of the Wild is not new or groundbreaking, it's systems already built and established in other franchises released over the past decade. I personally feel the success is the franchise name in this world... if this game was released under another name I do question whether it would have been as successful as it is now.
Lets start with the story, it's basic and simple... Ganon is free, ravaged the world and you need to eliminate him, it's simple and nothing has changed from this formula, as you start the game you're thrown in the world and after leaving the starting area you're in a massive sandbox, you can do whatever you like and you choose how to progress, certain areas of the maps are gated for progression, though it may seem like you can go there you can't, not without certain ""protections"" which come in the form of gear, you can tackle Ganon at any time throughout the adventure whether you wait to be fully over powered or go for the challenge very early.
The majority of the game you spend exploring the world, the shrines dotted around act as puzzles and waypoints to encourage you to explore further, giving you reasons to go that far out or out of the way to see them, the rewards are beneficial to your character and all help in the long run.
The combat system is great, anything you see in the world you can go to, physics are close to reality.. set a tree on fire.. wearing a heat blade helps in cold conditions and vice versa, it's just really well thought out.
I personally did not like the games durability system.. I get why they did it but is it fun? I don't think so, weapons breaking and having replenish them all the time can be annoying, it does add complexity to the combat and encouraging you to use other weapons but I do ask if it's really necessary.
One big grip for me is Hyrule Castle, it's such a big thing in the world and I wished they could have done more with it, it's just a place to go to kill Ganon and personally for me it doesn't have that grand feel, when compared to the master sword, it's more a symbolic thing for the final encounter.
I enjoyed the game and put around 75 hours in, I did not complete every shrine or find every Korok seed (with the latter being too much of a grind) but did the essentials before taking on the final boss.
Overall it's a solid title but it's nothing special, for me I enjoyed my time in Zelda but I wanted more depth in the story than just killing Ganon.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Conanap,12-03-2017,"The game is very different from a lot of the Zelda games yet similar at the same time. This is perhaps one of the best attempts at open world games that exist. It allows you to directly head to the final boss or actually go through the entire world to prepare yourself. At any time, however, you can decide you've explored enough, go fight the boss, then come back and continue to explore... which is really, really weird but also very awesome at the same time. However, this causes a lack of direction for players like me who enjoy very linear games. That's not to say I didn't enjoy the game, no, in fact I loved the game, but this may be considered a little bit 'too open', and personally I do.
The game does not hold your hand and only provides you with the very basic information and then set you free. I only remember being taught how to open inventory, swing my sword, use my shield, use my arrow and how to switch weapons quickly (I think quick travel as well, but through a mandatory story conversation). Everything else - figure it out. I personally don't have a problem with this - this is a return to the roots of Zelda, where there exist essentially no help (ie, Zelda 1, Zelda Link to the Past). If for whatever reason you loved the creepy owl or the fairiy buddy in OOT or MM, then you're out of luck, because nothing will annoy you every 5 seconds to ask you to listen.
Very unique to this Zelda game are gears that break (except the goron sword in OOT / MM). Your sword will break, your shield will break, your bows will break. At first this sounds really annoying, but as you play the game, you realize there are an adbundance of weapons in the world for you to pick up, and most of the times I run out of inventory space for new weapons as opposed to not having enough weapons to deal with enemies. Iventory management is not too bad as it is actually expandable, and materials do not seem to have an upper limit on how many you can carry.
Key items are still there, but is mostly replaced by a single item that allows you to use the function of multiple items. Gone is getting dungeon specific items in previous games, you now rely on what you already have to solve these problems. The dungeons are, comparatively very easy with the exception of the boss fight, and also very short. You can do them in any order, it just really depends on which area you want to explore or complete first. In addition to the four dungeons, there are a hundred and twenty shrines. Shrines are similar to mini dungeons, but the locations are not immediately apparent besides the beginning area and you must sought them out yourself. The shirnes are usually very short but at the same time very fun, and I really loved them.
Exploration is really fun but feels progressively less rewarding as you get stronger. Enemies do respawn from an in game mechanic and get stronger, but rewards don't really seem to get much better, usually some kind of weapon or just arrows. This is the way you'll discover shrines, and to be quite honest, after around 12, 13 hours of game time I started to not want to explore different places if I don't know for sure there'd be something I want from the area. That said, exploration was not exactly frustrating as the navigation system is really well thought out. You can place different stamps anywhere you want (unlimited amount) to help yourself remember what is where, and you can place around 5 - 6 pins, each differnt colored, to help you navigate in the direction of immediate objectives. These pins can either be placed from your map or soemthing akin to a telescope.
A few gripes I have with this game: electricity / shock is overpowered. Every weapon / item has a solution, but shock is just incredibly annoying as a status. You can make potions and such, but it's still really annoying. You will drop your currently equiped weapons when you get shocked, and a lot of times by the time you pick up your items you're shocked again. It also does a ridiculous amount of damange, I hope Nintendo balances this a little bit in the future.
Also, frame drops. The Switch is having trouble holding 30FPS at 900p - a really weak proposition for a console + game in 2017. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if 720p was presented as an option in docked mode, but it isn't. Frame drops were not observed in handheld mode.
Weather can be very annoying. Climbing becomes very hard when raining, and the unpredictability of the weather, even though there's a few hour forecast in game, makes some of the area just unecessarily annoying (except for the story parts that required it to be raining, that I understand). There's been cases where I had to just leave the game running of around 10, 20 minutes waiting for rain to pass since I was climbing some stuff. Rupees are also an extreme rarity in this game, but prices are really high.
In general, the game is extremely fun but can be improved in a few areas. Worth a buy.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Fossegrimn,13-03-2017,"Its hard to review this game. In many ways, its a 10/10, but it also have problems, so I can't give it that personally. I have now finished the main story, but still has hours upon hours to explore. When I first sat foot in this gorgeous world, I was in awe. Sure, the graphics are outdated, and developed for the Wii U, but the graphical style is so amazing. But in the very start aswell you encounter the first frame drop. Really, it didn't matter then, but after many hours of playing you will witness a lot of frame drop. This isn't really that of a big deal tho.

When I was finished with the tutorial area, I was totally lost. The world was so huge. And thats what I like about this game. The amazing world. There are so much to do. Everywhere. It might look empty, but its not. And you are given so many tools to explore the game.

Fast forward after beating the 4 main dungeons, I was a little let down. These dungeons was amazing, but I would much more prefer themed dungeons instead. And the bosses were uninspired and bland. And after beating hyrule castle and ganon, that was the point the game dropped in score for me. It was a really boring boss fight aswell, and ganon had a stale design. This might just be me, I completed Dark Souls 3 about 1 month before BOTW release date. And, ofc, Dark Souls bosses were amazing, and interessting. So for me, these bosses where boring. I find it funny that I liked the mini bosses that are around the world more interessting then the 5 big bosses.

And this is why I give it a 8/10. Due to uninspired bosses, frame rate issues, also, some of the main towns felt rushed compared to the others. Ones had amazing main quests, and some had non.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
yugonaraku,13-03-2017,"el juego es bueno, pero sinceramente llega un punto en donde no sale de lo mismo, le faltó mas diversidad, el tipo de control es regular, tiende a causar ciertas molestias con tan solo de haberlo jugado 3 horas. los gráficos son excelentes, el juego en si no es muy largo, es menos de lo que podría ser ocarina del tiempo.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Bradcasting,13-03-2017,"Here is my first review on Metacritic I've been a Zelda fan for a long time I first played Ocarina Time and I would say my favorite is Wind Waker for now. This game is vastly different from any other Zeldas if you don't like games that are different from their predecessors than this would either change your mind or make you disappointed. For me their are 2 main problems the frame rate and not many dungeons, but this game is damn beautiful the graphics are perfect, the score is beautiful, the combat is fun in fact I like the idea of losing weapons when your in combat because like the title you are in the WILD. The game is like a survival game such as Metal Gear Solid 3. The story is interesting the characters have a lot of personality. Like I said I don't like the frame rate it would get a 10/10 if only they fixed it. If they patch it up then I'll give it a 10/10. This is a must have for Wii U or Switch but you don't need a Switch just for this just wait.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
LordMOrion,15-09-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a phenomenal game, full of content, plot and characters. I have enjoyed the majority of the time I've spent playing this game. However there are two major problems with this game. First, unsurprisingly, is breakable weapons. It is a terrible idea, terribly implemented which really hurts this game. Secondly is the English Zelda voice acting, I'm from the UK and the voice is incredibly irritating, so much so that I've changed the voice language to Italian!",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MrDoge,25-11-2017,"One of the most stunning and replayable Zelda games of 2017. Beautiful graphics, amazing enemies,
easy-to-learn items, amazing story, interesting NPCs, astonishing voice acting, the best soundtrack since Splatoon, basically the best Zelda game of all time. Of course, there is Ocarina of Time, with a 99% rating, but it's easy to say the Zelda franchise is one of the best adventure series in video gaming history. Nintendo outdid themselves this year. It was definitely worth the wait!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ivaalo,19-03-2017,"One of the best game I've ever played! The universe, musics and atmosphere are incredible. But this game isn't without any flaw.

I'll start with negative points:

Unfortunately, it seems the open-world feature doesn't really fit with the series. Climbing isn't the most fun action you can do in an open-world! Once you complete most of the missions, you don't have a huge motivation to beat the game, since the final part is excessively hard!
What I prefer on a Zelda is to progress at the same time as the gameplay and scenario, like you have to continue the story to have a peculiar item to access a new place. Here, you can do anything since the beginning, and the story is already written, so you don't have the best motivation to progress.
Also, saying ""Nintendo is trying to bring back the root of the original game"" is a good thing at some points, like the complete freedom, but if everything was free to explore in the first Zelda game, you would be able to climb mountains, and travel over any obstacles.
I'm also disappointed the wild isn't more developed! The savage animals don't do anything, like hunting or eating.
Breakable weapons are also a thing, but I was so sure there would be a weapon seller (were you can register your current weapon to buy them again) or a smith to repair your weapon, if they're near to break.
Finally, Guardians... those enemies are the most annoying of the series, along with Miniblins in Wind Waker.

Positive points:

As I said previously, the musics are amazing! It's a new style and refreshing! Almost every important characters have a theme fitting them so well! The graphic art style is amazing, the colors of the landscape... just beautiful! The RPG style, with item collection and crafting, are also very enjoyable! The story is very cool, and what's better was to separate this game from the timeline we know, since it takes place 10 000 years after another ""futuristic"" event! Nintendo gets free of this circle of games' position in the timeline around Ocarina of Time! There are no explicit mention of the Triforce or the seven sages. Technology is also a well brought idea that doesn't ruin the magical aspect of the series!

Amazing game, assumed risks, different style, great game experience , successful challenge! Still not perfect, but very well brought to the Zelda universe!

9/10.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Akelazam,26-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a great open world game, that takes the Zelda franchise to the next level while still maintaining true to the franchise. This game is truly a work of art that combines a wonderful soundtrack with a fantastic story and beautifully artistic graphics. While the game doesn't run at the highest resolutions out there, the game performance and art style more than makes up for this.

In open world games it is often easy to become overwhelmed and lose track of what you are doing. Breath of the Wild however gives you just enough direction without forcing you down a particular path. The world designers used the negative space to there advantage to give you the feeling of a truly expansive world. There are hidden things spread across the entire map including some great mini games like bowling and golf.

The game does suffer from a few minor issues that keep me from giving it a perfect score. Chief among them is the fact that the weapons are too fragile; the UI gives no indication of the durability level of a weapon only warning you at the last second before your weapon shatters. While cooking food was initially fun it soon became a tedious task that takes away from the overall experience.

While the game is not without its flaws I still believe this game is a masterpiece and would highly recommend it to newcomers and Zelda fans alike. Nintendo has raised the bar with this game and I can't wait to get back to playing it. I look forward to the DLC releases later this year and hope that they make an already great game even better.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MarcoL81,26-03-2017,"Not since Skyrim has a game captivated me this much.

I'm a casual gamer who doesn't have an allegiance to any particular gaming company and I have to say Nintendo hit it out of the park with this gem. If it weren't for the outdated graphics, FPS issues, and lack of a Japanese voice acting option I would have given this a 10/10. I'm an Art major in University and with every ounce of my academic knowledge I label this game ""a work of art"". The freedom of choice, The beautiful scenery, The serene soundtrack, and the wonderful game play is what drives my decision to give this game such a high rating. I picked up the switch fully understanding that once i was finished this game i would sell it, but this game has changed my mind. The Switch and Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild will always have a place in my home.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
clay3232,27-03-2017,"Putting in over a hundred hours, I can say it's definitely a great game, but the game does have issues. The game play was good offering many ways to get around in the world and fight enemies, the weapon durability does however get annoying at times. While its gives you more of strategic outlook on battles it also keeps you from using some awesome weapons with you wanting to save them. I would of enjoyed the it if the weapons had better durability and weapons such as the Master Sword, Champion Weapons, and the Amiibo weapons were unbreakable since they are supposed to be special, this would of made them stand out more from the rest of the weapons. It also really made the Master Sword seem kind of weak in this game given that it's usually only 30 damage, and the beams are super weak yet it still runs out power. Climbing and paragliding, I found to be really fun, with the only issue being the very frequent rain making impossible to climb. Having gear for climbing in the rain would of been a nice easy fix, also a rewarding discovery. The inventory system is alright but could of been better, One my biggest issues with the games is the dungeons. The game four divine beasts that act as dungeons, but each one is really short and easy to beat. Looking at the maps in each beast, allowed for you to alter the dungeons, but also made it appear that there would be more going on inside these dungeons showing the whole body of the beast, but sadly that wasn't the case with each not being very big. It was definitely a departure from the great dungeon designs of previous Zelda games. The 120 shrines I found fun at first, but they start to feel repetitive with their similar ancient tech look in each shrine. The puzzles are all pretty easy, but offer a lot of creativity with solving them. Once I had a good understanding of game play and all the runes, each shrine was a cakewalk. There is also shrines where you are challenged to fight a certain type Guardian these are pretty repetitive, Overall with the shrines, I didn't think they were all that great, I would of much preferred more time spent on making actual dungeons. This world is huge compared to other Zelda's and with there only being four small dungeons it's ludicrous. I would of also enjoyed if heart pieces were collectible instead of just weapons and korok seeds being found around the world. Playing the game you want notice much new music, or old music which is disappointing given the series' history with putting out great tracks. The crafting system is pretty simple, but I kind of wish hearts were still laying around (not like food actually heals you in real life). The difficulty of the game will have you dying a lot at the beginning but as the game goes you will acquire better armor and weapons making it actually pretty easy. The Story I found pretty disappointing, with it having a lot potential that got wasted. I liked the premise of waking up a hundred years after failing, but the story was so rare and short in the game that it hardly explored. The ending of the game, I thought was also a let down with Ganon being easy to beat anti-climatic, and the scene after his defeat was dull and short compared to many other Zelda endings. There is also some awesome characters but they really don't get that much time to shine or develop, which is really frustrating. The frame rate is definitely noticeable at times and in certain areas like Kakariko and by the Great Deku tree is really bad, but it won't ruin the game for you. Voice acting was pretty meh, which is kind of disappointing given that this is Zelda's first game with voice acting. Overall it's still a great game, but with so much potential to be even better. They did a great job incorporating open world aspects and adding stuff to the formula, but at the same time they took out a lot of stuff I really loved about the Zelda series... Dungeons, story, lack of music, items such as the hook shot, etc.. I give it a 9, definitely not a 10 or masterful. Placing it with the other Zelda's I would place it as my sixth favorite which is disappointing, because above it are Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword... All of the 3D adventures before it... Still a great game though",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

lanceton,01-04-2017,"Nothing is perfect, but I can't give this game anything less than a 100 when I've rated other games 90ish.... While not perfect, this game really gives the players a tangible glimpse of what a LITERALLY FLAWLESS open world game could be like. So far I've played no game that's capable of doing this.
If this game is not 100, I don't feel any other open world game worth a score higher than 90, simple as that.

I am not a console player. I bought N64 just for Ocarina of Time, and I bought Switch (and paid unreasonably high prices due to availability) just for this, those were the 2 only consoles I bought in the past 15 years, I regret neither. In my opinion this game is even better than Ocarina of Time at its release.

There were some people got so enthusiastic about this game that they actually DDOS attacked some critics who gave this game a low score, while I don't think those were the right actions to take, I can fully understand why their rage - this game deserves that much. I don't remember when was the last time I feel that I really liked a game this much.

Play this, RIGHT NOW, I'm not a Nintendo fanboy so I don't care HOW you play it, on Switch or WiiU or SOMETHING ELSE, but if you don't play this game right now, you are simply missing out.

To explor the vast Hyrule world is very satisfactory, you can go any place you wan to, for this game doesn't any place you can't reach, there is something very impresive Link can climb in any surface this posibility save you lot of time for example in The Witcher 3 is awful arriving to a mountain and can't climb it because the game system is terrible!! you have to waste time surrounding the mountain until find a way to climb! Flying with his paraglider is amazing you can admire Hyrule in all his splendor, like all games is not perfect but his bad points doesn't affect the game experience and now with the new patch you can enjoy a better perform on combats, simply this is the best Zelda and the best game in last decade!

Kiritsuna,03-04-2017,"Before I start, I've played the game at least 24 hours, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS

Although not every NPC has a voice acting, like most open world games does, at least it has a great voice acting in the important parts.
I love the games that have logic, for example in botw, the metal equipment that attracts lightning, the hot, cold, and burning status the slippery in the mountains and every climbable thing, the normal arrows that can transform in fire arrows using something flammable, and many other things. Also, I like the story, but unless you get every memory you will not understand it, my recommendation is to find every memory first, and then go fight Ganon. (If you have troubles trying to find out where each memory is, check the picture and try to translate the text in the upper right of the photo, that will give you a hint).
How many Easter eggs, and throwbacks the game has. For example the thre dragons that you can find in the game, the ruins of famous places, and many other things.
Other thing that I found great is how realistic the horses are, and the vatiety of them, how each horse has different attributes, I can see that they've put a lot of effort in making the horses look realistic.
All the tedious thing that you have to do to complete the game 100%, collecting the 900 korok seed, or Finding all the hidden shrines, and taking a a picture of everything for example.

What I don't like that much is that there are some creatures that are much harder to kill than ganon, for example the lynels, also I don't like that much how fast weapons break, like literally, with 10 swing almost any weapon breaks, other think that id didn't like at all, like not even a little is what happens after you defeat ganon, and no, I'm not talking of going back to the entrance, I'm talking about the story after you defeat him, also, I HATE that there is no after story (yeah, I know that many games don't have one, but they could have changed that). What I would do is add an after story where you can live with the princess, or find something to revive everyone, or a mission to help build the hyrule castle back or at least see the caste cleaned and beatiful, and last but nor least, the creatures may be tough at first, but then they are to easy

Wintzy,04-04-2017,"This is hands down one of the best games i have ever played.
Zelda: Breath of the Wild sets the standards for how an open world game should be made in 2017 and it doesn't even need the raw horsepower that we now have in the more performance-oriented PCs or consoles.
The game mechanics work perfectly to create a real-world feeling and, similar to real life - if you think that something should work....it most probably will work like that (like anything out of wood can catch fire, only more durable weapons can be used for mining, you can use metal objects to electrify your foes or you can be struck by lightning if you sit near a tree etc. etc.) .
There are so many moments when, as the developers are saying - you can truly shout ""wow, i'm a freacking genius!"".
The map is huge and full of exciting things to discover. The story is not too complex indeed, but it does something really good - it sets the scene for you to understand what is happening and get immersed in the world and get you motivated to move on but it doesn't get in the way of having fun and it offers you a lot of freedom to really advance in the game at your own pace.
The art style is unique and the music contributes really well to the atmosphere. Also very important is the fact that BotW feels very satisfying when playing and you can get this satisfaction even out of short 15 minutes play sessions. But you will need a lot of these to finish the game.

My only gripes with BotW would be that the weapons break too fast but on the other hand i understand why they did this and i also never ran out of weapons so they balanced it well here. The second thing would be the lack of spoken dialogue in most of the scenes - but it's ok if this is the price to pay for having this wonderful game portable.

All in all i enjoyed every second of the almost 100 hours with it and i think this is a masterpiece.
I truly believe that it will live on as a highlight of what gaming was looking like in our times for future generations and i am sure we will continue to talk about it as the years are passing by.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
KoopaAndTheGang,10-04-2017,"I'm cross-platform gamer for over 30 years by now - and I saved many worlds and princesses. But for the first time of my life, with each hour spent in a game I am more eager to save both than in the hour before...

So far, it always was about concluding an (more or less obvious) plot - and this holds basically true for BotW. The difference is that the longer you are on your journey through Hyrule, the more miracles and surprises you see, the more you improve your skills - the more you start feeling that this world has to be protected from the bad guy. And it doesn't feel like someone tells you to do so, because otherwise everything is in deep #@!$...it simply becomes a natural desire to save Hyrule and Zelda.

Personally, I am kind of happy that it has some minor technical flaws - as there is no 11, by those it's ok to rate it a 10. And the hope survives, that in 30 years from now I will again experience something similar. This game changes how we will understand the terms 'video games' and 'open world'. For me, it is like exploring the world as a child. It remembers me of events of my past I had nearly forgotten, when the real world was open and not seen by a grown-up view.

Well, there are other opinions - and that's those users fair right. I can only state: if you haven't played it, you are missing a milestone. It's kind of having slept on a sidewalk while Neil Armstrong set his foot on the moon.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I must say I am truly in love with the charming and lovely setting the game has surrounded the player with the moment you start the game. I'm not too experienced in the Zelda lore but I've heard that the each game is like it's own story. This one, oh I must say is stunning! Visuals are really simple but work well enough to provide lively surroundings. Controls were hard to accomodate to but I imagine that's hard for everyone who is not holding a gaming controller that often. I am absolutely in love with the character design and how sweet and some what ""cute"" they look. Over all the story is portrayed in a heartwarming and lovely way witch really put me in an emotional state (I just had to watch all of the memories cutscenes).
Cooking, exploring, and figting feels solid and so extensive!
Unfortunate that the weapons don't last that much. I really like some of the sword models and it is unfortunate to part with them after asingle fight with goblin...

I thought it to be kinda funny and figured some would be using it to get 999 arrows.. I have no need for such an exploit, arrows are not as too hard to come by as i thought in the beginning of the game.

I've probably never spent more time playing one single game, especially in regular intervals. I've traversed practically all of the map and completed many of the shrines. Now, I'm not the biggest Zelda fan but I've recently gotten more into the series since receiving A Link Between Worlds as a gift a couple years back and while I would say i am thoroughly enjoying this one, I would definitely not consider it the greatest game ever made. It is, one of the only open world games ive played, next to GTA III and Vice City and Final Fantasy XIV. I found Final Fantasy XIV to be extremely beautiful but alas the combat system and overall MMO experience were not for me so I did not play it for very long.

BotW however, has quite a bit of longevity. The sense of discovery and the depth of exploration is I am assuming, unparalleled to any similar type of game, be it RPG or otherwise. I had started to play Skyrim and I found it to be quite amazing yet I am rather biased in terms of art style and I could not get into the seriousness of the graphics. Granted, I was once quite a Kingdom Hearts fan, but I've gotten a few of the side entries in the series to finish and I feel these titles are enough to satisfy me for the series and I won't be paying mind to KH III (after countless delay). Now, back to the point, I prefer more whimsical games indeed which is why I have grown more fondly towards the Zelda franchise. The Legend Of Zelda has a fantastical lore to it which echoes many great older video games and fairy tales such as LOTR, a kind of story absolutely essential to the world of video games.

The music in this game is wonderful. As I have the game resting as I write this, the theme from Korok Forest is playing.. I enjoy its practicality yet obvious charm, which is what I will say about most of this game. Just from what I know of a few of the previous titles, TLoZ is possibly one of THEE irreplaceable fantasy IPs of video games, next to the likes of Final Fantasy. That being said, I'm more akin to some smaller fantasy titles, many of them of the 16 bit era yet when considering the entire span of gaming, I agree with TLoZ as being one of the most celebrated and rightly so although i do not consider the 3D entries to be more important than the 2D or top down entries. i did not grow up with Ocarina Of Time and Majoras Mask, I agree with their importance but I do not consider such to be the greatest games of all time.

One of the main ""cons"" of this game is, of course the framerate issues in which during the more graphical intensive moments, there is a bit of lagging/frame dropping going on, which I find to be disappointing. I bought this game along with the Nintendo Switch at launch and while I find this game would be quite sweet on the Wii U also, a percentage of the hype is owed to the release of the new game console. To be frank, I am having a tough time coming up with other detractors that would garner this game a lower score. I could compare it to other games i found to be most amazing, I suppose that is what some people do when they review or rate a video game, but i find no need to do that, as the experiences and charm of a specific game I feel should remain specific to that game.. and the criteria of rating the enjoyment of a game is received upon having sense from playing all sorts of games.

This is a Legend of Zelda game, and a decent one. Nothing too fanatical or over the top, a general fairy tale and a good Nintendo game. Could be game of the year, i cant really say. I do not play TOO MANY ""AAA"" titles so I am not in the business of getting GAME OF THE YEAR fever. I think one of my favorite aspects of this game is that it is on the Switch and that I can play it on the go, which i find myself doing much more often than I had expected. And of course, the sense of exploration.. I enjoy the map throughly, the puzzles are quite nice. The enemies were, I thought to be, a little too hard in the beginning but after trekking the entire map and completing lots of shrines, nothing is TOO hard, especially the divine beast quests. I will be competing all quests relatively soon and at least nearing 100% completion this summer. Very good game, essential playing for practically anyone.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
The_Albatross,07-04-2017,"I've never really been one to pour over a Zelda game before, although I've played roughly 5-7 of the games. Breath of the Wild is a different breed, compelling you to explore every nook and cranny of its beautiful and vast world. The enemies you'll face are all intriguing, and the puzzles in the game are intuitive. I've never had this much fun with a game. Each session I spend with it feels extremely rewarding. Any complaints I have are so small that they aren't worth mentioning. Phenomenal game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Bengaltiger,10-04-2017,"Breath of The Wild is a masterpiece.

In todays age of gaming where games explain everything about the controls, the mechanics and the activities of the world, Breath of the Wild is a welcome edition. Whereas in most other open world games you are told exactly where you need to go, who you need to talk to and what you need to do, in Breath of The Wild you are given clues about these things, and it's up to you to do it. You are given the tools to succeed, but you are on your own from there. The game does not hold you hand, and instead lets you try out things for yourself and and learn through discovery - and it's brilliant!

Another way in which Breath of The Wild deviates from the crowd is how powerful Link is. For instance, in Skyrim (don't get me wrong, i love Skyrim to death) you play as Dovahkiin, a powerful dragon slayer with godlike powers. YOU have control over the world. In Breath of The Wild, you are at the mercy of the world. Link may be the hero of legend, but he's still just a hylian. It started raining when you were climbing up a mountain so now it's too slippery? Tough luck. You can't control the weather, you just have to wait. You can't just rush in and hack and expect to hack and slash your way through everything - you need to think, you need to prepare, and you need to learn. The fact that the odds are so heavily stacked against you may discourage some people. In my opinion, this makes it all the more satisfying when you overcome them. It feels like a true adventure.

There are so many other things I would like to talk about, but I'll leave that to the professionals. I recommend reading some of the critics' reviews, and i urge you to try out this game. It is a must play.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

peck324,08-04-2017,"Here's my review of Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild and the Nintendo Switch (Spoiler):
Story: The story give a good explanation for both Zelda fans and people who are new to the Zelda franchise, there are some remembrances that are related to the N64 version. The acting for Zelda is a little bland to me as she doesn't give much emotion to the character knowing that she acts like a lone wolf but overall a damsel in distress for Link. The player can play the whole story from getting 12 memory fragments, the four divine beast, to defeating Ganon or the player can just go straight to Ganon without the other two after completing the first four shrines and beat the game, which gave a good idea whether to fully complete the game or not. Facing Ganon is fun but difficult since he has 6 forms to beat him on. Elements: Wind, Water, Fire, Lightning, all combined and Beast form. Ganon's design is creepy even doesn't show himself in human/human pig form.
Gameplay: Much like Dark Souls since your weapons have their own stamina (In which I don't like) since there aren't many weapons around when defeating bosses, but the player must prepare themselves when facing bosses. The frenzy strike after successfully performing a dodge from an attack is the best advantage during a combat zone. The player has many opportunities in the open world whether be just climbing the highest mountain in the area and just paraglide to the next area, find a horse and gallop through or just run on foot and face many items, side quest, shrines and monsters that are in the players path. Adding weather in the game is difficult and dangerous, for the cold Link takes damage in staying the area for too long, when climbing during the rain Link slips from them which takes part of the players stamina bar, and too dangerous to go outside when a thunderstorm is brewing. So much activity in that open world that this game will take 30+ hours to get 100%.
The Nintendo Switch: The Switch is Nintendo's savior having being sold all over the world with a good promising games coming this and next year, the player can play at home, play it on the tablet (Since the tablet is the console itself) and runs a 8 hour battery or open its stand and play the joy-controller with each hand but it comes with a controller model as well, so attaching it the joy-controller is like playing with an actual controller. On first day launch it had a syncing problem on the the left joy-controller but they already patched up and its now good as new. Hopefully they'll have other colors for the switch besides blue and red. If the player is not comfortable with them there's always the pro controller in which I recommend since I use it more often.
Conclusion: The story is interesting, gameplay is much like Dark Souls, elements in the game is difficult and dangerous to be part of the open world and the Nintendo Switch is a great console to have. This game is worth playing and to kill the time until more games come out (Mario Oddesy, Xenoblade 2, etc.) if you don't have the switch, well there's always the Wii U version, no difference between them so that's good news.
Final Verdict:
9/10 for Both Zelda and The Switch - The game has much more detail in the game especially in its open world, it reminds me of Horizon when exploring.
Buy or Not Buy - Buy. Besides Bomberman and 1, 2, Switch Zelda is the only game that is out on the Switch. But for the Wii U there are many other games now these days.
Rent - No. If the player manages to get 100% in less than 30+ hours.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The music is just as good as any other Zelda game, but for the first time in series history, the Piano is one of the main instruments. This works very well for this game's peaceful aesthetics.
I have spent more than 120 hours exploring the vast open world of Zelda, and just recently finished the last of this game's 4 challenging and fun dungeons. I can conclude that this game is an absolute must have for anyone who owns a Switch or Wii U.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

So much contents that Nintendo had put in open world unlike other open world games where you got half contents or repetitive things to do or less things to see or short in term of replay-ability etc... so this game is masterpiece and best open world game since GTA V is the fact.

Well done to Nintendo. Best Zelda in the series too. :)

Look forward to Mario Kart 8 Deluxe this month then Arms coming later this Spring with next month's Ultra Street Fighter II: The Final Challengers then Splatoon 2 coming this Summer then Super Mario Odyssey, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Fire Emblem Warriors, Skyrim remastered and more follow ups releasing later this year. Switch going be epic year with PS4 for their awesome exclusive line-ups in 2017 this year.

Anyway I love how much gameplay in this game you go out there anytime you want and find quests or do quests whenever you want, brilliant combat gameplay, frame rate drops in and out runs smooth, visuals is beautiful so did artwork too, storytelling so beautiful and I admit I were closet to Princess Zelda when she crying and hugs with Link during story cutscene it were make me felt like crying well that due to upset scene it is how affect my emotional follow their storytelling (not tell you what happens or storytelling since I avoid spoilers for you all because want you all find out when play this game), unbelievable you climbing anywhere you want with cooling down system due to Link getting weak and tired when climbing long way it is bit like realistic life that your body need stop and rest if climbing too much since your body get tiresome and losing system in body. Best game ever made. I am deaf too and love games but this game is best one of all-time beats every games in history since GTA V and beats GTA V to me so GTA V is now 2nd top best games in history. :)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Cyberpunk1980,13-04-2017,"8/10
This is a beautiful, enjoyable open world game which indeed does surpass other titans in the genre in artistic design, mechanics, and the like as the 10/10 critics have pointed out. It is addictive, engaging, and enthralling at times. I was glued to my couch for a month until I finished the main storyline today. It does indeed feel like a Zelda game, while being a big departure from past titles in many ways, namely becoming a full-fledged RPG. I enjoyed it immensely and it will go down as a top fifteen personal favorite. So why not 10/10 like other reviewers. Why will I focus my review on negative points mainly? Well, for one, reviewers have already accentuated the positives, at times to the point of embellishment. Secondly, there are a few elephants in the room most don’t want to notice. These are diminished presence of “dungeons” or “levels”, poor musical score, meager and repetitive beastiary, and technical limitations.
I can’t help thinking of what a missed opportunity there was for this game and for Nintendo. They designed a beautiful open world, perhaps the best ever, so why not create more dungeons/levels with more elaborate design in to the story and experience? I can only imagine how satisfying the main story and overall experience would have been there been more layers than just four divine beasts (shrines are not levels). Zelda has (with exceptions) always had levels separate from the main overworld, but these levels should be a highlight of the experience. And here they weren’t. They were brief and unfulfilling. Indeed, when I discovered the four divine beasts were all I needed (or didn’t need) to tackle Hyrule Castle and Ganon, it was a massive letdown. When I completed one of the divine beasts the disappointment was palpable. Perhaps another set of levels could have revealed themselves in the story after the four divine beasts were conquered. My theory is that Nintendo intended for more levels/dungeons. But either budget constraints or time became an issue, with the release of the Switch imperative to the company’s continuity. Secondly, the lack of music throughout much of the game was being lauded by critics as a strength, however I disagree. Video games, like films, can use music to set tones, build suspense, inspire the player/viewer, move emotions, and create lasting memories of the game for years to come. The sound design was great, and some of the music was stellar for short periods, but overall it was shallow and absent through too much of the journey. A Link to the Past invokes musical memories for me as this game never will. Another issue lie in diversity of enemies. I found that the number of beasts encountered was FAR too small for such an expansive area. Once you armor yourself up and learn fighting mechanics, the enemies become easy and repetitive, and much too easy to avoid. There are a few exceptions, such as the Lynels, but these can be conquered fairly easily later in the game with the right defense. Some popular reviewers commended the quality of the enemies in this game, but I must ask those reviewers, have they played a Dark Souls game? (I draw a comparison because they are both RPGS) Finally, and perhaps the biggest elephant in the room, is the technical limitations of the hardware and how it affected the game. If you have played current generation RPGs on a PC with NVIDIA hardware at high settings, or even RPGs on a PS4, Zelda looks to be a full generation behind. The game is still absolutely beautiful to behold, but frame rates and level of detail do not compare to other highly rated modern RPGs. The draw distances were poor, towns were small and sparsely populated, the open world was fairly empty, and graphical details were not up to par with contemporaries. Some will take issue with this criticism---“games are about gameplay, artistic design, etc.”, which I agree with in part. But the greatest games have pushed the envelope technically, which this game did not. I don’t believe this game was groundbreaking as some reviewers have stated, but has taken familiar gameplay elements and designs to higher levels.
Despite my criticisms, I am happy and relieved that BOTW turned out as it did. I was expecting a failure, as I did not expect the Open World to be so satisfying and to make up for many of its shortcomings. I hope the success of this game, and hopefully of the Nintendo Switch (I don’t foresee this), will put some cash in the coffers of Nintendo so they can once again become a competitor in the technical arena, and that the next Zelda game will be a true innovator, as Ocarina of Time and Mario 64 were when they were released. But history has told us that Nintendo’s financial success (The original Wii) has not let them close the gap on their competitors technically. However, the fingers of this ex-Nintendo fanboy remained firmly crossed.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Arma15,12-04-2017,"In general, it is amazingly big and with thousands of things to do, good graphics (for the poor nintendo graphics) the only let downs for me (compared to how great the game is are nearly nothing) is that the prizes after completing certain missions which are complicated seem completely random, the game is too open without proper rewards for achieving milestones, you're just the same if you do them or not, it should be like Banjo Kazooie, Spyro or other games that you need to collect certain number of things to proceed in the game as in the beginning when you had to collect the first 4 orbs, after that you can achieve ganon right away skipping dozens of hours of gameplay. The 4 big bosses are the same (but ganon) just re-colored with different weapons and when you complete the game you're left with a ""Meh"" experience where you had expected more, you can complete the game without visiting many shrines and not even recovering all of your memories, even none of them.

The game does drop frames from time to time but the world is just all encompassing. You get lost in the universe and want to do nothing but explore, everything draws you in. The combat is thrilling and is both simplistic in its controls but complex in strategy. The puzzles are fantastic. The final boss was a bit too easy.

Joe10231,15-04-2017,"I have been waiting for this game for four years, and it lives up to the hype. The open world and it's mechanics are new and interesting thanks to the games physics engine. Sometimes when I solved a puzzle in an odd way I would ask myself ""was I supposed to do that?"". The graphics, while not realistic still manage to look beautiful, you can look as realistic as you want but without good art direction your game is going to look awful. However some of the textures are a bit low-quality. Frame rate on the other hand is a mixed bag, however the game has been patched and It runs at a stable 30fps 99% of the time. The puzzles aren't just stuck to dungeons anymore, they are everywhere. Thanks to links new abilities, everything is a puzzle! Getting around is a puzzle, cooking is a puzzle, even approaching enemies is a puzzle. More on that in a bit. Alongside the general brain-teasers of getting around there are 120 Shrines and 4 dungeons. The shrines are bite-size mini-dungeons, usually taking less that 10 minutes to complete. At the end of a shire you are awarded a spirit orb, gather four off theses and you can upgrade either your hearts or your stamina, hearts will give you wore health and stamina will make movement easier. The dungeons on the other hand are a bit lacklustre, there are four of them and they all have the same objective. Activate five hidden terminals and then fight a boss. While the mechanics are intriguing, the look of the dungeons are all the same. Now onto the combat, which has received a major overhaul. Gone is the simple stabbing and rolling of other games. Now you really have to think about how you approach you enemies. Is there a puddle near them? Fire a shock arrow at it to electrocute them. Are the on the edge of a cliff? Sneak up on them with a bomb and knock them off. Stealth is now also an option. Even the regular stabby combat has changed. Instead of being stuck with a sword, you can now find a variety of weapons to collect and utilise. Spears, Axes, Clubs, Soup Ladles, you name it. They all handle differently as well. However a bit more variety in the actual weapons themselves would have been nice, they are most ____ Sword or ____ Axe. Something along the lines of RNG would have gone a long way. In a game as open as this, it surprises me that dual wielding is not an option. The soundtrack in the game is very minimalist, usually just a few notes here and their while exploring the world. However this approach somewhat extends to all the other music. Even the boss theme is kinda boring. Not to say the soundtrack is bad, there are some great songs (the champion themes being a highlight) but it's not heard very often and it's nothing along the lines of the switch presentation trailer. My biggest disappointment is the story. There's just so many things they could have done. There's little to no character development, and many of them go underutilised. For the sake of remaining spoiler free, I will not go into specifics.

Overall, Breath of the Wild is a bold new step. Not just for Zelda but for open world games in general. In an age where huge worlds are a dime a dozen, Nintendo has made something truly special which shall influence games for years to come. However it's flaws cannot be overlooked. The mixed performance at launch, the sub-par story and soundtrack prevent it from being a 10/10.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

StevenGreen,30-05-2017,"This game is everything I loved about Wind Waker, but extrapolated into quite the feat. The size and maneuverability of Breath of the Wild is unmatched, and all open world, exploration style games from here on out are going to attempt to allow you to climb anything as this game does so masterfully. It seems like a small thing, but it really opens the game up, to a truly ""open"" level, and allows you to get creative with your gameplay, rather than hindered in any way. The puzzles and dungeons are exciting and interesting, and the use of powers with the Sheikah Slate adds multiple angles to solve each puzzle. I have never lost myself in a game like I have this one, and the only other games I have played for 100+ hours and then wanted to start over and do it again came out of Bethesda, and even those seem like they will need a major overhaul going forward to hit what this game did (and with almost zero bugs and glitches I might add). I do wish the dungeons were a little bigger and had more to them, but the castle itself seems like a mega dungeon to me that satiated that need. Also, the bosses and enemies were semi-bland, as it is just variations on a handful of monsters. The mechanic of having your weapon break was obnoxious at times, and I wish at least the mega weapons (Master Sword, etc.) were unbreakable, but alas they did not have that be the case even though for me I would even be willing to work harder to attain those items if they didn't ever break. The exclusion of a fishing pole in this game astounds me, but obviously if that's a complaint then this game must be pretty amazing in all the other categories. Anyone who is a Nintendo fan in general, even if you've never played a Zelda game, will most definitely find enjoyment here. And especially with the over-saturation of open world games, this is one of the few must play's in that genre. Nintendo adds a level of polish to games that I never thought could be done in a fully open world setting, but here we are, and is it ever exciting.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Dubeau,26-08-2017,"BOW is a great open world RPG. The world is huge and can be intimidating. The map offers directions but let you choose where to go, what to do. I like combat in general, cooking, buying a house and items. Making upgrades. The story is fun and the voices over are amazing. The music is quite good and the sounds are just perfect. However it is not an easy game. It can be very frustrating when you get in an area too strong for you. Certain shrine puzzles are very easy, others plainly annoying. Some of them rely on the Gyro gimmick (I skipped all of them). Most extra powers like magnetism-freeze and such are fun. But the photograph stuff is something I totally disliked. The radar is a hit and miss. You can mark your map with a series of icons. Getting a horse and keeping him alive isn't fun at all...it's not especially interesting and I find it boring. So I did the entire game on foot, in the air and teleport. Of all the region, the Gerudo desert region was the most frustrating and difficult. Not because of the NPC and story, but it has a knack for killing you. It still a great RPG in my book and you want to do all the small things in the game. But it's not perfect...like any games of this scope it has annoyances, some poor choices of gameplay...It should be noted that fighting ennemies gives you items, but no experience at all. I kind of found that it was useless to fight everything after a while, since there was very little point in doing so. I give it a 85%",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

agentken,17-12-2017,"First 5 hours this game is supper awesome. After 20 hours, the game is overrated. Later 50+ the game is majestic cannot stop playing (dont want to spoil anyone, try it by yourself). After 130 hrs : 2 divine beasts gone, decided to purchase DLC (Master of trial) . Now become a stronger Link in master mode for 20 hrs, gonna defeat all the 4 power up divine beast, the master mind Ganon and bring back peace to Hyrule. (Updated after playing 300 hrs, this game is amazing. Highly recommend dont want to leave Hyrue > <

Pro: ingenious puzzle (create a lot of yureka moment), new weapon durability system, addicted innovative game-play (i would like to climb the real mountain as a hobby right now) still not as good as MGS5 Phantom pain's, the seamless and immersive hyrule but still not immersive as The Witcher 3,

Con: -The combat system is not as good as dark soul's but the mechanic is very tight still better than the Witcher 3' s, the Story is not as good as the Witcher 3 as i am 34 years old married man, the generic monster 's art style in the field look dumb not intimidating and secrecy like the guardian.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Michael_Stars_5,14-07-2017,"In the first second of Breath Of The Wild, I felt excitement, just the idea of experiencing what I had been waiting for almost 3 years, and by the end, I just wanted more. Breath Of The Wild is hands down one of the greatest achievements in video game history. Every goddamn pixel in this game shows beauty and style, every character expresses emotions that you could only feel in the real world, the entire map of Hyrule is gigantic, huge, beautiful. You could get lost in the first minute of playing freely in the fields, riding horses, or even cooking! This is a game for everyone, a game so perfectly designed, acted, and presented that leaves you in awe, wanting even more, which you can get thanks to a huge number of side quests, puzzles and activities you can engage in. I cannot express with human words what I've witnessed during my play sessions of Breath Of The Wild, the three words that can define this absolute masterpiece are beauty, freedom, and revolutionary. The problem is, I think those words aren't enough to show how amazingly Nintendo has knocked the ball out of the park, just play it, and come thank me later.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The game is a masterpiece, and the genius behind all the physics and mechanics is mind blowing, The game has no limits and its the first time in a play through of any game that i feel like i'm the one in control of my own experience.

There are many complaints about the pixels but seriously, ocarina of time is the most popular game on this website and look at those pixels.

BluesBrothers,24-07-2017,"There was a crazy amount of stuff I wanted to put out there and that I just plain love about the game, so If you want something shorter, just skip to the end paragraph.

Having just completed all main story adventures, a hand-full of side quests, and around 30-40 shrines , I can safely say that the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild completely blew my expectations out of the water. I can occasionally over-hype a game to the point of ending up disappointed. However, this game, no matter how much I hyped it up, gave me a sense of adventure, wonder, and excitement every time I booted it up. I always wanted to see what was behind the next corner, or on top of the tallest mountain. There is a stroke of intensity whenever you approach even the smallest of enemies, because you know if you handle it the wrong way, you'll end up with Link on the ground and GAME OVER covering the screen in blood red letters. Right from the start, you find that this game is truly as it says, Open World. After you complete the four shrines on The Great Plateau, You have several different options to choose from in terms of story. I chose the more linear route, and it didn't necessarily make my experience linear, it just made it so the story had more substance. The heart container situation in this game is that there are over one hundred shrines. Complete a shrine, and you receive a spirit orb. Four spirit orbs, and you can choose between a heart container or a stamina vessel. A heart container increases the amount of health link has, and a stamina vessel increases the amount of energy he has (the more energy he has the farther he can sprint/swim/ without stopping. another thing about shrines are the different abilities Link has because of the Sheikah Slate, Link's version of an iPad throughout the course of the adventure. He has powers such as creating ice blocks from water sources, becoming a magnet, taking pictures, etc. and are a lot of fun to goof around and solve puzzles with. This game's controls play very smoothly, a refreshing change of pace from other Zelda entries, and easy to get the hang of. And Despite Link being a loner through this game, there's still a lovable cast of heartwarming and hilarious characters that will make you want to keep playing on. All the side quests are a blast to play through, and are filled with originality. Ranging from touching and personal to hilarious and wacky, I felt more of a desire to play through the side quests. You ,of course , can ride horses in this game and you can either just pick up wild horses and drop them off somewhere or take a wild horse and find a stable to register it under their care. All the classic Zelda locales are back with exciting new twists such as Zora's Domain, Death Mountain, and hey, The Rito are back!

Overall, this is a fantastic game with a high-stakes story and a sense of adventure pulled of better than the majority of other games on the market. And the reasons to replay it are more than just nostalgia, because you can play it any way you want to. This is definitely one of if not my favorite game of all time, and I highly recommend picking it up, for Switch or WiiU.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Joosie2300,03-08-2017,"An utterly fantastic game, a masterpiece! The world is huge and filled with tons of cool locations to visit, quests to do, puzzles to solve and things to collect. Even after spending 150 hours with the game, I am definitely not done yet! I still spend loads of time exploring areas I haven't visited yet, and I find more sidequests to do. The shrines are a cool mechanic to upgrade your hearts or stamina, and though not all shrines are as challenging as other ones, lots of shrines are very original and full of challenging and interesting puzzles to solve. The world is huge, and there are tons of interesting and fun places to visit and explore. I love that the game can be serious and dramatic, but also very lighthearted and funny. The game is very expansive. There are tons of different weapons, materials, and items to find and collect. The weapons do indeed break rather quickly, but that is very well balanced with the amount of weapons you can find. You can take weapons from any enemy you pass by, so the weapons should not stay to long so that you cannot simply collect all overpowered weapons in the game. If it isn't exploring, collecting or doing quests, there are still lots of cool survival elements in the game. You can hunt and shoot down technically any animal in the game and it will give you meat to cook (except for horses). You can pluck apples and other fruits all over the world, mix them with meat, some mushrooms and maybe a flower with a special effect, and you can cook yourself a delicious meal. There are lots of different meals, like Steamed Meat, Simmered Fruit, etc, but also the more recognisable ones, like Apple Pie, or Nutcake. You can spend lots of hours experimenting with cooking. You can tame different kinds of horses and you can even try to ride animals like deer, bears or goats. The game always looks beautiful. That word doesn't really describe it. it looks gorgeous! The stunning landscapes are always stunningly beautiful. The graphics of the game, in relation to the beautiful landscapes, aren't that amazing, but they aren't ugly either. As for the soundtrack, a lot of people point out that the soundtrack is bad and basically just some random notes, but that only really counts for the overworld music. The overworld music is, indeed, very quiet, slow, and ''random'' notes, but it is very well thought through. It is very relaxing and quiet, almost like meditation music, which fits very well to the theme of the game. It immerses better into nature, it is a song of nature, and it fits very well with the world. The rest of the soundtrack contains lots of good songs, with strong melodies that can get stuck in your head for ages, like the Guardian Stalker Battle Theme and all of the Champions' themes. The storytelling of the game isn't very good, but that is mostly because the happenings in the game do not really have a story. That is not a negative point, the game is primarily focused on the backstory, what happened in the past, which I think is very interesting.
Fantastic, wonderful, amazing, splendiferous game! Game of the year, in my opinion. Best game I've ever played, to be honest! The game includes lots of exploring, beautiful soundtrack, great characters, and lots and lots things to do! 10/10, and it totally deserves that!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Refreshment,13-08-2020,"It'll be relly hard to describe the experience i had with Zelda: Breath of the wild with words... But i'll do my best. My expectations were really high due to the delays it had for the nintendo Wii U, However, they were surpassed by far... I could write about this game for decades after playing it for more than 350 hours, but i'll try to focus on the most important things it brings to the videogames industry.
First of all, Breath of the wild has the best open world i've ever seen in my life, it's not only overwhelming... What does this Hyrule special from any other map of any other game is the level of detail and interaction you can find in practicaly everything. In addition, there's a great variety of differents eviroments and cool spots to visit and there will be always something you've missed.
If i had to describe with one word this game, i'd use ""freedom"". You can get to any part of the map when you want, as you want. You feel like there are no limits.
You'll never be bored playing Breath of the wild, you got plenty of side missions to do and around 100 short dungeons to explore. For not to mention the big amount of enemy shelters you'll have to face to steal their treasures and weapons.
The graphics are stunning, it's incredible that such a piece of art could be played on the way... It's true that the max resolution it can get are the 900p, but believe me when i say that you don't even notice.
Unfortunately, this game is not perfect... Now, i'll continue my review with the few negative things i found.
It's true that it is a copletely new and fresh vision of The Legnd of Zelda, and they dis a great job. However i miss some things from the previous games like big dungeos, a better built story, and a closer look at its characters.
What i found the most annoying part of this game is the difficulty. It is veeeery easy. After the first hours of gameplay you'll be enough equipped to get to the most parts of the map with almost no effort. The bosses seem to be a joke...
To sum up: in spite of it's not a perfect game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is in my view the best game of this generation.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

P0T4T0_AIM,03-07-2018,"I was never a fan of Zelda, or most Nintendo games before I played Breath of the Wild on my Switch. When I bought my Switch, Breath of the Wild was the first game got for it, and gosh was it worth it. I'd played a couple of open-world games before, like Just Cause 2 & 3, but nothing of the size and detail of Breath of the Wild.

When you first start the introduction to the game, took me a good hour or two to complete, the game tells you everything you need to know that's in the game. If you haven't unlocked something yet, it at least signals that there is something there that can be used. After the introduction, you get to set out into the Breath of the Wild world and are free to play as you please. You can follow some guides given to you to help you progress the story, but you really don't have to.

The unique and beautiful art style of Breath of the Wild is so awesome to see and it makes the game look so much more inviting and fun.

Tsuki_,06-08-2019,"Let me preface this by saying I am no Zelda fan. In fact, Breath of the Wild is the first Zelda game I've played to completion. As you can tell by my score, I was very disappointed, as I bought this game wishing to give it a 10/10 score, though was met with numerous disappointments and clear faults that led me to think otherwise.
First of all, the story is practically non-existent. Being a non-linear game, you're given a dump of exposition at the start to set it all up and then you're good to go. There are some sprinkled bits of story here and there but never a proper narrative. The characters have no development whatsoever, making all of them feel very bland and generic (apart from, maybe, Zelda). Both the story and characters are designed this way due to the story being non-linear, but that is such a half-assed excuse for having such a **** narrative structure.
The graphics look amazing and are right up my alley, definitely the main reason why I bought the game and was not disappointed. Performance was OK, though fps feels insufficient sometimes, not an expert in that area though. Music is sub-par and gets boring very fast.
Mechanically, this game feels very generic in terms of combat. It does improves upon certain ""staple"" mechanics for third person games, but you don't really need to know them to beat the game. In fact, I played most of the game without knowing they existed. Also, durability system is dumb and irritating, having a weapon break (pretty much) out of nowhere totally pulls me out of combat immersion every time, and it feels terrible.
Difficulty-wise, it's very straight-forward as long as you know what your doing. Walking mindlessly will get you one-shotted, but following the (very unsubtle) directions the game gives you, you'll be all right. The dungeons are extremely easy, and the boss fights feels like it was made for 4-year-olds. Shrines can be harder, but don't feel related to the story in any way. It makes no sense to have the story-related dungeons to be easy and shrines to not be, shouldn't it be the other way around? Also, to top it all off, this game has 0 enemy variety, not even joking.
Overall, if you are the kind of person that buys a 60 dollar game to wander around a shallow world doing shrines and being a cartographer, this is the game for you. I'm not that kind of person, so I'll pass.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Once you buy the game, I believe you will agree to me. To those who gave negative score, I am quite sure they raged because the game is too hard... Since this is a open world game, I think it makes sense for putting some extremely dangerous monsters in some places. This will increase the curiosity of the players. But if you attempt to fight them, get ready to die. If you are not ready, then train yourself up! I saw a lot of player rage on this game and gave a bad score on this because he cannot defeat a monster. This made me upset because this game's loading screen already told you that if you struggle on fighting some kind of monster, train yourself up.

ZacFry,20-11-2017,"Breath of the Wild is yet another series-turned-RPG game that has some of the best exploration aspects ever put into a video game. The score is great, and the mechanics are innovative, but the game is deeply let down by a lackluster plot and world. The game is always verging on boring, as the entire map is an empty sandbox with hardly any characters, and the story is nonexistent. Despite these major flaws, BotW ranks up there with the best of the series.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Obviamente no es perfecto por ejemplo el jefe final no es lo suficientemente épico para terminar esta gran aventura pero por el otro lado los pocos errores que hay, en vez de estropearte la partida te parecen graciosos y los quieres ver para reírte. Morir no es frustrante (a no ser que no hayas guardado la partida en 30 minutos ¡pero eso es imposible por el auto guardado!) las armas son lo suficientemente durareras para que no te quejes de que aguantan poco, pero lo suficientemente blandas para que no las cojas cariño. Y sin duda lo mejor de todo es que en 250 horas de juego aun tengo mucho por descubrir.

999,06-12-2017,"This game takes everything that made other Zelda games fun and concentrates it. While some of the other Zelda games have left me wondering ""Do I like the game, or just the story of the game"", Breath of the Wild gives you a breath of fresh air, leaving the player to enjoy the game only as much as they want to. It's a game whose entire directive is for the player to explore their curiosity, giving you plenty of vectors for that. Exploring the vast expanse of a post apocalyptic Hyrule I found myself on far more than 1 occasion wondering ""what's at the top of this"" or ""what's down here"" only to be surprised by and gifted with a korok seed, ancient ruins, a hotspring in the middle of some wintery mountains, or a beautiful sight of hyrule. This is a game that uses towers to unlock map locations, however the beauty of its implementation is that you neither have to get the towers nor do you have to get them in order. Not only this, but while finding most of the towers isn't difficult, actually getting to them and climbing up them is another one of the game's challenges, with each tower having its own unique setup.

And despite the time I've spent running around in this implementation of hyrule, 150 hours in fact, plus having watched several of my friends play for hours, I know there's many things I haven't found, seen, or noticed in the game. Breath of the Wild breathes new life into The Legend of Zelda, as well as the open world game genre and action rpgs as a whole.

In fact the best part is that Link may not have his classic green Tunic, but you can get other tunics from other versions of Link. OoT, TP, SS, WW, ALbW, Even weapons from that era, The Biggoron Sword, The Sword of the Sages, The Twilight Bow, and The Goddess Sword, Weird, I thought that was the Master Sword.

Allercon,28-10-2021,"I’m making my way through the game, so I will update my impressions along the way.
Initial impressions were great and I felt myself getting immersed into the world. After many hours into the game, it’s turned into a bit of a grind and bloated with having to scout for shrines to just be able to hold ones own in combat.
It’s why I don’t like the Assassins Creed games, and I was disappointed that this follows similar tropes.
The puzzles can be great but get tedious and overly familiar fast.
I enjoy the exploration aspect as it reminds of Death Stranding funnily enough.
I came to the party late in getting around to the is title and I had high hopes for it given it’s many many praises. Whilst it definitely has its charm, other games of this genre are crucified for similar tropes.
I’ve platinumed the first two dark souls games and Bloodbourne and I find this combat far more gruelling and cheap at times.

Hwl,16-02-2018,"Well, First of all, if youre a Zelda fan, go buy this game. You will love it, and it will suck all your nostalgy out in seconds. But if youre an demander costumer, youll see that BOTW is not what everybody says, this is not a game of the year. You have probably heard that this game is difficult and does not treat you like a child. FALSE. This game is NOT difficult, this game uses artificial difficulty. EVERYTHING KILLS YOU BY 1 HIT. Till you have a better armour and tons of health. When your stats are comparable to the mons stats EVERYTHING gets so easy. So, this way the game offers you a false sensation of getting better and a false evolution as a player. The game has just 4 type of relevant enemies, that are the same on all the map, on each zone you will bore of just finding bokoblins, moblins and things like that. The game still being childish, the bosses are ridicously easy and the game does not present a single real challengue all the way throught. I'ts true that you have total liberty of solving whichever kind of situation by your own way, but BOTW gets sickly repetitive till you go defeat ganon (who is a real dissappointing boss). The puzzles that you'll find on the sanctuaries will always be or stupidly easy or ridicously incomprehensible. Whenever you need to heal you up you'll have to pause the game and go to your inventory. This constantly gets you off from the expirience and reminds you that it is just a game, and youre almost always able to save your game so you never are on real danger, because if you die, you just have to load your last save and try again. This game rewards bad players instead of good players because if you fail, just try again, but this time you know what you gotta do. The legend of zelda still being a good game, but is truly disapponting if you were expecting all the ratings promised to you.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

You can improve the armor get better weapons or ride a motorcycle but once you finish the game and all the missions you realize that you wasted more time in getting an item than in the game itself.

Alsethe2nd,15-07-2018,"This game is Amazing! I know a lot of people will not see this review but if you have somehow got a switch and do not own this game... what are you doing! At first the game brings you in with a quick tutorial Island, but it doesn't feel like a tutorial once you are out of the shrine of Resurrection, the game lets you explore, but as soon as you do something new an icon comes up that tells you how to do something with that item other than that the game mechanics are shown through NPC, sometimes talking to them will teach a new move like parry. This is great in my opinion as it means when you are playing the game again you aren't bothered by a long tutorial stage which really adds to the replay ability. Although some say otherwise, the music in this game is really incredible, it gives a great sense of atmosphere which you need in a game, as soon as you hear the guardian music you heart starts bumping, you need to defend yourself, or when you're in a stable the calm music allows you to relax the game lets you know you're safe. The variety provided by this big open world lets you replay the whole game over and over and still find new things, it also gives the players multiple choices, you could either run straight to the final boss, free the divine beast then beat the final boss or just never beat the final boss, its up to the player which makes this game really special. There is a surprisingly large variety of enemies with the lynels being my favourite as they are challenging, and give the player a sense of power, like they could defeat anything once you've beaten them. My only nit-pick with the game is the unsatisfying ending which I will not spoil but the boss fight is quite underwhelming and although challenging for a player who doesn't really know the controls is easier than a lynel for any seasoned player. But the sheer extent of variety and re-play ability is enough to make this one of my favourite games of all time.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SplitMind,27-03-2022,"I missed out on BOTW when it first released, and I think that's where the real problem lies. It is not over 5 years later and the game has not aged well compared to what we have in 2022. I am hot off the heels of completing Elden Ring, so I should have expected this. Still, there are elements of BOTW that deserve criticism even in 2017.

The graphics are a strange one. Simplistic and charming, they are also challenged by performance issues and when confronted by a huge landscape, simplistic graphics can backfire, which it does here.

The gameplay of BOTW is unfortunately aged and superseded by many other games. It seems Nintendo have tried to capitalise on the open-world trend, but the end result is BOTW playing like a hastily-patched together mixture of games like Skyrim, Witcher and Horizon.

One of the earliest missions involved marking four shrines on my map, however it was not made clear that the goal of the mission was to travel and complete the shrines - there was no prompt to move the mission along organically. I looked this up online and many others faced the same dilemma, which tells me it is very bad game design to have such ambiguity.

The most frustrating aspect of this game is just how slow everything is. It takes forever to travel. I see a horse is added eventually but this is really needed from the beginning and fatigued me quickly. The stamina bar is a ludicrous design choice also, making Link the most physically unfit protagonist I've seen.

BOTW loves to tout itself as open-world, but this is more like an empty world than an open world. It would have been much more enjoyable for me had it been compressed so that there was less banal running and backtracking.

The story of BOTW plays a minor role and at this point needs a serious shake up. It's as lazy as Mario with the whole princess and bad guy concepts.

Overall, this is not the masterpiece it's made out to be. I don't even find it to be a quality open-world game of its time when it was released the same year as Horizon Zero Dawn and two years after The Witcher 3. Avoid.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DiamondShadows9,27-06-2018,"This game is great. It is really fun and even if you don't like Zelda you can probably still have fun with this amazing game.

The addition of a couple really frustrating mechanics, such as your weapons constantly breaking, and an incredibly lackluster story almost push this game into ""suck"" territory. Yet I found I couldn't put this game down. There's just something so addictive about the way this game has been designed.

MistofIga,08-07-2018,"I've had this game less than 2 weeks but have already sunk a lot of hours into it. While I don't think it deserves a perfect 10/10, it is certainly a highly polished labour of love. The only reason I decided to give a review (and such a high one at that) is because, after completing dozens of shrines and powering up my heart pieces amd stamina wheel, I finally entered my first Divine Beast (Ruta the elephant) and it all started to make sense. The shrines were teaching me the exact type of lateral thinking I would need to survive and thrive in this world. There was such a satisfying feeling of progression.
And there were a few other things that pleasantly surprised me. At first I was also irritated like many others with the weapons breaking. But it added a level of difficulty that I think the game might have needed to prevent it from being too easy. I now hope this feature appears more often in 3rd person open world games with melee combat! (but maybe with a little longer shelf life for the weapons if I'm being honest).
I also like the freedom of deciding how I'll tackle Ganon. Too many games are hand holdy nowadays and this game gave me a very warm return to console gaming. If you own a Wii U or Switch this game is a no brainer purchase. Get it!",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Smay,11-07-2018,"Now now I love this game with all my heart but the thing that stops it from being perfect is the story. Now I have gotten all 12 memories and I still haven't learned much about the champions such as mipha,revali,urbosa and the goron but I forgot his name. I would of loved to have learned more about the characters and at the end what really annoys me is how all Zelda asks you do you really remember me, but that's my own opinion. This game has amazing music, absolutely beautiful graphics/stunning visuals. I love how all 120 shrines (plus 4 with the dlc) are all unique in their own way, to were even the tests of strength are different since one you have to go behind stone pillars and a different one you have to use cryoris or magnesis.The game is so fun you don't notice how much the developers put into this game unless you've finished every shrine done all 900 korok puzzles gotten all the memories and all the side quests. You can even surf with your Shield! I personally love the combat since you can use so many different arrows there are 3 different types of weapons one handed, spears and two handed weapons which each having different charged attacks.To wrap this up the experience I had with this game was amazing and my favorite game of 2017.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

IlCyborg,16-07-2018,"Not the perfect game,but very close. The story is refreshing an feels new compared to classic Zelda games.

Helios980,17-07-2018,"It`s really awe-inspiring how good this game is. Breath of the Wild`s modus operandi is using simple tools to accomplish tasks, and boy, does it work. The revolutionary engine allows for players to create their own creative solutions to puzzles, and the game gives the player the tools necessary to really explore the massive world. Breath of the Wild`s Hyrule is so vast that it truly deserves the title of ""nearly infinite"". The size of the world isn`t the only thing Breath of the Wild has going for it, though; the puzzles are stimulating, the combat is thrilling (and allows for innovation on the part of the player), the art style is gorgeous, and the voice acting is spotless. Without a doubt, this is the best singleplayer game I have ever played, and possibly will ever play.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AdaptiveTech,08-02-2020,"Most encounters are painfully contrived, with enemies literally standing on kegs of explosives, or conveniently loitering beneath boulders. It's spoon-fed to the point of being patronizing.

Speaking of combat, I have yet to see a more bizarre control layout -- but you can't customize anything except the jump button. Link is slow and unresponsive. Collision boxes are wildly different than the visuals, especially with circular attacks.

Overall game pacing is slow and tedious. Traveling across the open world isn't inspiring or interesting, it's a matter of constantly scavenging for the next weapon after your gear breaks. You can scrounge for cooking materials, but places to use them are relatively few and far between.

Basically, if you want a game that's the exact opposite of Skyrim or Dark Souls, this is your best bet.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Detorded,01-08-2018,"This game is an absolute masterpiece. I don't need to tell you to buy this game if you have a Switch, because chances are you already have. However if for some absurd reason you own a Switch and don't have this game, you may find this review helpful. This is by far the most ambitious game Nintendo has ever created in my opinion. I was never into Zelda games before this, however this game is so vastly different than its predecessors that you don't need to be a Zelda fan to enjoy it. I'd place this game closer to an Elder Scrolls title than an actual Zelda game. At its core, this game strives on exploration. The map is gigantic and diverse, as each section of the map covers a different kind of climate region. You can scale tall and snowy mountains, to a blazing hot volcano, to peaceful forests and even harsh deserts. It is certainly difficult to get bored while sightseeing throughout Hyrule. The main story is very flexible as you can take it at your own pace and do it in whichever order you want, the side quests aren't as amazing as everything else as they are mainly mere fetch quests, however there are a few of them which still find a way to engage the player. For example, this game relies heavily on puzzles. If you dislike puzzles in games, you're in for a rough patch. Almost every dungeon consists of puzzles (whether that be extremely easy ones or more challenging ones). This game certainly doesn't hold back, and once you leave the Great Plateau (starting area) you're practically on your own. You can be one-shot by enemies and your low stamina can either drown you or send you falling off a mountain. You are on your own in the wild and you need to rely on pure skill to progress and become stronger. While the main story is incredibly fun in regards to the four divine beasts, the overall plot falls a bit short. It's not that interesting and there are many other games that top it if you're looking for a good story. However I think the developers knew BOTW's core wasn't aligned with story, but exploration and freedom; I can tell you they nailed it. There are other minor flaws with this game but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives. This is currently the best game on the Switch.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Yay_Von,09-08-2018,"I just can't believe how good of a game it is. I had to think a lot to find something to criticize about this game.

I'm a really nice guy (ahem* who isn't racist ahem*) so instead of a 0, ill give ya a 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
superpyro296,21-06-2022,"C'est assez difficile de rédiger une critique pour ce jeu étant donné que j'ai adoré beaucoup d'aspects de celui-ci mais en même temps j'en ai détesté beaucoup d'autres....au point ou j'ai pris la décision de ne pas le terminer...

Je tiens à préciser que cette critique représente avant tout mon opinion personnelle et il est possible qu'effectivement, le jeu soit très bon mais juste pas pour moi ou que je n'ai pas su comment l'apprécier à sa juste valeur. Toutefois, je tente de faire cette critique avec le plus d'objectivité possible.

Plus jeune, j'avais joué à Wind Waker et Twilight Princess et j'avais adoré mes expériences avec ces jeux de l'ère Game Cube. En grandissant, j'ai préféré par la suite la Xbox 360 et ensuite la PS4. J'ai joué à vraiment beaucoup de jeux incluant plusieurs Open World. Si je compare Breath of the Wild aux autres jeux que j'ai joués, je ne vois pas comment je pourrais lui donner 9 ou 10 sur 10. J'hésitais entre 7 et 8 en fait....mais je n'ai pas eu le goût de terminer le jeu donc j'ai mis un 7.

Qu'est-ce qui fait que je n'ai pas terminé ce jeu ? Je dirais que c'est surtout l'impression de ne pas progresser. J'ai trouvé la mécanique du jeu légèrement déficiente (ce n'est pas tant agréable d'explorer le monde, de grimper...et surtout de se battre avec des armes qui brisent si facilement). D'ailleurs, il y a très peu d'incitatifs pour combattre les ennemis ou ramasser des armes rares. Dans les jeux passés de Zelda, les donjons représentaient une très grande force à mon avis. Ici, j'ai été extrêmement déçu par les bêtes divines. Je n'ai pas du tout aimé les puzzles de celles-ci....Côté graphique, je n'ai pas trop aimé maintenant que je me suis habitué à des graphismes plus avancés...

Sinon, le jeu a assez beaucoup de positif et se démarque de beaucoup de jeux Open World de cette génération. J'ai trouvé le monde très organique et je n'ai jamais eu l'impression de remplir un checklist de tâches à faire comme on peut voir dans certains jeux. J'ai aussi particulièrement aimé comment le fait d'aller dans un village devenait une mission en soi (le processus pour se rendre aux bêtes divines était plus intéressant que les bêtes divines comme telles). Le tutoriel de départ était aussi très bien fait (l'un des meilleurs que j'ai vus).

Sur papier, le jeu semble avoir beaucoup de points forts et il est possible que mes attentes étaient trop fortes mais en y jouant, il y a plusieurs jours dans lesquels je me demandais: « Ai-je vraiment du plaisir ?». Le jeu est loin d'être mauvais mais pas assez bon pour que j'y investisse 100 heures (j'ai déjà mis un peu plus de 50 heures)

Ceux qui disent que le jeu est mauvais, ne les croyez pas. Ceux qui disent que c'est extraordinaire, ils ont peut-être raison mais ça ne veut pas dire que le jeu est fait pour vous. Voici ce que je conseillerais aux gens pour davantage apprécier le jeu (en apprenant de mes erreurs):
1. Prenez vraiment votre temps. Préparez vous mentalement à vous consacrer seulement à ce jeu. Ne pensez pas aux autres jeux qui attendent dans votre backlog
2. Profitez au max de la flexibilité de la Switch (jouez parfois avec votre télévision et parfois en version portable)
3. Ne voyez pas Breath of the Wild comme un jeu d'action mais davantage comme un jeu de survie. Gardez en tête que Link est assez faible et équipez vous le + possible en ingrédients, arcs, flèches et recettes avant d'explorer de nouveaux lieux.
4. Apprenez à tolérer que vous n'arrivez pas à compléter certains sanctuaires. Essayez d'y revenir plus tard (parfois, je passais trop de temps à essayer de résoudre certains puzzles)
5. Utilisez le cheval (j'ai perdu trop de temps à tout faire à pied)
6. N'ayez pas trop d'attentes et ne comparez pas aux autres Zelda
7. Il n'est pas nécessaire de tuer tous les ennemis. Si vous le faites, utiliser vos outils comme les bombes
8. N'ayez pas peur d'être créatif. Amusez-vous ! (de mon côté, j'étais trop orienté vers des objectifs et par la nécessité d'accomplir)",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

You could have a 45 Attack Royal Greatsword, and have it absolutely E X P L O D E D by a Lynel greatsword with 90+. Yeah, I 100%’ed it, so you can’t say anything about me not playing it.

CheeseKnight64,11-11-2018,"Let me preface this review by stating that i thought this game had it's merits and can be a fun experience at times. I truly believe that the next game in the series will be groundbreaking and that BOTW has huge potential, that being said i find the gushing praise this game has received to be completely unfounded, as such i'm going to primarily be covering the issues i found with the game and how they deduct from the overall experience. I'm going to be breaking my grievances down into 4 categories: story, world, character progression and gameplay verity.
Lets start then shall we, breath of the wilds story is incredibly linear, as a newcomer to the series i was surprised by how such a generic fantasy story of (save the girl, defeat the bady) could captivate so many, you follow link as he explores the world, meeting uninteresting characters, adventuring from area to area solving it's respective problem until moving onto the next zone. it doesn't go any deeper than this, with the main villain feeling removed with little to no story elements apart from residing in a menacing castle acting as a final destination. Main quests have poor moment to moment writing and lack an overall polish and scale, with side-quests being nothing but glorified fetch quests seen in many MMO's. Now to the world, it feels empty barren and repetitive, this may have been the intention, but it doesn't change the fact there is a distinct lack of settlements with most areas within a zone feeling similar to the next and devoid of life, not much to say on this topic but in general the game world is slightly bellow average, this is made worse by the game's primary focus being a sandbox. Character progression, again very lacking if not non-existent, link has no progression, he plays the part of the silent protagonist, iv'e seen people defend this as the player being supposed to project themselves on link, but to me it feels like a lack of work and writing, especially when in comparison to other game of the year winners, comparing geralt to link is a futile effort, the writing quality is just day and night. Now to undoubtedly the longest section of my review, gameplay verity. Lets start with shrines, you better like puzzles, because shrines are all but a requirement and with 120 of them using the same assets textures and music, those hours can certainly feel like a chore. Combat verity, this is also lacking, little enemy variation, with only a few types across the game, i'm surprised at the lack of overall criticism on this, the recent god of war was hammered for reusing a few mini bosses, Zelda is far worse with almost every enemy encounter feeling the same and very lacklustre, the weapon durability definitely plays a part in this, the gameplay loop especially at early levels includes a lot of pausing combat (not what you want to be doing to engage a player) to cycle through weapons after one breaks after a few swings, i'm not going to be going too in-depth on this because it's been covered enough, but in my opinion it's a real detriment to the gameplay. Movement verity, this is also lacking, climbing is immensely tedious, not helped by the fact it rains almost all the time inhibiting the player from actually getting anywhere, it involves staring at a blank wall for several minutes until reaching the stop of a cliff or mountain to only travel to the next vertical wall and repeat the process, needless to say this is not the most engaging task and can be completely mind-numbing. People have heralded this ""clime anywhere"" system as groundbreaking, but it seems no different to what we have seen in games like assassins creed, saints row and shadow of war, with this system being significantly slower and less graceful. And thats it, most of what you'll be doing in this ""10/10 experience"" ,climbing, running about fighting the same enemies, and doing shrines.

My overall opinion is that this game will lay the foundation for many great future zelda games but by no means is a masterpiece or even a great game, it has many fundamental flaws that are often looked over by the community and reviewers. But i guess as a reviewer it's much easier to put down a 10/10 score than to face backlash and potentially lose your job. Objectively i think the fun factor can only make up for so much, i voiced my main issues but didn't even cover other problems like sound and music.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

adversebeast,25-11-2019,"Es un juego entretenido al principio, pero con el paso de las horas se torna un poco monótono. El mapa gigantesco dividido en zonas, donde en cada una hay una torre (tipo atalaya de assasins creed), ademas de 4 templos los cuales debemos pasar una serie de pruebas. Esto se hace EN TODOS los mapas, es como una rutina, llegas a una zona y a hacer lo mismo. El sistema de combate es excelente, pero no así el sistema de armas. Creo que hacer armas que con un par de golpes se rompen no es una buena idea y tampoco nos permite hacernos una ""build"" debido a que constantemente hay que estar cambiando de armas. Insisto, el juego no es malo, pero teniendo tanto juego de mundo abierto con el que comparar la verdad no es la gran cosa. Aparte de los ""secretos"" que podemos encontrar en el mapa, en si es un mapa vacío en cuanto a ambientación, pero tampoco soy tan riguroso en ese aspecto, ya que por lo general los juegos de nintendo son así. Claramente no todo es malo, si te encanta la exploracion claramente este es un juego que te dará horas y horas de entretencion, llevo 40 horas jugadas y para ser sincero me está aburriendo un poco, pero quizá es porque ya estoy viejo y mis expectativas a la hora de jugar después de tantos años cada día son mas exigentes.

Xplocion,08-11-2019,"The good: another ""Zelda"" with a mature cut. An ""like a Nintendo"" approach to the open mute.

The bad: There are no temples. There are no cities. Few NPC to interact. It takes a long time to boot. The open world looks empty (on certain occasions). The story is silly. The hero mode came in a DLC. The best sword came in a DLC. There is no variety of enemies. There is no variety of bosses, always facing the shadow of Ganon and the Guardians. The graphics are bad, it doesn't look even remotely close to how it was presented or how it looked in trailers

Возможность готовить себе еду (и эта возможность нужна не для галочки), полнейшая свобода действий (пойти к боссу сразу же после прохождения туториала-это просто нечто), на первый взгляд простенькая, но если разобраться отменная боевая система, детально проработанный лор в игре (сюжет подаётся через воспоминания, диалоги, и окружение), и многое другое делает игру, пожалуй, одной из лучших в своем жанре.

JinxedViolynne,01-04-2019,"Opinions cannot be right or wrong. They are not facts.

They can be dishonest, and I believe this is why we're seeing so many 10/10 ratings for a game which doesn't deserve it.

For this review, I'm going to focus on the reasons the game garnered a 5/10 from me, and I'll do so by judging its own merits, not comparing to any other game. If you're new to the Zelda franchise or haven't touched it since the N64, this will be an unbiased review for your consideration.

BotW takes the Zelda franchise into a new direction: open world. Exploration is now free, as players can go anywhere they want, and set aside the main quest as they do so. The game also introduces new mechanics, but this has always been expected.

While it may seem like a great game on its surface, What was sacrificed tarnished my experience, and why I can never give this game a 10/10 rating.

Once Link leaves the cave, and the game's intro is complete, a player can literally go where ever they want. What the game doesn't tell you, though, are the rules for such an open game.

""Rules? Why do we need rules?""

Remember the day you first sat behind the wheel of a car. No reasonable person threw the keys and told you to ""learn as you go"". The very basic rules of engaging a car's operation were necessary before learning how to drive.

BotW throws us the keys and expects us to learn to drive. If players don't understand the rules, engaging the game becomes a frustrating experience.

Take the basic rule of cooking. In order to understand cooking early in the game, one must take an apple from an old man. This knowledge allows players to overcome the frozen hill.

Some will argue, ""But you were supposed to take the apple"", and with that, I'm going to challenge back and say, ""What apple?""

This is the dilemma of an open world game as not everyone will see or take the apple, which then turns into admonishment by those who did as they quickly blame the player for ""being stupid"". In an open world, it's impossible to determine what every player will do.

The lack of rules also play its part in the durability of weapons, so that we're forced to learn a tree branch is stronger than a rusty sword so we never touch rusty items ever again.

This is bad design, and it's no wonder the two most oft-spoken complaints are cooking and the weapon system, backed by a ""how to"" Google search.

Nintendo chose to sacrifice challenge for the open world as once players discover Cherry, the game's dynamic changes completely. From struggling to find decent weapons to being over-powered, such a dynamic is a problem for this type of game, because without challenges, boredom sets in quickly.

BotW gives us no challenge.

In 20 years, no one is ever going to say ""Remember how hard the elephant was?"" Each of the divines can be resolved quickly. Turning a room to slide a rock is not my idea of a challenge.

Instead, we get 120 shrines (120!), boring fetch quests, and if you're really into punishing game play, 900 Korok seeds to find. This is on top of fighting the same 12 monsters, becoming arrow sponges late in the game.

The game pushes these to hide the fact it offers nothing in return if you spend time chasing nuts or grasshoppers (yes, really!). I should point out the rewards for these quests are no different than what you find in the game world.

I do applaud Nintendo for taking the Zelda franchise into a new direction, but I don't believe this is the game fans wanted. I believe the open world has so many drooling, they fail to see the forest for the trees.

I'm disappointed we don't get to take what we've discovered and apply it to the open world.

Getting ""everything at once"" was a nice change, but for what justification? Using a bomb to turn on a fan? Taking out enemies because all the weapons broke? I saw no practical use for most of these outside of shrines.

This is extraordinarily important to state because I expected we can use these options in the open world as we did in previous titles.

The *only* time I used magnetism outside a shrine was to fix a pier, and this was on the plateau.

I have never used Stasis outside a shrine.

The ice and magnetism were for grabbing sunken chests. That's it. A vast, open world and none of it interactive but for blowing up rocks and chest fishing. I can't express how disappointed I was learning this. I know I said I wouldn't compare games, and I'm not, but never once was this an issue in previous Zelda titles. NEVER. ONCE. This is why I believe most reviews are dishonest as they're formed from fan bias, not actual game play experience. I still recommend this game despite its issues because games are subjective. The only way to know for sure is to play it yourself. Just... take the 10/10 reviews with a truckload of salt, please. It's all I ask.

tkmtch,29-08-2019,"I guess the score on this game really depends on 2 things; whether you like completing simple puzzles or not, and whether you enjoy exploring rather empty map or not. I didn't enjoy the shrine puzzles or Korok seed puzzles all over the map, if you don't then there's nothing to look for out in the map, so while I love exploring the world in most open world games, exploring post apocalyptic Hyrule really felt empty and almost meaningless.
Also, fighting enemies was really fun at first but it became meaningless as well in the last half of the game. This game has no exp or level system, so you make Link stronger by collecting better weapons and armors/clothes. Since the weapon breaks constantly and there's no way to repair it, constantly updating your weapon through combat is really fun, it takes part in making the player feel that they are progressing. However about half way past the game I've collected good weapons, and I've already learned what kind of weapons the enemies have, and at this point I realized there's nothing I can gain from beating the enemies, so I just run past them. There's a lot of ways you can use environments to fight enemies and that's one of the things people love about this game, but what's the point if you aren't earning anything from them?
So for me, most of the shrines and Korok puzzles were boring(and I started to wish the Korok won't be there when I lift the damn rocks, and they are always there), the combat was meaningless, and it meant there's nothing out there in this world that's interesting except for some rare occasions and encounters. Most of the side quests were boring too, I tend to not mind about having to do fetch quests in most games, but in this game I never really enjoyed it.

The map and the world build on it is really great, some people will find it worth walking around even if it is empty. But if that's the case the Korok puzzles will get rather annoying. It becomes a distraction rather than an interesting interaction.
In addition to the great world map, being able to climb almost anything and glide from heights is really epic and gives a whole lot of freedom to exploration.

Overall Nintendo has made a great playground but failed to provide enough content worth paying attention in that play ground, at least for me.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Lobuttomize,23-09-2019,"$15-20/$60 It is fun but it's very shallow and empty. Story is generic Zelda stuff, won't go into it a ton but it's pretty empty. The side quests are generally 1 part and don't add much to the game. The world is very open but there's not much of a reason to explore it besides completion purposes. I feel the armor system was done very poorly because-- unless you have to for weather-- there's no reason to wear anything but the Weapon Damage set (unless you think you're bad and need the high armor value set.) The last boss fight is extremely simple and easy if you can master deflecting lasers and can be done without doing the rest of the main story. Enemy variation is probably my biggest letdown because I expected much more from such a large world but the vast majority of enemies you meet will be the lizard guys or skeletons. There's also no post-game which is par-for-the-course for Zelda but I think should be included in open-world games, especially ones with not much true content. In summary: the game is almost entirely about exploring and you won't find much, but there's still some fun in that itself.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Chempion1,18-08-2021,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild это первая Зельда в которую я играл. Так что буду судить не как фанатик серии, а с точки зрения итереса, погружения и общего удобства геймплея.
Да игра очень масштабная, можно пробежать за десяток часов, а можно и все 60 убить. Мир очень большой и не пустой, в нем всегда есть что делать.
Выглядит игра не плохо, картинка очень приятная, конечно о какой либо супер детализации говорить не приходится это же Swich. Очень интересные загадки в святилищах и чудищах, но с оговоркой о которой написал ниже. История в принципе понравилась, но подаётся она очень странно, в редких кат-сценах. Во всё остальное время это только текст и что то пищащие и угукающие нпс.
Теперь о том, что мне не понравилось.
Это боевая система она какая то не отзывчивая, нет перекатов, уворотов, а очень хочется.
Оружие тоже так себе, оно всё за редким исключением очень хрупкое, по сильным врагам достаточно 10 ударов и оно разлетается. Может это фишка, но мне она не понравилась.
Конечно же меню вещмешка, на мой взгляд самое неудобное какое мне только встречалось. В нем разные вещи разделены по типам, но ощущение такое, что всё свалено в одну кучу и иногда приходится перелистывать все мечи, луки, стрелы, костюмы, ингредиенты, что бы добраться до какой нибудь лечилки. Очень не удобно.
Теперь про святилища. Уровень сложности в них скачет от очень легких до жопораздирающих, на прохождение которых уходит более часа времени, при том и за первые, и за вторые награда одинаковая.
Так же мне не понравились враги. Их очень мало разновидностей. В разных областях карты встречаются одни и те же монстры но в разной одежде, разного цвета и с разной шкалой здоровья.
Наконец прокачка. Она какая то очень простенькая для рпг.
А ещё у меня Ва-Рудания зависла на горе смерти, да так, что пройти это чудище стало невозможно, так как в игре всего десять или меньше сейвов (которые обновляются сами по себе стирая более старые). Пришлось проходить игру сначала.
Ещё крайне бесили ""кроволуния"", на мой взгляд явлениние через чур частое. При этом в игре нет никакого гринда уровней.
И так резюмирую.
Игра далеко не идеальна, я не понимаю оценок в 10 из 10 и термина ""идеал"". Игре есть куда расти, в ней много недостатков, которые многие критики приписывают к фишкам. Что ж, это плохие фишки. Но у игры есть два абсолютно непререкаемых достоинства. Это атмосфера, она здесь на высоте и мобильность. Swich дарит возможность пройти игру где угодно, и это будет не вынос мозга и не вывих пальцев, а достаточно приятное времяпрепровождение.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Aquinas76,13-10-2019,"The first few hours playing this game were incredible...but then the polish wore off and I saw this game for what it truly was.
Do you love Zelda for the immersive story? Well then don't bother with this one, because there is no story. Only some old memories that you find in a diary. Sad.
How about gameplay? Well thanks to the weapons breaking mechanic they added, I tallied some of my weapons breaking after a mere SEVEN SWINGS!!!! Oh you liked that weapon? Too bad. It's gone.
Do you love Zelda for its world famous dungeons? Lol well guess what? THERE ARE NO DUNGEONS!!!!! Just 4 ""Divine Beasts"" that each take 15 minutes to complete and they all look the same...and guess what? all the bosses look exactly the4 same as well? Think i'm kidding? Buy the game and find out.
But this Zelda does bring something new to the table. A Zelda without a villian. Yup. No menace with any lines at all. Yes ""Ganon"" is in the game, but he has ZERO LINES.
By the end of the game I realized that it wasn't about to get any better. I was at the end. the game was just one heaping pile of crap. and i'm a Zelda fan going back 20 years. But this game, this game can go screw itself.

Boring, no Zelda elements in it at all, with no story and terrible weapons breaking mechanic made this the worst Zelda game I have ever played. Don't bother.

L'exploration est vraiment au cœur du jeu avec juste un point de quête et débrouille toi pour y aller, c'est vraiment plaisant de joué à sa manière dans un open world qui possède son background, une ambiance et une physique très réussie.

A huge open over world filled with beautiful and dynamic environments coupled with very stylized visuals will keep you immersed and whiling to explore for hours.
You are free to go anywhere and do anything you want from the get go, so you can proceed to complete the story line, which has voice acting and cut scenes, in any order you wish or just relax and forage for edibles and cook delicious meals by a camp fire, hunt down monsters which can be very challenging at times, complete mini dungeons to expand your hearts and stamina, etc.
One important thing to note is that much like the edibles and other consumables you can find in the world, your weapons and shields are also perishable and will eventually break, forcing you to approach exploration and combat in a more methodical and resourceful way.

Poochingus,14-11-2019,"Not the best in the series, not by far. What Breath of the wild shows us however, is potential. This game lays the groundwork for what a truly great breath of fresh air the series could see. However ambition clearly outpaced the ability to make a game as deep as previous titles. Zelda games are known for being handcrafted experiences with unique areas, wonderful music, and compelling characters and story.

While this game is huge, most of it feels the same. The same looking NPCs fill the roads and stables wearing the same clothes. The same design is even used in every dungeon and shines(the mini dungeons littered across the land). In addition you only get the sword, bow, bombs, and 3 other dungeon tools, the fewest tools we have ever seen. Considering how much they did with these tools though, it makes me wonder what amazing things they could have done with a few more fun toys to play with.

At the end of the day, the story takes a backseat to gameplay too. What little story we do get is almost entirely optional, and that feels bad, like the noble sacrifices made, and the people inhabiting the world don't matter.

Music was the biggest letdown for me. The lack of any real music outside a handful of tracks made me very sad in a series that utilitzes music as a gameplay mechanic extremely often(ocarina of time, Link's awakening, spirit tracks, oracles).

After a while I got tired of fighting the same enemies and finding rewards that were just more items meant to be sold for money to buy what, a house?

That being said the item system was exciting. Shields as surfboards, elemental swords and weapon types were fun to use. While breaking weapons was a little easier than I wished, it was fun to try new strategies on enemies and in boss fights. The combat is where the game shines.

Overall I would say the game is great as a game first, and that must be remembered. I hope the next main title learns from the mistakes here and can try to use the new systems in a fun and unique way while bringing back what made zelda games so beloved.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AndreAlexandr,14-11-2019,"This is undeniably one of the best games of its year and has a very likeful world to explore, but in the matter of a Zelda game, most of the fuzz about it is just noise.

It is off course a good game that deserve to be treated with care and has very enjoyable aspects (i myself find much funnier keep gathering all types of food to try new cooking recipes than keep fighting all monsters along my way), but we need to admit it has its flaws too.

One of these is in the ""dungeons"".,, They are clever and all, but theres so many of them and they were so resumed to ""a single challenge"" that, sometimes, you do them just to do, like in a casual mobile game on cellphone when you has free time and not too much options at hand.

Like i already said, the world is really likeful: bright and shiny colors, animals sharing space with monsters everywhere, NPCs at almost every corner with something to say and even some secrets under rocks if you search well, BUT it outshine the feel of be part of the world for the player since nothing looks to endure too much.

Only a couple NPCs has a quest more long than 2 or 3 tasks and complete their side quests don't have any influence over the big picture. Even the main quest CAN be so long than you want it to be; it's only one and, to complete it, you can just choose to go straight to final boss or pass for some trouble solving the issues with the ""giant robots that don't assemble a bigger Voltron like robot"", but all straight and direct. Simply ""go to point A, beat puzzle B, defeat boss C, collect reward D"" and nothing more.

This is also one of the few games I've played where the issues other people have are invisible to me, I had to re read Jim Sterling's review (I view Jim as an idiot but it's hard to argue against the issues he has with this) and rewatch Matthew Matosis' review to remember what some of the issues were that this game has.

penebullone,30-10-2020,"Может, я чего-то не понимаю, но примерно пяти попыток полюбить эту игру мне не хватило.

Коротко озвучу, что мне не понравилось: мир кажется пустым. Мб в нём можно как-то развлекаться, если открыть все супер-весёлые механики игры, но если честно, я обычно жду мини-обучение в таких случаях, или что-то вроде. Второе - я не могу привыкнуть к тому, что всё оружие, луки и щиты разваливаются от пары ударов. По-моему, вот это - это просто бред. Я бы ещё понял, если бы это были какие-нибудь ветки или деревянные мечи, но нет, это же, блин, оружие! Повторюсь, наверное, я чего-то не понимаю.

Из самого необъективного в моём отзыве - мне не очень нравятся головоломки. Ну вернее, головоломки конкретно в этой игре. Залезть огромному механическому слону на спину и покрутить какое-то колесо, чтобы он поднял хобот и полил себе в дыру в спине, решив таким образом квест, ну это, наверное, круто для кого-то, но меня такие головоломки добивают. Ещё из минусов - боёвка. Мб это стики Свитча, но импровизированный Дарк Соулс в Зельде БОТВ вселяет в меня чувство, будто у меня очень кривые пальцы.

Persona5Royal,18-12-2019,"Simply put, nowhere near as great as previous games in the series.

This game would be fantastic IF it didn't have limited stamina or weapon and shield fragility; both of these are nothing more than unnecessary hindrances and limitations that ruin various aspects of gameplay.

If your stamina gauge runs out, you're forced to wait for it to refill, which is a waste of time and not fun at all. It's especially bad when climbing, since running out means falling off and likely dying. If you manage to reach a foothold to recharge your stamina, you're stuck on that foothold until the gauge refills. The same applies to rain, by the way.

As for weapon and shield fragility, this hindrance renders combat a net negative, since you'll almost always come out with broken gear and acquiring worse equipment than what was used. In previous games, the random Bokoblin was nothing more than a second's distraction to try to get a few more Rupees or a heart, since there was no downside to slaying them on your way to a collectible or story progression. In Breath of the Wild, random enemies are to be avoided since they'll just result in broken equipment with absolutely nothing worthwhile to show for it.
Furthermore, weapon and shield fragility inherently lowers the value of high-quality loot, since it'll break all the same. Literally everything is breakable and worthless because of this stupid mechanic.

Other open-world games have done well without these hindrances - Skyrim, for example, lacks weapon/shield fragility, while Assassin's Creed lacks both. Middle-earth also lacks either hindrance. These games know that artificially limiting the player is an inherent negative. Furthermore, there's been much more compelling Legend of Zelda games too - Twilight Princess has fantastic characters, a wonderful plot, unforgettably-good dungeons, and flawless gameplay across all three releases. The Wind Waker has better combat, a more interesting Link, an actual narrative, and better dungeons. Link's Awakening has a more compelling world and characters, interesting dungeons and fun gameplay.",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Tyrant719,05-11-2020,"This is absolutely one of the most overrated games I have ever had the misfortune of purchasing. Without getting too far into it, I never played Zelda growing up. I never even touched a Zelda game until this year, when I played Phantom Hourglass, Twilight Princess, and the Oracle games. Twilight Princess got a pass because I play it on a hand-me-down Wii with shoddy controllers. The others seemed truncated due to being on handhelds. All of them had the same thing in common: tedious puzzles that pretend not to, but definitely do, assume everyone playing will either play with others or play with a walkthrough. It’s clear from the design of the game that that’s the case and I also know, from doing my homework, that the original Zelda was, in fact, designed and marketed to be played with a walkthrough. I hate that. I don’t appreciate walkthrough games. If you need some data, that’s fine. When large portions of the game are predicated on knowing some outside knowledge that isn’t actually given to the character or the player directly, that’s bad game design. When I got a Switch, which I love and love the games, I got this game first because I was told it isn’t like typical Zelda with vague puzzles, side quests, or objectives; I was mislead. I wanted to leave this review simply for the cost of this game. This game is the equivalent of a Marvel movie, formulaic for people who eat it up and good enough for those who want substance. It does LOOK different, with the large (mostly empty) map. Another thing that reminded me of Marvel: large graphic landscapes/rooms with little to nothing inside. It’s fine for what it is. I don’t enjoy having over 50 shrines left to find after having already defeated the four Divine Beasts, though. Plus, I have countless other side quests to do that seem to take forever just to find pieces of. The whole thing is just a time suck, and in the most mundane way. It’s not made interesting, it’s essentially a hiking simulator with larpers runnings around. The open world aspect of this game took the already frustrating parts of Zelda (countless tedious backtracking and struggling to remember throwaway dialogue) and amplified them tenfold. Simply put, this game is for Zelda fans. Zelda fans don’t seem to like other games aside from Zelda, Mario and Super Smash Bros. If those are for you, I’m sure all your favorite reviewers already told you how awesome this game is. If you like games that don’t require blind fanboy goggles, this probably isn’t for you. The combat is laughably bad for a game that looks so good. You’re better off cheesing and spamming moves than trying to figure out whatever they call combat. The story is literally a paragraph long. Gabon rose to power in the past because he always does, no matter how many times he loses. Link, Zelda, and four champions assemble (that’s the extent of the backstory they give behind it, I didn’t leave anything out) they fail, Link is preserved to fight in the future due to injury and he wakes up with stunted memory after 100 years to start the journey. That’s it. You could literally write that on a pamphlet. Then the rest of the story is Link remembering various pointless details that add nothing to his overall objectives. He even remembers a love interest of his that was a champion that doesn’t effect anything because the open world nature of the map made them keep each champion storyline vague with no real chronology mentioned. I compared this to Marvel earlier but, it’s more like a DC movie story wise.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Of course this game is not without its flaws and frustrations thought but I still enjoyed playing the game but I felt no desire to finishing wining the game and I am satisfied with that. The over the top weapon breakage, champion skills recharge patterns, excessive limiting of arrows and gimmicky combat? Yea it gets tiring too soon. Enemies are not difficult until you get used to them... and then... they are just way to easy the challenge leaves the game and you are left with a piece of emptiness and that breaks a certain idea of balance for me.

Esto hace que la experiencia de exploración de un mundo tan grande resulte poco gratificante ya que el premio por hacerlo no es minimamente necesario.
Si han intentado hacerlo mas RPG, se han quedado cortos en el sistema de progresión dándote todas las habilidades necesarias en la primera hora de juego.

SimonHofling,05-08-2021,"A HUGE WORLD VOID OF MEANING

I am a long time Zelda fan. I have played every Zelda title except some of the handheld games. I also enjoy the concept of open world. So, based on that, Breath of the Wild should could be a success, right? Well, it isn't. In fact, it's a massive failure of a game and I'm going to tell you why.

BOTW has many flaws, but one of the most basic is the complete lack of narrative or story. This isn't a bad story; THERE IS NO STORY HERE. One key element of every Zelda since A link to the past has been a captivating, fairytale-like story. But BOTW has no story. A background and setting is presented, but that is all. You run across this vast landscape to complete four major tasks that are completely isolated from one another. In every good story there is a progression; the story BUILDS until it climaxes, and may take many turns on its way there. But BOTW has no storyline progression. It doesn't matter what you do, or when you do it. You might as well run to the final boss straight from the beginning if you're skilled enough. The side quests are also short, simple and meaningless. They are not layered or complex in any way and don't make me feel anything or care about any of the characters. For comparison one can look at Majoras Mask where there is so much optional content, but every side-story and optional quest is intruiging and provokes many emotions. With BOTW I simply feel nothing. There is no main story, there are no memorable characters and the side quests are pointless. And no; making an open world game is not an excuse for not having a narrative. There are many games that could accomplish both. Why they didn't even try with BOTW is a mystery.

Another component is the lack of dungeons and levels. The level design (if there is one) is just bad. You just run around this random topography and climb a mountain, glide down, go through a forest, swim around etc. Even though the world is huge no matter where you go every place feels as meaningless as where you came from. There is no place on the map that has character. It's just a giant field of random terrain. Compare this to something like Ocarina of time that has such a small, yet rich world, where every place you visit has its own magic and meaning. The boss fights are also boring and poorly designed.

With these huge flaws in place it feels almost like a bad joke how much time they have obiously spent on details such as cooking, weather and elemental effects. These things are not bad in themselves but to me they are of such minor importance. I simply do not care about running around and collecting flowers if I'm not driven by a captivating story and feel that the game is fun to play. BOTW is never fun to play it's just annoying running across these huge areas searching for shrines or loot.

Another disturbing thing is that the game is basically devoid of music. Strong music is such a core part of any good Zelda game but this game has almost no music. And when there is music it is so quiet that it falls silently into the background.

So what is this game then, to sum it up? It is a crappy survival simulator. There is no story, no meaningful characters, no dungeons, no fun item collection. The game has no progression. I don't feel like I'm moving forward. I'm just running around and collecting **** that grows everywhere until I'm finally strong enough to face the final boss. That's not a good Zelda game to me. It's not even a good game. After playing for a few hours my son said to me ""let's play majoras mask instead"". And we did, and it's such an amazing game. We did recently finish BOTW. Not because it was fun, but because we wanted to play it through before judgint it. And I am sad to say the first impression was right. This is the worst Zelda game ever and a bad game by any rating.

Learn from this Nintendo and bring Zelda in the right direction with your next game. Open world gameplay can be implemented into Zelda, but not at the sacrifice of everything that made traditional Zelda good. Find a way to fix it or you're going to lose the players.",4,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
cryptzombie45,09-03-2020,"The game is good and it might be a sandbox in the same sense as Skyrim but Skyrim's sand box is a hell of a lot deeper than BoTW.

the good:

large world
a lot of content to do (easily 200 hours worth depending on what you consider ""content"" to be)
large weapon variety
engaging combat system that rewards you for paying attention to your enemy's habits
the world is fun in the sense that coming up against a mountain isn't a hassle. It's an opportunity to climb it and figure out the most efficient way to get over it which is nice

the bad:

The world feels empty. You can walk through empty fields finding nothing but wind and solitary birds. It doesn't happen a lot but it does happen
Travel can be a pain. For example: Even after obtaining the armor which helps you swim faster, you don't feel like you can swim for miles and miles. You go from being able to swim 3 feet in front of you to being able to maybe swim 5 yards before drowning like a dolt. Travelling on foot can be equally trying.

chill_daffodil1,12-09-2020,"This is my new favorite game of all time.

Does it have it's issues? Of course, severe lack of story, items breaking too quickly, frame rate drops, and half-assed voice acting are the things that bugged me the most. The story really left me wanting more. Characters often speak of the epic battle that took down Hyrule's strongest warriors 100 years ago, but you never get to see any of the battle. It really was a missed opportunity, but I'm happy to see Nintendo is going all in after the new Hyrule Warriors announcement. Items breaking too quickly sucks, especially because stasis uses weapon durability which makes me hate having to use it for shrines. The frame rate does drop during larger battles and bomb arrows in particular caused turbulence. Although it's definitely noticeable it isn't game breaking and after all you are playing a console quality game on handheld so I let it slide. My final criticism is the voice acting. I felt like it feels extremely out of place. Nintendo should have either left voice acting out of the game or made every word voice acted. Instead they decided to just give the story cut scenes voice acting. It feels very out of place and breaks immersion completely.

However, those are minor details when you just look at how incredibly fun and exciting this game really is. The combat is wonderful, there is an almost endless amount of things to do, and the art style and music are wonderful. The combat is very fun. I really liked how there aren't any big gimmicks. You don't focus on stealth or have any major special abilities, you kind of just get to whack guys with swords and I really liked it. The amount of content in this game is incredible. There are so many side quests, shrines, and koroks you could easily play this for hundreds of hours. I also really liked the art style. It has this really pretty cell shaded look with bright colors that pop. The animations and character models are all on point too. I know that there are some criticisms when it comes to the music that I can understand, but I personally feel like it fits the game perfectly.

What this game does so perfectly though is exploration and freedom of choice. There are very few things that this game requires you to do. You just have to beat the tutorial and beat Gannon. Sure there are the divine beasts that are the intended way to play the game, but you don't need to if you don't want to. You get to do what you want to do. And I think that that's what makes this game so good. You want to go over to that shrine over there? Do it or don't. I'm not your mom, I don't care. You want to talk to that guy and help him? Okay go ahead, or don't. You want to explore those mountains? Sure, go ahead. You get to do what you want, when you want, and how you want. And that's why this game is so special, it is pure freedom and I love it.

There is not a single thing that this game lets it go by. The story is amazing, the gameplay is lushy, the soundtrack is art. And if you still thinks that it lacks something, I'm sure that the DLCs will live up to fill that.

Zetsubouda,02-08-2020,"Just finished the game last week, and here what i thought about the game

Story: The plot is simple, where you become a hero and save the princess from the hands of bad guys. The twist is, you're the only one left to make it more worst you lost your memories. So you have to explore a vast map to find out your own path.

Combat: The combat aren't very good, because you have to prepare a lot of weapons. For the battles themselves it's quite easy, and what's even more challenging is the fight against Ganon.

Gimmick: I think the gimmick that was presented in this game that made this game get the title of game of the year in 2017. Where in this game you have to wear armor that is devoted to cold places, and wear light clothing in the desert. Change iron-based equipment into wood during thunderstorms, because you can get struck by lightning.

-This game is suitable for people who like to wander without direction, or like to find their own way.
-This game is not suitable for people who prefer to know the direction of their path, and prefer games that focus on the story. (i belong to this group)

The breakable weapon system is flawed because it does NOT redeem itself later by allowing the player to find an ultimate, unbreakable, reliable weapon to give closure to the system. It forces you to deal with its breakable weapons the entire game, INCLUDING the Hylian Shield, and having to recharge the Master Sword. The player NEVER gets the feeling of satisfaction and security and completion knowing he has finally worked his way up and acquired the final unbreakable weapons. There ARE NO unconditionally unbreakable weapons. This is DEEPLY disappointing, and an absolute deal breaker! Even at his most ""leveled up"" in the game, no matter how much time you spend building up Link, he will ALWAYS be forced to walk around Hyrule, as the Hero of Time, with BREAKABLE weapons. Again, this would be fine if it redeemed itself later on, but it doesn't. It's an open-ended, ongoing weapon breaking system. No unconditionally powerful Master Sword or Shield.

010101010100,03-10-2020,"I will start by saying that I have played every Zelda game, even the off-brand CD-i Games, And I have loved most of them, and at least liked all of them. This game is my least favorite zelda game by far. This game could have been so much more. It feels like they made a game, and just slapped ""zelda"" on it, without including what made LoZ great. Dungeons: There aren't any. The divine beasts just feel like shrines that are in a machine instead of an underground stone structure. The shrines/beasts themselves are very linear, but too small to make up for it. A lot of previous LoZ dungeons were linear, but you would get a cool item and have secrets to find. the shrines and korok seeds are the ""rewards."" There is no sense of accomplishment. Many people dislike the durability, but I actually find that to be one of the good things about the game. However, where are the tools and various items you aquire? Instead they give you a few tools within the first 20 minutes. IMHO, if I can fight the final boss and win within the first 2 hours of playing a game, that is a waste of my money. There is no feeling that link is becoming a better hero throughout the game. The only LoZ that had a worse story was link's crossbow training (lol). The characters had no depth to them, and it felt like the towns were there just for you to look at while walking up to the town leader to progress. This game focused everything on looks, and somehow ended up with an empty world still, and looks don't equate to gaming experience (just play OoT. Very angular graphics, phenomenal gameplay.) A lot of people praise the combat, but this game's combat is trash compared to TP and WW. The combat could be a lot better however with one thing: BUTTON MAPPING. They changed controls for SS, but that was for the wii, makes sense to be different. They then switched their controllers to have the same button placement as before, and then switched the controls. Why can't i swing my weapon with B? They said, let's make a LoZ game that's like an elder scrolls game, but we'll make the controls different than either of those. The controls are so unintuitive, it ruins the game. after beating the game to 100% twice (all shrines and all seeds, which is a waste of time), I still find myself pressing the wrong buttons constantly. I'm also very used to FromSoftware games as well, so It isn't a muscle memory thing. The button that feels like it should do something, it does something completely different. This could have been completely avoided if we could change the controls (you can switch jump to B and run to X,, but I don't want run to be x or b, or for jump to be x or b, so). It's a zelda game. Attack is B, period. with how many times I want to run and then jump, why can't the buttons be next to each other? The bosses suck. reskins of the same MF. And then, somehow fighting the final boss at full health right after leaving the plateau is easier than the other 4 you fight. If you say tools, bosses and dungeons aren't the reason you play Zelda, then you're an idiot and should play different games that are made for running around with no goal. They threw out everything that made me love zelda. I will check as much gameplay as possible before buying another zelda game (the reviews are clearly not reliable) because if the new zelda games are going to be more like this than previous titles, then I will have to say goodbye to playing zelda.",1,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I just got bored, i found that the narrative, of what I played of course, wasn't appealing to me at all. But I do respect the heavy work on gameplay, Nintendo have tried to make this game fun to play, and it is in some respects. But I wish it was more diverse. Walking around finding shirnes does get a little old, and seems like theres limited variety in what you can find around the map. Its just shrines, settlements and a big ass volcano with Ganons castle. Yes, there are ruins and cool cinematics that go to Links past, but they are not incredibly interesting to me. As far as ruins go its mainly just broken down castles or stone structures, and most of all the Guardian robots that I feel like Ive seen enough of by 7 hours in. Now im not the biggest lover of RPGs of any sorts but I know what I find cool and appealing, and i also know what an RPG needs. This has all of it, but for me its lacking somewhere. The reason I don't much like RPGs is because I like the structure of a linear story...when its done right. In an RPG you do what quests you want at any time. Theres no proper route to the story, making it less of a believable experience. Games that do this well are TLOU and LiS, because their shorter stories are played out the way they should be, making the player on edge, rather than constantly making you feel like you're playing a digitalised checklist...like in an RPG. All im saying is that if you are not too fond of RPGs and want to play one...I would honestly play Skyrim or The Witcher 3 than this. Don't get me wrong, there are things I love about BOTW. The art-style is a joy to look at and take in, the inventory management system and some combat mechanics are good and enjoyable at some points. But some enemies I find lackluster, and I can't stop thinking about how the Guardians remind me of the Ball robot from the Incredibles. I'm sorry, I saw a meme once and now I can't unsee it. If you like BOTW, then great. Enjoy the game, but in my opinion, it's not the masterpiece that everyone says it is.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bancandrei,12-05-2020,"A truly great game. The epitome of an open world and exploration in video games. The fact that you can pretty much go anywhere, do anything, and the painterly cell-shaded graphics ensure that this game will hardly be dated 10 years from now, maybe even a lot longer. Can't wait for the sequel
It is however exceedingly childish at points and I don't really see what little voice acting they did put in added to the table. Lack of proper dungeons and memorable tunes make it a bit disappointing for something with the title of Zelda.
This is a very good counter point to the souls series. Combining the two could yield the greatest game yet.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

DemonicRobots,19-10-2021,"There isn't much to say about The Legend of Zelda. To me, it is the perfect open world game. It is ripe with exploration where it really feels like you can do whatever you want however you want, and it truly rewards this experience with such a variety of content that it is impossible to come across it all without sinking hundreds of hours into the game. The combat and collecting is excellent and well-made and the story fits the theme and settings perfectly. Everything has so much character and charm that it really feels like everything single thing in the game was maticuously crafted. Combat rewards you by trying multiple things or just the standard slice-and-dice, meaning you never really feel like you are forced into doing one thing or going one place. The soundtrack is fantastically scored and really helps set the mood for combat while acting as a gameplay indicator for when you are spotted and by what. Playing this on the Switch even the graphics are still great, and the art style pops extremely well on the OLED Switch. In fact, I am doing a full playthrough again on it just to experience it once more.There is pretty much nothing that I can objectively that is wrong with the game... But I will admit personally my time had a few frustrating areas. I prefer linear games because I like to be guided, and prefer to have choices limited in where to go and what to do with my combat options being freeform and open. An example of a game that I felt did this well was The Last of Us 2. And for me, personally, Breath of the Wild was too open for me. I ended up abandoning a lot of important stuff and side quests because I simply didn't know what to do or how to approach it, and I wandered a lot and got lost quite often which was more frustrating for me. Even the cooking was overwhelming for me trying to figure out ingredients and I kept hoarding items the entire game I never got use out of because I didn't know what to do. Now that I've beaten the game I feel with a guide I will enjoy trying to 100% this game or at least do a lot more, but I can't say I had that fascination and wonder that everyone else had because this isn't my type of game. But that doesn't mean I can't see how good it is. Like a movie critic who hates romanctic comedies, they can still appreciate the talent, hard effort, and skill even if they don't like the genre. Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is the perfect open-world game, and even if it wasn't a game for me, I still enjoy purely for the skill that it took to make it and I look forward to beating the second one with eager delight.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Sb068,21-06-2020,"LOZ: Breath if the Wild is great, but not the greatest game of all time. It sure has its flaws, like the weapons breaking too fast, way too much korok seeds and shrines (thought both optional) and it misses some key elements of the Zelda franchise, like items you can acquire through dungeons. But this doesn't mean it's a bad Zelda game (there is no bad Zelda game)

The world is alive thanks to its environment. There is so much to explore this game will keep you entertained for at least 80 hours. I think the weapons breaking makes you feel like you're in a survival situation and it makes you think twice before spamming your attacks.

After the initial island quest, I stumbled all the way to the village of Kakaliko, which is no doubt a 10-point game, but the later the game's content is stretched to the limit, the less willingness to play.

captainsnake,21-07-2020,"Breakable weapons aren't bad- they require you to think on your feet and let you make interesting plans in combat. With breakable weapons, I can light my spear on fire and throw it into an enemies camp to blow up explosives near the enemies. Letting me treat weapons as disposable led to significantly more fun combat experiences. As some reviewers have said it may have been a good idea to give the player one final unbreakable weapon at the end of the game, but that's nowhere near a big enough problem to detract a point.

The combat is amazing. It's not like a normal combat system. You don't just slash your way to victory- a smart player needs to use the environment. Distracting enemies with an explosion near them while you sneak up from behind, setting the grass on fire to create an updraft and then flying up to take a camp of enemies from above, and pushing enemies off cliffs with magnetic boxes were just a few of ways the physics system allows for creative ways of fighting.

But the best moments in Breath of the Wild isn't the intense strategic combat but the moments where subtle piano queues played as the sun rose and I looked off a cliff to the beautiful scenery. It's truly the negative space in this game that makes it the masterpiece that it is.

BL0ODYHAMSTER,10-07-2020,"Breath of The Wild is the first Zelda game I have ever tried to finish. Saying that I ""tried"" to finish means I never did finish, and I'll outline a reason why here.

I'll start off with graphics, that this game looks amazing for a switch game. The game proves that it doesn't need a strong graphic card to produce great visuals. Art style is very charming and the world is very lush, and feels very well thought out. Probably my only gripe really is the frames dropping on occasion and the stamina meter making the world feel a little dull on some points.

The sounds in this game is also quite good. Not much to say here and honestly no real problems with any here.

Gameplay is my biggest concern sadly. For how long the game is, I really did not like the weapon system. I like to use the new weapons and all the different style it provides but I hate that your weapons can break. Like I absolutely hate that feature. Weapons that I love will break and I have to find a new one to replace it, quite a bit annoying honestly. I thought the stamina feature was fine, but also did not enjoy that aspect of the game. Puzzles are great honestly, and the combat was adequate. However because of the weapon degradation and the lack of cool amazing abilities to keep me invested I can't say the game play kept me engage.

Story was about average, Ganandorf has Zelda in the castle and you as Link has to go save her. You can go to each ancient weapons from each tribe to help them out and gain more lore but you can also easily go straight to Ganondorf and attack him straight on if you feel ballsy enough. The story is straight forward enough that I enjoyed it to an extent but doesn't make me feel all that engage.

So this is where my score seems a bit low for such a legendary game. The gameplay and the story itself really hindered it for me to actually fully complete the game. I was invested just enough to play and see the side story for each tribes but because of my weapons breaking, and the lack of meaningful upgrades with about average story really didn't push me to finish it. I ended up getting all 4 tribes done and I went to Hyrule and stopped....mostly because all the interesting story was done and saving Zelda really didn't seem all that interesting.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Lo fantástico de la historia es que me generó curiosidad sobre todos los personajes y querer saber más sobre cada uno de ellos, lo cual al finalizar el juego y su DLC ""La balada de los campeones"" me quede con ganas de saber más, esto algunos puede ser malo, pero por alguna extraña razón para mi no, si no al contrario, me envolvió a la saga de Zelda, ya que BOTW es mi primer juego de la saga.
Las batallas fueron entretenidas, pero nada extraordinario, depende mucho de las armas y objetos que utilices, ya es cuestión de la creatividad e ingenio de cada uno.
Por ultimo tengo que decir que conforme iba avanzando el juego poco a poco iba sintiendo la experiencia de ""héroe"" como si uno mismo encarnará a Link.

I'd argue it's one of the best games ever... except the inventory system is so infuriating that I consistently log off the game. I can't play it long. I havn't beaten it and I walk away from it for weeks or months because of the inventory and weapons breaking system. I hate it so much and is one of the biggest misses in the history of video games.

I felt this way with skyward sword and it's controller mechanics. To this day that's only other Zelda game that I have not beaten (besides the weird 3d0 PC games that came out woof).

ClementeAntonio,07-07-2020,"sin duda alguna the legend of zelda a vuelto y mejor que nunca con un mundo abierto hermoso en todos los aspectos con una banda sonora sutil pero preocupandose un poco mas en el sonido del ambiente en lo personal me encanto la banda sonoroa, el gameplay de lo mejor de zelda con un combate muy entretenido con diferentes armas como: espadas, arcos, bumerang y la tableta sheika que tiene distintas funciones.
No todo son flores por que la historia es un poco flojo a diferencia que sus predecesores ademas no todos adoran su banda sonora (en lo personal me encanta).
los puzles son divertidos te haran pensar bastante con mas de 100 santuarios sin embargo el diseño de ellos despues de un tiempo se te haran repititivo ( me refiero al color utilizado etc)
la ingenialidad de la tableta sheika es un agregado algo muy original, creativo y divertido podiendo pasar de miles de forma los santuarios, puzles.
el diseño jefes ( a exepcion a ganondorf) no es su mayor fuerte sin embargo es bastante divertido pelear contra ellos.
el mejor aspecto sin duda alguna de este videojuego es el mapa increible gigante con un gran contenido que te divertira mas de 100 horas con muchas misiones secundarias bastantes enemigos muchos secretos,con una libertad inmensa tanto asi que te permite derrotar al jefe nada mas terminal la introduccion, sin duda alguna the legend of zelda breath of the wild es un juego que quedara en la historia por su gran calidad lo recomiendo mas que ningun otro juego realmente no te va decepcionar.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Truh,09-07-2020,"Breath of the wild ist eigentlich ein sehr gutes Spiel allerdings nicht als zelda Spiel. Von denen bin ich dungeons, kleinere nebenquests und ein lineares Weltdesign gewohnt. BotW macht alles anders. Keine richtigen dungeons, unzählige nebenquests und eine riesige Open world. Die Idee schreibe auf der ganzen mal zu suchen um mehr Herzen zu erlangen und die Ausdauer zu erweitern ist zwar eine gute Idee aber dieses Spiel hat es damit zu weit getrieben. 120 schreine gibt es insgesamt im normalen Spiel ohne DLC's. Außerdem wurden 900 Krogs versteckt. Sie alle zu suchen wird auf Dauer sehr langweilig da die Rätsel immer wieder das gleiche sind. Und auch die belonungen die du bekommst wenn du alles sammelst was es gibt sind eher dürftig. Für die 120 schreine erhältst du eine Rüstung die zu dem Zeitpunkt schon überhaupt nicht mehr gebracht wird da du ein viel bessere besitzt und für die 900 Krogs erhältst du wirklich einen goldenen kackhaufen der nichts kann. Das zu wissen macht die Suche nach allen Krogs noch unnötiger. Und all das passt insgesamt überhaupt nicht in ein zelda Spiel; von denen erwarte ich das ich Rätsel auf der Welt löse um herzteile oder neue items zu bekommen die mir im späteren Spielverlauf helfen. Die 1020 versteckten Dinge die dir nur am Anfang etwas bringen hätte man sich sparen können. Auch die Welt hätte nicht so groß sein müssen. Auf großen wiesen gibt es außer Gegnern auch nichts was das lange reisen sehr langweilig gestaltet. Auch noch zu erwähnen ist der Schwierigkeitsgrad. Wärend du das ganze Spiel über Probleme mit zu starken Gegnern und zu wenig Waffen oder Pfeilen hast, ist der endboss viel zu einfach. Phase 1 ist noch ganz ok aber das dämonenbiest Ganon ist ja wohl das lächerlichste überhaupt. Ca. 10 Pfeile mit dem lichbogeb reichen aus um ganon zu besiegen, seine Attacken sind sehr schwach und treffen die garnicht esseiden du stellst dich mit Absicht voll hinein. Das ist alles andere als episch. Jedes kleine Kind wird mit diesem Gegner fertig. Schade eigentlich das nintendo sich selbst so in den Boden stampft.

gabeams,14-07-2020,"I need to be honest about the mechanics in this game. I'm not a fan of equipment that brokes, but it's just that. This game got a LOT of content for everyone, insane mechanics, ""sandbox"", craft and of course, it's Legend of Zelda. I can't say that was the best game I ever played, but it's on the top for sure.
As I was used to that old games with a half-open world and linear history, so was needed to take time getting used to this new style of gameplay(I didn't play Skyward Sword btw). When in the beginning I was tired doing temples, but as the game goes I was tracking and trying to find all of them. The gameplay makes you want to constantly keep doing all ""side"" tasks and even more with DLCs. And that adds even more content to the main history which also makes you want to don't give up those events, a very important factor in open-world games.
I got to be honest that the DLC schema doesn't make me comfortable, but they're ok and add some worth content in the game and gameplay.

Shenandoah,25-12-2020,"Zelda BOTW is probably the most overrated game on the Switch. Don‘t understand me wrong, the game is not bad at all, but it has some weaks, like: broke items a way too fast, repetitive world with less attractions, less towns and less NPC‘s, less diversity at all. The rare story elements did not catch me. The color tone of the game is a bit muddy and needs some more vibrant colors. I‘m also pretty sure that the game world isn‘t rendered at 1080p in dock mode, the antialiasing looks terrible. It has no option for „new game +“. The game and its extensions are too pricy 3 years after release.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hyrule is also giant, full of live and things to see and to do, a very ambitious map. The combat sistem is intuitive and easy to lear, but also deep enough and very satsifactory.

slapthefruit,29-07-2020,"It’s a good game. But I do miss the original Zelda games. This is very open world and figure it out yourself. If you like that, this is the perfect game. Unfortunately, my biggest gripe is the removal of regular dungeons. I miss having a linear story and not knowing what’s next. I don’t like being overwhelmed with the amount of choice.

bencrvr31,06-08-2020,"There are many flaws in this game, many annoying design choices. I don't like the way they handled the story at all, all of the divine beasts areas are tedious af and it's enraging to not be able to climb on those surfaces and have to do all the lame puzzles. The shrine puzzles are hit/miss, some are great, some absolutely suck. None of that is very important though when compared to how much I love the gameplay, it's just so much fun to play. There's only one huge thing I HATE about the gameplay, the breakable weapons, oh do I hate that, such a terrible idea. I assume that was to incentivize moving them through the inventory and use that cool throw thing, but it ends up meaning we have fiddle with menus CONSTANTLY in battles. That sucks so much, it comes close to ruining the rest of what is perfect about this game, but not quite. Having to change a weapon/bow/shield because it broke is annoying every single time it happens, I think about how much I hate it every single time it happens. Truly one of the worst design choices I've ever seen. But the rest of the gameplay is so good that it makes up for it to the point that I still love this game so so much. I love gliding, gathering, cooking, fighting, sneaking, all that stuff. If they put all this open world stuff into a proper linear story for BOTW2 and got rid of breakable weapons it would become the best game ever made, easily. I like linear stories, I just want to choose when to progress the story and when to do side stuff. There was no need to reinvent the wheel for this lame climax moment. The Ganon fight is lame, that was a dumb thing to make the center moment. Big cutscenes suck, nt sure how that became such a popular thing in games. I play games instead of watching movie/tv because i get to control the character. Cutscenes full of expensive animation have become so common they bore me. I hunger for control, not shiny fluff. I'm on a second playthrough and will never do the endfight. It's beautifully fun to just visit the world and wander and do stuff and maybe find something new. But I sure wish I could connect to a story from time to time and friend characters that maybe come with me sometimes. All the other ""main"" characters do their thing and then bail, they have no depth, we aren't meant to care for them. Link feels like an empty vessel here, I don't like that, I want him to be a personality, not an emptiness to fill with my identity. He should have more story and personality. They failed hardcore on all those elements in this game but they did so well with the gameplay and world making so it's ok, but here's hoping Botw 2 changes all that.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

BluntMicrocell,03-08-2020,This game is perfect in so many ways but I cannot say that the combat is perfect although it's still engaging and a challenge is always good just unexpected for a Zelda game.

Reeeb,03-08-2020,"This game is my favourite of all time. From the very beginning, Breath of the Wild feels exciting and fresh. Exploring the vast map was like nothing I've ever felt. It was a truly epic journey from start to finish. Even the music, which I had seen as a point of contention before I got my hands on it, was great. I really enjoyed the atmosphere it created and how it was serene when needed, as well as intense at other times. The Divine Beasts and Shrines were super enjoyable, a suitable switch from the typical 8 dungeon system. The towns were warm and alive, and the peaceful areas of countryside were calm and lovely. The weapon breaking system also was fine with me, leading to a variety of weapons that I used throughout my quest. This game is just brilliant. It isn't perfect, only having a 10 point system sees the score rounded up to 10. There is significant lag and frame rate drops in certain areas such as the entry to Rito Village, and at times the textures look somewhat low quality, though the graphic style is pretty enjoyable. The Korok Seeds are also quite troubling at times, with so many in the giant map, though they are optional. But overall, this game is an absolute treat that has given more character to the Zelda cast than ever before and gave the series one of it's best ever entries.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

JLord701,04-08-2020,"No piece of media is perfect. This is about as close as you can get. This is the only open world game that never felt empty to me. Hyrule was already such a magical setting, and getting to explore a bigger, better version of it at your own pace in any way you like is something that must be played. Those opening moments on the great plateau are some of the most magical I’ve experienced in any game. Who would’ve thought video game tutorials could actually be really fun. The combat isn’t some revolutionary step in game design. You COULD just target enemies and strike, but it’s much more fun to experiment with the new physics. The game lets you play the way you want, and I’ve never felt this much freedom in a game. If I had to think of some gripes, it would be the post game(no dlc). There isn’t a ton to do after defeating Ganon, but that’s sort of the appeal of the game. It lets you beat the game in any way and any order you want, so, if you beat the final boss last, this makes sense. The other gripe is the voice acting. It’s not terrible, but it’s not great. However, these in no way bring the game down. Is this an open world/action/adventure masterpiece? Is it a video game masterpiece? No. It’s a masterpiece. Period. This is my favorite video game and may very well be not only my favorite, but the best piece of media I’ve ever experienced.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

bazilali,06-08-2020,"The Legend Of Zelda Breath of the Wild is beautiful looking,beautiful sounding and beautiful experience all the way through.

The game offers alot of freedom in ways to approach it,such as you can use stealth to approach a camp and silently pick the enemies off or go in guns blazing and attack them.
The soundtrack is light and beautiful and is barely noticeable like a dash of whip cream on a cake,its perfectly placed and adds a nice bit of flavour to the cake that is Breath Of The Wild and sometimes when you discover something beautiful a haunting melody kicks in and amplifies the experience.

The combat is far more innovative that the previous games you can now parry and do flurry rushes.And different enemy types for example a fire lizalfos can die to cold weapons.

The mini dungeons however do have the same design but with a game of this scope its would be like asking for too much more,the puzzles themselves are simple enough for people and for children to play which is part of nintendos demographic.The main big puzzles (Divine Beasts) also somewhat suffer the same issue as the shrines,they look simmilar .The bosses in this game are not as exciting as previous zelda titles but they serve the purpose,with exceptions of thunderblight ganon and mini bosses like the molduga the bosses are usually shoot the eye and attack.

In Botw you can use physics to youre advantage and you can spend time thinking of new ways to take down enemies,for example using a make shift see saw and putting a bomb on it and using something as the counterweight to launch the bomb.

The story of Breath Of the Wild mainly come in the form of flashbacks and memories you can recover throught out the map,they tell a story of how zelda couldnt unlock her powers and felt like a disappointment to her father and the other zeldas and how she treated link coldly but then realized how much pressure he was under and her knight link became her friend (hopefully in BOTW 2 hes something more wink wink) now breath of the wild isnt all about the story and alot of people criticise it for it,while it may not live up to story in games like Red Dead Redemption 2 or God of War or last of us,The music,atmosphere,world,freedom and gameplay alone make this game orth playing and so my final score for this game comes to a
9.5 (must buy for nintendo switch and a console seller)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Sprixy,29-08-2020,"This is one of the best Zelda games that there is. It revamps the story and lore of Zelda to a new audience but also still making it playable for the old. Its mechanics and combat are certainly the best, and its survival elements make this game feel somewhat real. The story is also very well done and it certainly is a good telling of the classic ""Link saves Zelda "" archetype. its also simply fun to just explore or ride around Hyrule. its a beauty to gaming and also very interactable. You'll have hours of fun trying to find everything this game has to its shrines and other goods. The boss battles are also very well done as the provide a hard challenge and much skill to defeat. Moreover, you will be spending much time on defeating them. The only real flaws that exist in the game are that it feels too much in some areas. The world feels too open as its filled with many forests, mountains, and plateau landscapes. As beautiful as they are, I wish there were more towns or villages to explore, more to see and do, and more adventure to be had. some of the side quests also felt a bit less less saturated compared to the main story as they are not mainly combating oriented but rather more treasure hunting and ""find the goodie"" design. Overall however, this game is one of the best Zeldas there is. Something to definitely play and a good start to the Zelda franchise.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Coconut_,09-08-2020,"This isn't as much as a review as it is just praising this game so if you want to know what I love about this game, keep reading.

This game is something everyone must play, hands down. The music is so inspiring and never fails to suit the mood. The game is 100% what the player wants it to be. You want to grind shrines and become stronger? You can do that! You want to explore the world and make it your own, learn it like the back of your hand? You can do that too! This game is just an amazing experience. There is not one second of this game where you don't have something to do. You are constantly thinking about what is the best course of action and there isn't a ""right"" way of doing things, it gives you the tools and it's up to you to use them and craft your experience. I have about 500 hours in this game now and even 3 years later, 3 years and 8 play-throughs of this game i AM STILL learning more about the world it puts you in. I have rewatched the trailer about 1000 times and it makes me cry tears of joy. Nintendo has masterfully crafted this game as an ultimate tribute to everything that zelda is and more. It goes to what Zelda is at the root of itself and it's the exploration. You NEVER stop learning in this game. The environmental story telling and even just some item descriptions can just bring a moment of ""OHHH!!!"". Seriously everything good about open-world games and more. The combat is of course controversial but it forces you to be more sparing and more thoughtful in the way you approach a bokoblin camp or miniboss. I have never had a dull moment in this game. The soundtrack, the characters, the world, will never fail in keeping you interested. They put 110% into EVERYTHING!!! The audio, voice acting, world, shrines, koroks etc. it has all been thought of a trillion+ times. This is the best the Zelda universe has to offer, it brings in everything for this game.

Jwavey,11-08-2020,"To begin with the game had a promising start and seemed fun but as you progress disappointing and repetitive basic combat system of block or move out the way which makes the combat very boring after a few hours. As you progress through the game you realise in such a huge and vast open world game the lack of variety of different enemy’s quickly become repetitive and predictable and overall disappointing. After about 7 hours and killing the same enemies over and over again you finally find a good weapon which is probably NEVER going to be used because of the fear after about 10 swings it’s going to shatter to pieces this is something that really upset the fact that weapons and made from glass and they cannot be repair in a world full of monsters how is it no one can repair a sword????? The Devine beats bosses are super easy and makes you wonder how did champions of massive Great War machines fall to such an easy fight??? The story is plain and predictable I don’t understand the hype behind It. A monster called gannon comes every so years a goddess always defeats him until now because she in capable of activating her powers but after the whole land has been destroyed and all the champions of the Devine beast have fallen you link before you are about to be killed the goddess Predictably gains her powers and fights gannon such a simple and boring story in my opinion. All in all the game is fun to explore and the visuals are very pleasing to the eye but the combat system, weapon life, enemy variety and story all seem very annoying and lack lustre",3,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
hi_im_epsilon,11-08-2020,"This was my first open world game that I've ever completed. I've attempted playing other popular open world games like Skyrim and the Witcher 3 but their complexity was a huge barrier to entry for me. I'm not saying those games are bad at all but, for a gaming caterpillar like me, it was a daunting and exhausting effort. Breath of the Wild has incredibly simple mechanics which allows noob players to really enjoy the game without thinking they are bad at the game. However, the game allows the more serious player to learn more complex mechanics like perfect dodging, parrying, and using the environment to your advantage. None of these things are necessary but as you play the game more, you are eased into these mechanics and makes learning them much more rewarding.

The world itself is one of my most favorite aspects of the game. I'd say, at its core, this game is about curiosity and exploration. There are so many things that grab your attention as your are running, gliding, or climbing around. They all lead to some interesting and fun interactions which adds to the liveliness of the world around you. You really feel like the world is alive and independent of you. On top of this, the world design is the most beautiful and creative in any game I've ever experienced. Sometimes, I'd find myself slowly climbing to the top of a summit to be greeted with the most serene sunrise. Or I'd ride my horse around hills and just ride through a lush grassland. Pair these moments with the sparse yet beautiful piano licks and I was in another dimension. It really felt magical.

Since I was a kid, I've always been a fan of Miyazaki films for their creative and magical worlds. I think Breath of Wild pulls a lot of inspiration from them and I can firmly say that this game really made me feel like a kid again.

Play this game, it's a masterpiece.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

A pesar de ser del 2017, en mi opinión sigue ostentando la corona del mejor juego de la susodicha consola hasta el momento. Puede que sea un mundo abierto mejorable en el aspecto técnico, no esperéis un 4K ni algo muy complejo, pero hasta el momento, es el mundo abierto que mejor ha plasmado, bajo mi punto de vista, la sensación de exploración, de desconocimiento y aventura. La historia es simple, pero es coherente y muy entretenida y los doblajes ofrecen una mayor inmersión. La banda sonora es otra obra maestra, se acertó con todos los temas, que cambian progresivamente para complementar la grandísima experiencia que supone el juego.

The bosses while repetative are fun to take down and the quests leading up to them range from ok to amazing. The difficulty is something brought up alot and personally I think its perfect. From the start of the game you have a simple goal, defeat Ganon which is done by doing the other tasks. The shrines bring a new feeling to the Zelda franchise which while different, fits into this game perfectly. Every inch of the world has something in it whether it be a shrine, korok seed or a reference to other Zelda games. The world has an sense of mystery behind it as there are many ruins that are left unexplained. There are so many moments in this game where you'll find something new and exciting to do.

JediJen,05-09-2020,"Can't add too much to the already glowing reviews. It's not a perfect game but, is there even such a thing? I give it a 10 because it met and far exceeded my expectations and the value of the game has paid for itself tenfold. Combat was much to my liking with it rewarding your prowess the more you practiced and studied patterns. Not only that, three years later and this game still seems to give unlimited options on how to approach things. Exploration was put on the forefront and I spent countless hours (well 415+ according to my profile) running around and just enjoying the sights and sounds. Sound design is immaculate and I found this game just as much an aural delight as it was a visual one. Replay value is amazing as you can try different tactics and challenge yourself in a variety of ways. Nintendo didn't do anything ground-breaking on its own but somehow managed to take all the good things from other open world games and improve upon them immeasurably all in this one gem. This is game truly sets you free and the freedom it gives has likely ruined other games for me where I want to have the same freedom but will probably now feel very caged and restricted. Also, the music in this game was perfectly arranged and fit the nature and style to a tee. This is as good as it gets.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

RustyWaffle,18-09-2020,"Best game experience I have ever had in my life. Breath of the Wild is something else; way different from the other series. I got this game around 10 months ago, and I have already beat the game twice. This game definitely contains things from the other Zelda games, but one thing it has in it that makes it so good is... open world.

Now when you look at any other Zelda game, none of them are really open world and let you get to do whatever you want to. This however, is different. The open world in this game makes it SO GOOD. The map is huge; with plenty to explore and go collect all of the shrines.

Now the story is very good. From starting out at the plateau, to beating Ganon, there is a story to lead you on your way and do whatever you want between. Heck, you can go strait to Ganon if you want. There is lots of quests and little cutscenes through the game.

My favorite part were all of the villages. I loved at first exploring and finding the many villages and talking to the NPC's. I loved to do all of the side quests and the Divine Beasts. We also can't forget about the DLC.

Master Mode is great. It gives a nice extra challenge that will have you a hard time. No more Red Bokoblins or anything. Monsters and bosses also regenerate health, and that makes it even more hard.

The Champion's Ballad is also great. Finding and rebeating all of the bosses was really fun to do. You get to do mini-challenges on your way to fighting all the Blights' again. Then, you get faster regens on the powers which is nice. The One-Hit-Obliterator was also a blast. It was definitely a challenge, but it was awesome. Also the 5th Divine Beast was cool. Monk Maz Koshia was probably the hardest boss at the end. But at least you get a cool bike after you finish him.

The Master Trials are really fun. The around 50 stages are very fun and also challenging to complete. Each stage gets harder and you have to use only the resources around you.

There is so much more to this game than what I said in this simple review. Definitely worth the money and can't wait for the sequel.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

VicMackeySHIELD,07-01-2021,"Weapons system completely ruined game for me. I did give it an honest try, however (around 45 hours). Taking my time there were numerous parts of the game I loved. Graphics, storyline, traveling around, etc....were all A+. But one thing continued to nag me from the very beginning into my 45th hour - - weapons. I HATE HATE HATE how fragile weapons are. It disrupts almost all battles...even the supposedly easy ones across the countryside. And forget it if you are going up against a shrine robot boss without fully stocking your inventory with weapons. They won't last long and do little damage. Arrows are not easy to find. Cooking dishes are also a real pain in the arse. Too complicated and recipes are rare to find.

OVERALL: In conclusion, the weapons & cooking systems severely take away the fun of playing. I tried to overcome this feeling, but I've had it. Games should not be this much of a struggle. Too much dealing with weapons breaking (or recharging like the ""unbreakable"" sword)....it really cripples the game IMHO. If the next Link game has any sort of weapon degradation system again, I will be staying far away from the game. Such a shame because everything else is so good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

miritelm,10-05-2021,"Because everyone knows about the good stuff, I am going to start off with the only two things this game isn't so great in. When I started playing this game, the Sheikah Towers and the way they work were very similar to the towers in Far Cry 3 I noticed, and it disappointed me that there was a game mechanic that was similar to some other game I had already played, but that really isn't something bad. The only bad thing I have to say about this game is when there is an enemy you are maneuvering around, if there is a wall or a climbable object, you just latch on to the object and are stuck there for a bit and that lets the enemy hit you, and sometimes these objects are behind your camera therefore you couldn't even see it, and when this happened it was beyond frustrating. Other than that, this game is one of the best game ever created.

The characters, the story, the landscape the gameplay. It fits all together in a beautiful game. However, I am not a big Zelda fan, and this game has changed my opinion of Zelda a bit. The puzzles are fun and interesting and sometimes are confusing, but eventually it clicks. One thing you have to avoid while playing a game like this is looking up how to do puzzles, because the satisfaction just goes out the window. The combat in this game is also just amazing. Even after beating the game, excluding the DLC, there is still so much left to do and then you can beat it all over again in Mastermode.

I liked how customizable you could get with the actual gameplay and combat and the amount of choice and adventure it brings to the table. All of this open world stuff is not without its downsides like item grinds and having to get specific gear to do well in a specific area, but those are such minor flaws in this very polished title. Often it’s a chill, fun game but still has its challenges that may seem hard at first but can often be very rewarding and allow you to get great gear quickly while still not rushing progression. It kinda feels like a better Mario sunshine in a sense, in which the developers are testing out new things and inviting you along into those tests, but this time they feel smoother, better and more streamlined. Not to sound like Ign, but whatever kind of player you are, it has a little something for everyone.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hypey,25-05-2021,"When I think of Breath of the Wild at its zenith, I don’t imagine the challenges, the action, characters, or story. Even though these aspects helped in solidifying my rating of the game, when I imagine the title at its best, it’s always the tranquil landscapes, punctuated by a striking piano melody. In this rendition of Hyrule, everything is lost. As I traveled the land, I would be regularly reminded of what had taken place 100 years ago, the day when the kingdom lost its king and its life. The faithful day when the champions went to confront their fate, only to be met with a grim reminder of their powerlessness. The foe they faced knew how to exploit the civilization’s hubris, withholding that their technology and mastery over the beasts of legend would be enough to save them from catastrophe. Link wakes up 100 years after the faithful day, having failed in his duties, he barely understands the land upon which he walks, or his purpose. The wound is old, and this generation has forgotten the horrors of the calamity which claimed the lives of many, and so has nature. Nature doesn’t care about Ganon, it doesn’t care about lives, it just exists. As Link travels, Hyrule itself greets Link, and he acknowledges it as its own creature, deformed and corrupted by Ganon’s influence. In Link’s quest to reclaim the land, he has to first become acquainted with it. As he gathers enough Spirit Orbs to once again wield the Blade of Evil’s Bane, as he frees the Divine Beasts, and as he discovers each trial, there is always a layer of sorrow and regret lurking beneath.

In one sentence: The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s greatest achievement is in making the player grief for the desecrated land of Hyrule.

I loved exploring the beautiful areas of Hyrule, and loved seeing all of the NPC's and doing quests. I love the open world in this game, it makes it so much more fun to play. Being able to do whatever you want to do. There are some weak points to this game however. The main one I have to point out is weapon breaking. This is something that adds more of a realistic twist to the game, and I feel may make the game better in some spots. You always have to be scavenging for new tools. This makes it more fun in a way, making the player worry a bit. However, the main concept I feel lacks and I feel it just becomes more frustrating than fun/realistic, especially in the early game. The game also lacks a set story, kind of. Overall, this game is way worth the price tag. Also, get the expansion pack. It is also worth the $20.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It's boring how you have to go again and again to have the same **** of sword that gets broken after 4 kicks. It's boring to teleport and lose your horse.

Domilton,22-06-2021,"Эта игра порадовала меня на старте игры, предложив многие возможности, и я этому был рад, но потом я дошёл до сюжета игры. И был очень разочарован.

Первое что хочется отметить это квесты. Сама сюжетная линия просто отстой, состоит из пяти квестов протяжённостью 30-50 часов. Растягивали это квесты разработчики как могли, а именно принеси-подай квесты, сказать, что это самый скучный способ растянуть игру - ничего не сказать. Я даже боюсь вспоминать квест по восстановлению воспоминаний по фотографиям, т.е. приди на место которое указано на фото. Фото вроде бы двенадцать, но, побывав во всех местах, тебе дают тринадцатую, и на этом моменте у меня поехала крыша. Доп. квесты - тоже самое, принеси это, приготовь то, скажи этому. Я также упомяну, что за все эти квесты почти ничего не дают. Также игра была сделана криворукими геймдизайнерами, что я имею ввиду? А то что вещи и окружение с которыми можно взаимодействовать, не то чтобы не выделяются, но не дают понять, что их можно передвигать и тд. Что выливается в непонимание при прохождении первого чудовища, и если быть чуть слеповатым, то можно не увидеть возможность взаимодействия с ним через карту, кто понял - тот понял. Мир в этой игре действительно большой и одновременно пустой, точек интереса совсем мало, что также говорит о лени разработчиков.

Плюсы в этой игре тоже есть, но их настолько мало, что минусы с головой их перекрывают, но я о них скажу. Первое что упоминают в такой ситуации это физика игры, какая она хорошая, почти симуляция. Ну и всё.

Подводя свой итог, я хочу выразить непонимание тех игроков, что ставят 10/10, эта игра максимум заслуживает пятёрку, но не больше. Вспомните, что вы говорите, когда видите какую-то игру в которой есть такие же квесты? Как минимум чуть-чуть играете, пока не надоест и бросаете, а как максимум сразу же выключаете потому, что тратить время на такое поделие не решитесь. Так вот друзья делайте выводы сами, решайте сами, и не попадайтесь на уловки игрожуров и издательств.",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Willeee159,27-06-2021,"I don't think anything needs to be said, I mean, It's Breath of The Wild, Of Course It's Phenomenal. Sure, the story is kind of weak, especially after the amazing story told in Skyward Sword, and there has been some quality of life mods, like Second Wind for example, that has added tons of unofficial, but still amazing new content to the game, and it kind of makes the original game look pathetic. But I still love this game, It is a phenomenon that Nintendo has yet to top, It is their take on an open world game, and their answer to some of the greatest open world games of all time like The Elder Scrolls and The Witcher. This game is one of a kind, Nintendo has never made anything like it, even in Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess, with huge maps to explore, you still had to do things in a certain order and couldn't just go off and do your own thing. That's one of the best parts of Breath of The Wild, It's a true open world Zelda game. Even though your supposed to be saving Hyrule, you can just go and do your own thing, go and have your own adventure. I don't know what it is, For some reason I just love screwing around in this world, doing my own thing. The feeling I get when playing this game is unlike any I've felt before, The games music might actually play into this, It's mostly very quiet with an occasional piano note, It may sound boring, but it actually makes going around Hyrule better. It's very ambient and peaceful, The only way I can describe it is ""It's Freedom Like You Never Knew"" I feel like this game is what I've been waiting for my entire life. The feeling I get from this can be described like this, it's just like when I'm Taking a walk, On a nice afternoon, It's very quiet, no one is really outside looking at me, I'm just alone, With some wind blowing. During this time, I'm just contemplating life, and not really caring about anything. In fact, Anything could happen, This could be the calm before the storm, and any minute now, things could go from 0 to 100 in the blink of an eye, people could be coming outside, all excited and loud. There's really no other game like this, The entire game is basically the calm before the storm, one minute nothings happening, then the next monsters come out of the ground and start beating you up. The textbook example of freedom should be described as roaming Hyrule in this game, It's truly is an incredible feeling. I just love this game, It just defines who I am, I wish I could be put into the world of Hyrule in this game. I've always just wanted this level of freedom in real life, and be completely devoid of any kind of labor, like school or anything that is hard or requires insane focus and dedication. This game just speaks to me more than anyone else I know. You should absolutely play this game if you haven't, It is a delight of an experience, That is Nintendo's best work to date. And with Breath of The Wild 2 coming out next year, There's no better time to get caught up. 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

⌈多年以后，手握《旷野之息》续作时，我将会回想起第一次在海利亚大桥上见到费罗龙的那个遥远下午⌋。

《旷野之息》就是这样一款会让人在第一次启动之前要“沐浴焚香”，换上一身宽松衣服，用自己最舒适的状态来游玩的游戏，因为一旦开始，你知道接下来几天你都会与你屁股下这张沙发作伴了。

可以说，没有《塞尔达传说：旷野之息》，就没有Switch 发售时的火爆销量，乃至半年以后仍然一机难求。清新明快的卡通风格，不同区域间连贯且恰到好处的背景音乐，视野里的薄雾，让整个游戏充满着“空气感”。⌈气⌋在游戏里是活的，在旷野之中，你能看到植物和雾气随着风在摆动，你知道这是一个活的世界，每一个角落都激发着你的探索欲望。

开放世界不是把玩家扔到一个物理引擎里胡乱摸索，任天堂其实是通过地图上各种巧思暗地里引导着玩家向一个又一个目标探索，不管是闪着微光的神庙，高高耸立的传送塔还是山谷间一抹奇怪的幽光，所有看起来很自然的存在都是经过开发人员精心雕琢过的，我相信第一次见到凭空蹦出来的“呀哈哈”，所有玩家都会会心一笑吧—真有你的啊任天堂！

几年过去了，我依然会时不时跑回海拉鲁大陆去逛一逛。再站到海利亚大桥上，回想起第一次偶然见到雷龙从水面腾空而起，周遭风云变幻，悠长的音乐想起，当时真就双手止不住颤抖，心里就一个念头：这是神！",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This is something that a more forgiving game like Genshin Impact got rid of when they straight up ripped off this game, but BOTW is also not a cashgrab, pay-to-win game and is meant to make you think and problem solve. If you're looking to criticize the game, there are things you might not /like/ but then, just take a moment and consider whether those things were intentional or did they just make you have to think a little harder.

Magic_Matt,28-12-2021,"I love the enormous open world in this game that is filled with side quests and beautiful scenery.
The game never felt boring to me, there was always something to do and i was also happy that it got rid of the wallet limitations of the previous games.

The runes are an amazing addition to showcase the physics engine and are great for the puzzles in shrines and for glitches.

I didn't encounter many issues with the weapon breaking mechanic except for the limited space in your inventory and the fact that if you try to beat a hard enemy like a lynel you would just break all your weapons on the guy which made me never use my strongest weapons because ""there probably was a stronger enemy where i could need it more""
The mechanic was good for having to try other weapons, thunder and weapons catching fire was also effective in having to try other weapons.

I do not find that the story or music is bland, you just don't get forced to do the story quest as much as in previous games which I actually like because of the freedom it gives just to be able to go to Ganon as soon as you get the paraglider.

Also I find that the champions ballad DLC is a must have, the last fight that is in it is just the best boss fight i have ever done.
The other blights seemed a bit bland and easy to defeat, there are not many times where I have died because if you just cook enough food you are able to heal instantly and you can just power through every fight so you have to be one-shotted or have no food in order to die.

The only negative point I find is Ganons character is missing and seems to just be an angry pig monster like in many Zelda games.
The character that was built in ocarina of time for Ganondorf was just way better and smarter I hope we get a better Ganon in the sequel to Breath of the wild.

I can imagine people are going to be just as nostalgic about this game as people are about ocarina of time nowadays.

Overall it might be the best game I've ever played I just love open world I hope botw 2 can live up to what this game has become and that we can see Zelda in not only the cutscenes, the game is named after her after all.

patjs,31-12-2021,"To start this review off, I wanna quote Mark Serrels from CNET:
""It's been three long years since The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild rewired the connections inside my brain. It messed me up. In some ways you might say it ruined video games. Other video games. [...] Sorry, other video games. You tried, but you weren't Breath of the Wild.""

This quote sums up how I feel about BOTW quite perfectly. This game is unique, one of a kind, different. It's the best video game I've played in so many years, if not ever.

While at first, I had my doubts about how good a game like this could look or how well it could run, seeing how limited the Switch's hardware is, all of that doubt quickly washed away.
What I got instead were many weeks immersed in a beautiful game, a beautiful reality.

The game runs smoothly, the landscapes are gorgeous (you never seem to run out of things to explore and do), the combat is really fun and allows you to get really creative and the difficulty is fair for a semi-good gamer like me.

The best part imo, however, is the story. BOTW beautifully captures the ""apocalypse-like"" aesthetic in it's world and slowly recollecting all of the memories and piecing together the story pf what happened after the calamity was an absolute blast, even though it sometimes really tugged at my heart-strings (e.g. the story of the Zora/Mipha).

Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was beautiful and definitely a fulfilling one that gave me closure instead of leaving me hanging like so many other games like to do.

This game is one of the most important parts in gaming history, it really did change the gaming world. At least to me, it is more than just another open-world video game. It's an experience, and a really beautiful and intense one at that.

While I probably can't do the game and the effect it had on me justice, I hope to atleast have captured some of it in this review.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I get that the climbing mechanic is amazing but that's about it. It's basically the same story you see from every Zelda game but with 4 dungeons and a few dozen mini dungeons which get repetitive and feel like time wasters. Those 4 dungeons are fantastic but that's all their is. If that's not bad enough the weapons break after a few hits causing you to find another branch or club. The only thing in this game that's truly great is the traversal but with so few actual dungeons you basically doing the usual Nintendo trope of finding little collectibles in this case nuts. I dont think it's a bad game but absolutely don't think it's the best game ever made either. It's another game where Nintendo gets a free pass and stuff that gets points taken off from others games gets ignored in their games.

They did a good number of things right, combat is entertaining, exploring the world is great, there are numerous ways to travel at various speeds both intended and otherwise, the abilities and weapons have a lot of variety. The shrines have a number of unique puzzles.

Unfortunately, they did a hell of a lot wrong too.

They put weather that makes climbing impossible, that occasionally lasts for multiple straight days in game (two hours + real time where you're locked out of multiple game mechanics for literally no reason), in a game where 80% of your time early game is spent trying to climb things. Resting doesn't even always clear it, even if there was somewhere to reast nearby. Late game, you don't have to worry about it at all. This entire concept serves no legitimate purpose, it's an annoyance and a needless waste of time early game, and entirely pointless late game. Utter waste of time continuously fast traveling back and forth to rest repeatedly 2-10 times to clear rain so you can travel upward five feet.

Durability. Makes. No. Sense.
Seriously. The implementation is absolute garbage. ""This weapon has low durability"". So why is it in the game? To waste inventory space? Nobody is ever going to use it, partly because there's no indication of how much durability is left a la literally any game that's ever had a durability system, and partly because nobody is ever going to use anything with durability after they get the master sword because there's no durability indicators. ""But muh weapon diversity"". Congratulations. You made me use five different sticks to kill one enemy. ""Diversity"".

Motion control shrines are a horrible idea horribly implemented that are mostly just cheesed because the intended implementation was a complete failure.

When I think of beauty in videogames I think of Breath of the Wild. When I think of the essence of discovery in videogames I think of Breath of the Wild. When I think of what it means to experience child-like wonder I think of Breath of the Wild. This is the single player game I have the most time in, with over 250 hours and multiple game completions, yet I still haven't experienced everything this game has to offer, and I probably never will. I can only hope that BOTW 2 comes within a mile of this masterpiece. The best open-world game. The best Zelda game. The best game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

JohnCo,20-11-2022,"The game is totally boring and lonely, no companion, no random side quest. there is nothing special. the one thing that it presented is vast open world. Imaging that u play this game in the lonely night and u feel more lonely walking around in game, fighting some repetitive monster. The weapon break system hinder me from using strong weapon. there is no meaning of finding weapon, just pick up some easy to find weapon and the game can progress.
the design mechanic of the game is totally a trash. There are a lot of youtube videos talking about this . https://www.youtube.com/@orionc- one of the best analysis for Zelda BOTW
Game of the year just because it is a Zelda game, with big company financing all the advertisement and of course those empty-headed admirers.
there is so many bug in the so call good game physics.
Playing this game like playing some cheap sandbox game, where u walking around setting own goal, building own achievement.
Really not worth the money to buy this game. Totally regret owning this game.

raby760,23-01-2023,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a big open shallow world with no depth. It was a game where I have finished it once, and won't replay it, unlike Ocarina of Time, Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask, A Link To The Past, A Link Between Worlds, Zelda II: Adventures of Link.

- Weapons break too quickly. The fact that weapons break makes me not want to use fancier weapons unless it is for a big fight, which does not make the game fun.

- While the graphics are good, I'm not a huge fan of the Wind Waker style art design.

- Terrible story.

- Terrible voice acting during cutscenes.

- I don't like the ""wink wink"" humor, where they make references to previous Zelda games.

- Link looks feminine and he swings a sword like a girl with palsy.

- The ""snappy"" dialogue was annoying.

- I got 1/4 of the way through the game and realized the whole game is just going to be more of the same shallow boring stuff that I did to that point. I wanted lots of mega-dungeons with special items in each that would unlock parts of the map that I couldn't travel in prior to those items.

- There is no incentive to complete side quests since the reward tends to be more rupees rather than a bottle, or a piece of heart, or some item that would help in adventures.

- The Yiga story started out serious, then evolved into a clown show. The fat Yiga leader made me cringe so hard. It made me pause to soak in how the makers of Zelda stooped this low in making such a corny scene out of something that was meant to be a bit more serious.

The feeling I have is that people are blindly praising this game, blindly going along with the band-wagon of everyone else riding the hype. Maybe it would have been a good game without the Zelda name, but this is definitely not a Zelda game.

I'm an average PC gamer, playing a few hours a week only, I only recently managed to finish The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and I loved it. BOTW is more fun for me than TW3:WH because it's so easy to pick up and get something done: exploring, shrines, koroks, side quests. But the best thing about this game for me is the constant surprises even after 100h into the game(I'm at the 3rd divine beast). The side quests are varied and interesting, the characters believable(in the fantasy world they live in) and the traveling can be as fast or slow as you desire. I think that the combat is perfect as well: because the weapons break, you need to be constantly swapping weapons for the target, enemies are always challenging(blood moon helps with that) and have very interesting AI(in the way they can interact with the environment, your bombs, or use anything as a weapon). Really, there's nothing else like this game. It's got more types of gameplay and more content than any other game I've played.

The ability to traverse just about any surface and solve puzzles and problems however you like is incredibly satisfying. After 80 hours I'm still scratching the surface of the plethora of actions you can execute in the game using your many different items. The world is littered with bite size shrines and korok challenges to keep you busy for hundreds of hours. However the game is not without its flaws. The story is woefully underdeveloped and made worse by some of the weakest English voice acting in a AAA game I've heard in years. Which is only more baffling when you consider how little voice acting there is in the game. Sadly the dungeons of old are gone, replaced by more truncated and less unique divine beast levels. The world of the game, though massive, often feels somewhat empty and lifeless with the same smattering of enemies appearing again and again. I would have preferred a smaller but more dense world.

Doggy,15-01-2020,"Rarely do the modern video-games provide such non-patronizing and truly open gaming experience as the Breath Of The Wild. Seldom these days do games truly focus and run on nothing more than the players' own curiosity; their desire to explore the world and have a wild adventure.

Big words, huh? Well, I don't talk big without a good reason.
Having watched numerous, once quintessential series decline in the past decade or two, Legend Of Zelda included, I can't say I was exactly ecstatic when I first saw how this latest installment would play in practice. Too often nowadays can an experienced veteran gamer make some pretty accurate and safe predictions out of given pre-release information or the first few minutes into the game, simply because how often modern titles tend to play it ""safe"" by rehashing the popular designs. In BotW's case, the term ""Ubisoft open-world game"", down to the climbable towers and all, was the common slur people hastily used to describe the newcomer title... and at first I thought they were right.

""WRONG!"", yelled Lex Luthor. At mere hour or two into the game, I started to realize my mistake. At most, this is a wolf in a sheep's clothing. Something that merely LOOKS familiar and same-y on the surface. The freedom to truly explore ANY nook and corner, scale any wall you come across, all while having to come up with solutions for how to deal with the numerous deadly hazards of this new version of the Hyrule... this is what ""engaging"" truly means!
Then, a couple hours later, I came to realize that the first few hours were nothing more than an elaborate ""tutorial"". That beyond this already reasonably sized piece of the world map lied an even larger world. One with MORE dangers, more wonders and more exciting fun to be found.

I cannot think too many other (mainstream / AAA) games, at least from the past several years, that would strip away all artificial obstacles and walls the same way as BotW. Literally nothing else than your own lack of skill (or sufficient gear) can stop you from waltzing straight from the starting area, to the very final boss, and maybe even defeat it. At no point will the game try to stop you from exploring deadly and exotic areas, for dozens of hours, before tackling some story -missions. And very rarely is the answer to your own ""I wonder if this silly plan could work?"" a big fat ""No!"".
There's simply a ton of things to do in the BotW's ruined Hyrule, and more elaborate, simulated ""systems"" that not only keep the world feel ""living"", but that can also be exploited in numerous, even some hilarious ways.

I can totally see Breath Of The Wild being a divisive game.
However, one thing is for sure: no two playthroughs will ever play the same!
Even after hundreds of hours, I am still learning something brand new of the game, and it seems like I too keep surprising some old vets with my tales of some tricks and experiences of my own.

For 20+ years, I was certain that nothing could come close to the magnificence of the Ocarina Of Time and the Majora's Mask. Now, however, I am pleased to admit that I was wrong. Breath Of The Wild finishes this tri-force of greatest games in the history of the industry.

Hyperbole much? On the contrary!
THIS is a game that needs not only be played by everyone, but also TAUGHT in schools.
This is a video-game, all about what makes video-games so good in the first place: the gameplay.

jameson95,01-11-2020,"I more or less bought a Switch to play this game, so I was in firm belief of all the hype.

I wouldn't believe the hype. BoTW is definitely a fun game. But is it worth 9 and 10s? Not really.

It is a fun game, maybe if played it 3 years ago when it came out, I would think it was much more deserving of all the praise.

But the game basically has 4 different enemies, numerous copy and paste shrines (too many too possibly explore). Not to mention the only point in exploring is so find these irritating shrines and damn korok seeds.

BotW basically takes most of the fun out of exploring. You don't even get cool dialogue, interesting quest to learn more about the Calamity, even a cool weapon, cool skill, or anything worth while. Although you do get some pretty amazing views, and you might get to pick up an interesting mushroom or banana.

Anyways - fun game, definitely an 8out of 10.

Just a bit lacking in dialogue, character development, side plots, intrigue, humor, charisma, romance, etc, etc.

I just think that we can't let Nintendo off easy thinking in that after 20+ years they can put out the same cookie cutter, copy and paste, BS anymore.

Jorchking,07-10-2020,"A ver, como videojuego es muy bueno y largo. Pero cuando uno califica un juego es en su totalidad, y la verdad hay cosas que no puedes dejar pasar por alto:
- Port mediocre: Se supone que este era el gran plato fuerte del inicio de Switch. Es un juego que fue trabajado para Wii U pero la Switch ni siquiera puede mantener 30fps estables... Ni hablar de los bajones por debajo de los 20fps cuando estamos en los bosques o hierba alta.
- El Joy-Con drifting es donde más molesta es en este juego. Simplemente insoportable. Este juego drena la batería como una sanguijuela. No llego ni a las 3 horas con este juego.
Ahora lo que más critico del juego, quizá, es la ausencia de grandes desafíos y de una historia bien construida. La verdad es que en ambos puntos es donde más flojea el juego. Se nota la falta de mazmorras y lo de los Santuarios, lugares totalmente vacíos, no representan desafíos memorables ni de gran altura. La historia está ahí, más como excusa que como otra cosa, no tiene mucho peso para decir verdad. Y salvo por uno o dos personajes (Sidon y Mipha) se siente mucho hueco aquí.

La banda sonora está bien, y en cuanto a físicas y mundo el juego sobresale mucho. Pero siento que al juego le faltó algo más desafíos, los Centauros los sentí más desafiantes que el jefe final que fue un chiste para ser sincero. Pero en ningún momento sentí que este fuera más sobresaliente que otros juegos como Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask y, muchísimo menos, Ocarina of Time.
El juego está bien, lo empaña bastante el port, y diría incluso que tuve mejor experiencia jugándolo en emulador. Pero así y todo no es un juego que vuelva a tocar, ni un juego que me ha encantado como tal. Sólo espero que Breath of the Wild 2 lo repiense y vuelvan las mazmorras y los desafíos.

Wargears,18-01-2020,"Not going to lie but I bought a switch simply for this game and also I'm not a loz fanboy so I can give this game a fair review without the fanboy glasses clouding my judgment. I also finished the game with over a hundred of hours of playtime. Here are my pros and cons about the game.

The Good
1. The world is huge, beautiful, alive, and brimful of stuffs to discover.
2. Play the game however and whatever you want, you can even go to the final boss immediately.
3. Lots of unique and lovely characters to interact with.
4. Love how they incorporate physics in gameplay.
5. For an open world game it surely is minimal in the bugs and glitches which is always a plus for me.

The Bad
1. Although the map is huge it's full of boring empty spaces.
2. Weapons breaking immediately and no way to repair them so once your fav weapon breaks that pretty much it.
3. There are tons of towers and mini dungeons to complete but they can be repetitive after a while and the rewards aren't really great.
4. Climbing and rain nuff said.
5. Enemy variety are pretty small and some harder enemies are usually just color swapped with weaker ones.
6. The horses in this game sucks and you're better off just walking.
7. Combat is pretty average to be honest.

My grade for this game is an 8/10, it's a great game but still far from being a masterpiece and there are still a lots of areas to improve upon which I hope botw 2 will address. Still this is a must buy game for the switch and I highly recommended it even if you're not a fan of the zelda franchise.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jadam914,14-06-2018,"There is plenty of content to explore and interesting things to do in this game. Lots of thought went into the making of this game, which is evident with all the puzzles and hidden things to find. Just the interactions with the monsters, animals, and the environment are interesting and comical at times. I would give this game a perfect score however it has frame drop issues from time to time in different areas. The Switch it self is mostly to blame but the game should have been optimized better so that did not happen. It's not a wide spread problem through out the game but noticeable at times and slightly detracted from my enjoyment of the game",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
mileafly,01-12-2019,"Breath of the Wild is a hard game to review, because there is much to love, but I also feel that there are even more annoyances and design faults that take away from what could have been truly fantastic. Some disclaimers first, I am a huge Zelda fan and have played all games in the series, and Breath of the Wild is a huge game, and even though I have played at least 30-40 hours so far I am not even half way through the main quest (maybe not even 1/4 through). If there is one thing to say about the new Zelda it is that it is truly a huge game.

Now, the fact that the new Zelda game is so huge is both a positive and a negative. The game world is truly vast, and the views you can see when climbing up a high mountain in the game can be truly breathtaking. Every area you see (as far as I know) you can get to, and most of the time you can see all areas of the game in the distance while you are traveling and it is great in that aspect. Here is also one of the problems with the game though, it often feels like this is Nintendos first atempt at a truly open world game, and that they think that the bigger the better. The problem here though is that while the world is truly huge, there is very little to do in this vast area. Mostly it is just a long travel to the next area. Occasinally you will find things like stables and shrines etc, but more often there is just rolling empty hills. And here show much of the uneven feeling in this game also, there are moments when things really look super great and well designed, and other times I got the feeling that some areas felt like some plain random generated terrain, I almost felt sometimes like being in a beta version of a game, or how things can look when you glitch outside the map in some game and the terrain continues but without all the details.

My problem is not with the vast world in itself though, my main problem is that there is no real motivation to do things there or any real sense of progression. Sometimes almost all open world games of this type have is a solid progression system, often in the shape of a leveling system where you go out in the world to do things, clear quests and defeat monsters to gain xp and levels and then develop your character and make him stronger. In Zelda this is all thrown out of the window, and instead nothing you do matters so much for your progression of your characters (besides clearing shrines that can make you increase the number of hears you have, or your stamina). Even worse is that most of the equipment you have is destroyed after a few uses in the worst equipment system I have ever seen I think. There is no thrill in seeking out and finding a great weapon, since after you have hit with it for about 20 times it will be destroyed, it is extremely annoying, the same goes for your shields and bows. The only permanent equipment you have is your armor (which is extremely rare to find). This also makes fighting enemies feel like a shore and a punishment, there is no point in fighting monsters since they rarely have anything of use, you don't get any xp for killing them like in other games and you will end up destroying your weapons int he process.

The other ""big thing"" in the game is the crafting of food and elixirs. If this had been done right it could have been a great motivator to go out in the world and explore, but most of the crafting feels useless and you rarely need to dabble in it. I could imagine how fun it would be to explore the big world if they had a system like in monster hunter etc where you gather things to create stronger gear etc, (that is not destroyed in 20 hits). They needed something that motivated you to just want to go out and explore on your own to build your character, but they failed misserably in this area and it is the games biggest flaw.

There are so many areas of the game that just does not feel well thoughtout, another really annoying thing is the constant requirement to go into the paus menu to do things like throw away weapons etc, especially when swapping for new weapons is such a huge part of the game. Also the crafting system is really tedious with the requirement of constant pausing.

It is a shame, because there is such a gem hiding beyond all the filth.

EDIT: After replaying the game years later on Master Diff I have decided to give the game a 9. It is much more fun when harder. There are still tons of faults though that prevent the game from getting a 10. The annoying beeping sound when having the shrine finder (why can't I just turn off the sound??), the Shadow of Colossus style stamina bar made pointless when you can just drink stamina potions so climbing is never an accomplishment, pausing whenever and healing making fights too easy, pathetic rewards for quests or in chests that give zero feeling of reward where you are better off just avoiding enemies instead etc etc. Again it is a shame is has all these flaws, because at is core it is such a grat beautiful game.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

MistahJuicyBoy,18-06-2019,"My vote for the best game ever made. However, it's really difficult to explain why it is so good. If you look at Metacritic, reviews are either very negative, or perfect. If exploration and combat are your thing, this is a 10. There aren't linear paths like in previous games, no items locked behind achievements; if this is the type of game you really like, there is none of it here.

My advice for its enjoyment is that you should go in with no expectations and let the game wow you. If you go in expecting to be impressed beyond your wildest dreams, the game will feel... too calm. It's best enjoyed while relaxed.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

memus,06-10-2019,"Yesterday I finally killed Ganon. It took me only 2 years and 115 hours of gameplay to do it :)
It's a marvellous game. Switch isn't a perfect hardware to render huge open-worlds. But this is totally fixed by a perfect art direction. This is a very beautiful game and a mesmerising world.

+ This is the first open-world game where I enjoyed exploring it and finding secrets by myself.
+ OCD Korok seeds quests are amazing
+ Monks in shrines are such an awesome and unexpected reference to Buddhism
+ You know where the Ganon is straight away
+ The first walk up to Zora domain in rain
+ Air battle with Naydra
+ Fairies that are too sexy for a kid friendly game :)
+ Labyrinths!

- Loading times are not the best
- Frame rate drops in Korok forest
- Final battle with Ganon was beautiful, but meh
- In general, after the early game the horse became more a nuisance than fun",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bulger_paul,21-08-2017,"Breath of the Wild is a truly impressive game for a lot of reasons. It's beautiful, occasionally breathtaking, and the music is muted, melancholic, and serene (which is a departure from the more heroic sounding music in previous Zelda games). Though I'm not exactly sure I understand the numerous perfect score reviews, because it really isn't a perfect game, with several flaws that kept me from being completely, 100% enraptured in it, even though I absolutely loved every minute of it. But since anybody reading this has already heard of the many, many many, many wonderful things found within this game, and there's no need for me to go through explain them in any detail, I'll just spend my time noting the things I wasn't particularly fond of.

First off, weapon fragility systems can go straight to hell. I find the weapons, shields, and bows breaking after 20 or so hits to be annoying. It's not as annoying once you get used to it, but it's still something that's always just there, lingering in the background, and it keeps me from becoming fully immersed in the combat, because after every 15-30 seconds worth of combat, I have to pause the game, and pick a new weapon to use for another 30 seconds before I have to pause the game again. It doesn't really present any added layer of challenge, it's just an incessant nuisance you constantly have to keep breaking your immersion in the game to deal with.

Second, most people are going to disagree with me on this one, but the open world is way too big for what few main quests there are in the game. Like I said, most people will disagree with me here, because it's more to do with personal taste than anything necessarily wrong with the game, but I'm not a big fan of open worlds that give you no conceivable reason to explore all, or even most of it, other than for the sake of exploration. I need more than that to keep me invested in a game. This is a beautiful world, frothing with secrets, and puzzles, all lovingly designed, but there's only four dungeons (discounting the multitude of shrines) and then there's nothing that's particularly compelling left to do other than fight Ganon. The full scale dungeons, which happen to be the main reason I play Zelda games, are breathtaking, and their sheer scale is so impressive, but I was incredibly disappointed to find out there was only four of them, and I felt there was no other compelling reason to keep exploring Hyrule, and discover its secrets after I had finished them. I just feel as though there wasn't enough main quests or compelling enough rewards to fill out the colossal size of the map, outside of for the sake of discovery, which has never been a great motivating factor for me and video games.

And third, which will be the last major thing I express disappointment in is the final fight with Ganon. It's neat, but I was way too overprepared for it. With all of the buildup that led up to that fight, it was surprisingly disappointing. I was hoping for a sprawling, multi-regional, tooth and nail clash that would test all of my knowledge learned from getting to know the landscape, the rules, and the physics of this world, and would strain all of the resources I had been collecting and saving for this final strength testing moment, where I would put to use all of the guardian powers I had been collecting, etc etc etc, but it was done in about six minutes, tops, and it lacked a certain sense of epicness, and accomplishment after I had finished it. Final bosses in Zelda games have always been a bit hit or miss with me. Some are spectacular, epic show down set pieces that can consume up to an hour, others are sort of abrupt and feel tacked on. The epic scope of Hyrule in this game, along with the sheer scale of the four guardians, primed my expectations for a showdown that I never really got.

There are other very small things I could keep going about, like the weak voice performances, but I don't want to sound more negative than I truly feel, because this is honestly one of the best games I've ever played, and I loved every minute of it, even though I wish some things about it were different. It will easily consume 90+ hours of your life before you even realize it.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
chr1so,21-10-2019,"While not a perfect game, the open world created here is a thing of beauty and the game makes you want to explore so much of it. It's so easy to get immersed in it all. 50 hours just went like that.
I thought I'd hate moving away from the more linear structure of other zelda games but it's done really well here. I also like the fact that landmarks aren't on the map already, you need to mark it yourself.

There's a couple of things that are annoying, like the rain & thunder, the cooking (which additionally makes bosses easy as) and the fact your weapons break so quickly, making you just avoid enemies, but overall you can't rate this game lower than an 8 given the sheer enormity of it without any filler (besides maybe some fetch quests which aren't necessary).

NikoBocce,04-12-2018,"Breath of the Wild is Nintendo's swing at the open world genre, using one of their most recognizable IPs ""The Legend of Zelda"". In terms of scope and size Breath of the Wild is Breathtaking (Pun Intended), the dynamic locations, cultures, and areas are truly something to be admired and praised. BotW also includes several callbacks OoT in locations and music. The gameplay is also a step forward, opting for a controversial yet innovative durability system for the weapons, shields, and bows. The graphics and art style are also unique and look great for a handheld experience. The story also has many moments that are tear-jerking and emotional. As an adventure game BotW works on many levels, innovating from the traditional Zelda gameplay and tropes.

However, BotW is not free from criticism as there are numerous flaws that appear the longer the game goes on. The first glaring issue is the music, from a series that has created some of the best soundtracks in the industry; BotW opts for a more minimalist approach and in my opinion, it doesn't work at all. While older Zelda games have memorable jingles and melodies, BotW comes off as boring and lethargic. That's not to say the entire soundtrack is garbage, some battle scores are quite good. It's just that a large amount of the soundtrack is unforgettable and lacks in character. The story while admirably non-linear in its approach, is also lacking on several levels. It seems that most of the impactful moments in the story happened 100 years before Link was awoken at the beginning of the game. Some characters are interesting, and Link's dead girlfriend is certainly worth a mention. However, the cast of characters presented here are a step back from the other past titles in the series. This brings me to my largest critique the overworld. BotW's progression system is based on shrines which are scattered across Hyrule, there are 120 in total. The issue with these shrines is that they all look the same in design. Instead of a colorful thematic dungeon design, these shrines are aesthetically the same and after 5-6 of them, they begin to feel like an absolute drag. With this large interesting landscape, the lack of things to do and activities inhabiting it, turns the large expansive world of Hyrule into one large, uninspired, sandbox. While that might seem a little harsh, I do believe that this game and concept is one that should absolutely be built upon. There is a 10/10 game hidden somewhere inside here, I'm just not seeing the perfect masterpiece everyone else is.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
FreedomFighters,05-03-2018,"Any gamer that's been on the internet knows that it took four long, daunting, arduous years for Nintendo to release this much-anticipated and much-ballyhooed ""The Legend of Zelda"" title after properly announcing it. We first knew it was happening in January 2013, but we didn't see legitimate gameplay of it until June of 2014 at E3. And while we were blown away by what we saw, Nintendo was mum about the game throughout 2015, showing no gameplay during the year, delaying the game several times, and notoriously not showing it at their E3 press conference, even though the game had once been slated to launch in 2015. By the time we finally got decent footage of this vaunted Wii U ""Zelda"" title, the Switch was on the way and the game would serve as a launch title for Nintendo's new console. This added to the overall pressure of the game: there's the pressure to be really great, the pressure to live up to the ""Zelda"" name, and now, the pressure to give gamers a reason to go out at launch and buy themselves a shiny, new Nintendo Switch. It was scary, yes, but Nintendo, with far more poise than they showed throughout any of the Wii U's years, fearlessly took the new ""Zelda"" title in several directions, and we ended up getting a game that may well be one of the best in the company's storied history.
""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" really is all about exploration: the amount of freedom in the game is absolutely incredible, the open-endedness of the gameplay is magnificent, and the fact that you can play however you want to is brilliant. Hell, I spent 30 hours on the game, defeated the Divine Beasts and Calamity Ganon, and I had only completed 6.78% of the game by the time all was said and done. Nintendo really packed this one with a lot of content, and beyond all of the great things to explore, the visuals are top-notch (even in handheld mode), the story, though still a ""Link must defeat Ganon"" ordeal, actually adds a bit more emotion to the game as a whole, and the voice actors do a fine job. I'll admit, it's obviously not an easy game, and it's not a short game, which might discourage some, but I'm telling you, this is a game you absolutely have to witness first-hand. ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" is easily one of Nintendo's greatest, most-polished, and most exciting games, and it's another achievement in the studio's long history. It definitely made a statement being a launch title, letting everyone know of the types of experiences they'll be getting with the Switch, and beyond making that first impression, it's an absolutely brilliant game. Do give it a shot, you really should.

DemKin,14-04-2020,"What a game. Huge, gorgeous, smart, addicting,... I find myself diving in for 6+ hrs sessions, and I still have to force myself to leave the game and take a break because I just wanna keep playing, keep exploring, keep experiencing this beautifully-crafted massive world.
While it clearly changes a lot on many aspects from the previous 3D Zelda games, the identity of the series, its charm, is everywhere, the world is brimming with subtle poetry and epicness. And I can't keep a straight route too, I just keep getting distracted every 10 seconds by something new, some new puzzle, quest, ennemies, scenery.
The design is top notch, it doesn't get any better than that, the puzzles are very clever, diverse, and keep surprising, the feeling of getting more powerful is present more than ever in the series...
Definitely a game you have to experience for yourself, I seriously doubt it can leave anyone unfazed. It just keeps giving. What a game.

EDIT ( 4/14/2020 ) : currently rediscovering this game after 3 years, playing it in Expert mode (tough to say the least), lately I was feeling nostalgic about this game, only 3 years after I've completed it! It's a first for me. So yeah, without a doubt, a very special game. Today's kids will remember BotW like we remember OoT. Lucky them :)",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
HugoStiglitz,27-02-2018,"I'm giving it a 9/10 so far, and I still think Horizon is the better game based on its combat and story and it's more linear nature (a good thing IMO, some times open world games are too open IMO) but wow, Zelda is incredible. I might change my opinion after I've beaten it though. I enjoy the story, I just hope it goes somewhere aside from what's totally predictable. I'd love to see an epic ending for this epic game but we'll see.

All the haters giving bad reviews are so stupid it's really hilarious. You can't even get mad about it, that's how dumb they are. No one agrees with them besides.

Also the comments about this having bad graphics show the complete ignorance most gamers have when it comes to graphics. It's like they're blind. The deal with BoTW is yes, it does have last gen textures, and relatively simple geometry, but it absolutely excels when it comes to lighting and atmospherics. The lighting and atmospheric effects are far beyond anything in last generations. Much like the Last Guardian. Pretty much the same exact story with that game graphically. Another gorgeous game where all people can do is look at a texture and proclaim the graphics are bad. That's not how graphics work.

Hate to break it to these people but lighting always has, and always will be far more important than textures. You could use the most detailed textures, and photo grammetry techniques to produce a ridiculously detailed game, but without quality PBR shaders, global illumination, ambient occlusion, shadowing and bounce light, it would look as flat as a PS2 game.

Uncharted 4 isn't the best looking game in the business because of its textures, it's because of its lighting. Same with GT Sport. Zelda looks gorgeous you morons.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

elterrible,02-09-2019,"I really wanted to love this game, I Really did! However, I found there was too much open space and not enough tasks or actions to fill out the adventures.

Also, what there is to do, is incredibly repetitive at times. Literally, shine after shrine had only small variations at best and in many ways it was a lot like the telephone game, where the variation of the shrines change slowly as you advance through them.

Another thing that I found clever and also annoying were the elements... Lightning always got you if you had any metal on at all! Cold would kill you if you didn’t have a torch or a jacket (a jacket that your buddy gives you only after you’ve struggled to complete most of the early tasks in the opening portions of the game.

Honestly though, I didn’t find the load times to be too bad, but I did find that Zelda was a serious battery killer for the original switch and that also lead to some frustrations as I typically played the switch when I was out on the road (Maybe I’ll play it again on the new switch and see if some of my frustration goes away with the improved battery life).

Now, if you’re a Zelda fan from the way back, you will likely give this game 1 or 2 points higher than I did, but for me, Super Mario Odyssey is the best game on the platform. So, with that said, if you weren’t all that into early versions of Zelda, you should probably look at other games before buying this, or you might hate the switch.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Whutupribs,15-03-2017,"Zelda: Breath of the Wild is... Well, it's hard to put into words. I don't need to tell you that it's a good game; the glowing reviews that it's gotten nearly across the board can speak for that. What I can tell you is that it has managed to breathe new life into a series that even I, as a life-long Zelda fan, was starting to see as stale and repetitive. It's as though Nintendo took all the best parts of previous Zelda games and combined them into one: it's got the massive world that Wind Waker had, the interesting and varied environments from Ocarina of Time, and the open-endedness of the original Legend of Zelda. The puzzles both inside and outside of the shrines are diverse, reasonably challenging, and sometimes downright tough. The open world lends itself extremely well to a Zelda game, which surprised me. I was skeptical from day one, but Nintendo definitely delivered. It's like they took the size of the world from Wind Waker and filled in all the boring sailing with things to keep your attention. Every area of the map feels interesting and alive, which is something few open world games can boast. There's plenty of weapon and armor variance, and you always feel like exploring is worth your time. It captured the feeling of adventure in a way that the series has been sorely lacking since Ocarina of Time. All I can really say without delving into all the things you've already heard from other reviews is that if you're a fan of the series, even a casual fan, you will love this game. I bought a Switch just to play it, and I don't regret it a bit.

That being said, this isn't to suggest the game is without it's faults. There are some rather glaring issues that I had with the game, which is why I haven't given it a 10/10. First and foremost is the one thing everyone has been complaining about: the weapon durability mechanic. Now, I think a lot of people made this more of an issue than it is, because you do eventually adjust to it and learn how the game is balanced in this regard. It doesn't make the game less enjoyable so much as it was a missed opportunity to make the game even MORE enjoyable. The simple inclusion of a way to repair weapons with rupees and materials would have gone a long way towards improving this mechanic. The durability system wouldn't have suffered, mostly because you're always finding weapons with different properties. I like the idea of having to use different weapons for different scenarios, but it could have been executed much better. The armor system, while varied, is a little lacking as well. Most of the time, with the exception of a few scenarios, I found myself annoyed that I had to use inferior armor. One could make the case that this was intentional to make certain areas more challenging, but the inclusion of an enchantment system would have been really a great way to mitigate some of this annoyance. The third and final issue I have is sort of twofold: the climbing. The climbing is so incredibly tedious that it actually made me angry a few times. Granted, there are ways in-game to improve the speed and effectiveness of climbing, but that only makes it slightly more tolerable. That, coupled with the fact that rain storms make climbing almost impossible, and it can be really frustrating and slows the pace of the game a lot. Had they fixed these few things, this game would easily be a 10/10, and would likely be considered one of the top 5 Nintendo games of all time, right up there with the original Mario and Zelda games.

I don't want these things to discourage you; this game is absolutely incredible and well worth every hour I've put into it. I'd absolutely consider it the best Zelda game since Wind Waker, and maybe even the best since Ocarina of Time, if you can manage to remove the nostalgia filter. Long story short, it may not be as absolutely perfect as many reviews are claiming, but it is an incredible game, and it's exactly the direction Nintendo should have taken, both as a company and for this franchise.

So just to recap: It's typical good AAA game of our times, but poor Zelda game. Period.
Imagine ""Link to the past"" overworld without dungeons moved to modern 3D aesthetics. That's exactly this game. Good exploration game, poor in terms of being Zelda game.

""Forget all you know about Zelda game..."" - I thought that was just marketing. Oh boy... No, they were just honest with us.

And all these 10/10... Really? How can you give 10/10 score to a game that was intended to have mini map on gamepad, but eventually had this feature disabled on the release (remember 2014 wii u demo? Just compare). Meaning automatically that current BoTW cannot be perfect right now, because we have seen better ""more perfectish"" BoTW with minimap on youtube! Logic? Who cares.

Right, ""Big N"" will sell anything with right marketing. In my opinion Zelda has gone simply in wrong direction. With BoTW, our good old Zelda just made transition to another polished corporate product without soul. That's prolly what modern consumer expects, but not necessarily Zelda fan.

Combat is limited with basic swing sword, or shoot arrow. Enemy difficulty is weird. The lynel's are tougher than ganon.

luque,11-11-2018,"Breath of the Wild é marcante em diversos aspectos. Para a franquia, este décimo nono título representa um paradigma: ele traz e também exige de seus jogadores uma nova racionalidade que, até então, encontrava-se atada à fórmula que historicamente fazia a justa fama angariada pela série. Essa racionalidade é manifesta principalmente pela liberdade com que Link segue com sua jornada, liberdade que termina por ressoar no tempo necessário para que cada player complete o seu jogo, ou mesmo no quão volumoso o seu inventário estará para os momentos derradeiros dessa história. Mas é claro que, para inovar, foi necessário que Breath of the Wild abrisse mão de antigos acertos, como se nota, por exemplo, em sua discreta trilha musical que, mesmo narrativamente apropriada, pode provocar um sentimento amargo para aqueles que associam Zelda à sua musicalidade épica.
No que respeita à Nintendo, Breath of the Wild representa um ponto de partida excepcionalmente promissor quanto à sua tentativa de erigir uma sólida base instalada para o novo Nintendo Switch, assim como para encerrar, com um último suspiro, o fracasso histórico que permeou o velho Wii U. Para a indústria, o jogo curiosamente representa a manifestação de um novo padrão de qualidade, especialmente no que tange ao polimento de seu gameplay e à naturalidade com que o seu vasto universo nos convida investigar cada detalhe que se faz presente em sua diversificada geografia.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MaximumD,06-10-2020,"I finally picked up a switch after all these years and picked up BOTW, MarioKart, and Smash Brothers. The 3 quintessential Nintendo games. Since then I've barely touched Mariokart and Smash Brothers because I've been absolutely hooked on Zelda. This is definitely the best Zelda game I've played since the Snes days. I would say there are only 2 negatives for me with this game, which are actually design decisions and not actual flaws:

first, the weapons simply break too fast. This is alleviated immensely with extra slots when you progress, but it's still very annoying when you run out of weapons and shields against a tough enemy. I always found myself hoarding good weapons for those surprise encounters against a Lynel or boss fights. I think a better system would have been to let us repair those weapons with stuff we find in the world, same as upgrading armor. Also, why doesn't the armor break? It doesn't make sense. But say you have a wodden Boko bow, you should be able to repair it using wood and Boko parts. Simple.

Ok Second, I love climbing around and I have no problem with the stamina wheel. But good God man to whoever decided that you can't climb during rain. I can't count the times I had a long tough climb, chugging elixirs all the way, getting right to the end and failing cuz it started to rain. LOL. This freaking happened all the time to me and I would go ape **** Seriously.

So that's it. The rest of the game is flawless. It sucks you in so bad you will not be able to put it down. It's the best open world game ever made. There is literally something to find in every corner of the world, which is huge. There are so many side quests and little missions to complete, I honestly don't know if I'll ever finish 100%. You can have a goal when you start playing only to get side tracked exploring some interesting areas and find hours have gone by.

Plus, this is one of the only games where the rules of the world totally make sense, so if you just think logically and try something it probably will work. Like the first time I realized that metal chest at the bottom of a river can simply be picked up with the magnet power. LOL, I spent at least half an hour trying to get that chest, and then it just dawned on me. I just got the magnet power right before this and sure enough I was able to latch on to the chest and pull it out of the water. LOL, I felt so dumb. That's just one example though. This game's puzzles are completely logical and it does not hold your hand, but let's you just work things out. I find that respect for the gamer very gratifying.

Kudos to Nintendo for making this masterpiece. It's amazing and almost perfect. Best game i've played in a very long time. I really hope Nintendo puts out the sequel soon and also really want a new Metroid adventure. Nintendo = Quality over Quantity always.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

MetaRogue,20-09-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the current definition of perfection - a critic who gives it anything less than a 10 out of 10 would be committing a crime against nature, and ultimately a sin against video games as an art form. Words like 'masterpiece' and 'perfect' are not enough to describe it's impact upon popular culture and gaming culture. It has effortlessly established itself as Game of the Year for 2017 and as one of the greatest games of all time.

It is also the only game in recent years that has come very VERY close to usurping Ocarina of Time from it's much coveted status as 'The Greatest Game of All Time'. The only difficulty Nintendo faces now is trying to make something better.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It has many obvious flaws, which frustrates me quite often when I was playing, but the attraction is also strong. The 9 I gave is more like 15 - 6, where the 15 is how good the right things they did, and 6 is how bad the flaws are.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

There simply isn't anything that this game does wrong. The combat is responsive and satisfying without being a total cakewalk. (You'll probably die a few times, and when you do, it's deserved.) The open world is dense enough to warrant its size, and exploration is heavily rewarding. Many of the greatest weapons I've wielded during my ~75 hours with the game came from solving puzzles or finding chests that weren't blatant and required experimentation to uncover or complete. This game is the reason Nintendo is still relevant. Its design is flawless, and that's coming from someone who's first Zelda game was Breath of the Wild. Buy this game.

elv45236,27-09-2017,"If you purchased a Nintendo Switch, you should absolutely get this game. That is the bottom line. I have dug over 110 hours into this game, completing the story mode in 95 hours. In my first play through I discovered all shrines, all divine beasts, obtained the Master Sword, obtained the Hylian Shield, and of course defeated Calamity Ganon.

I have begun Master Mode; however, I don't feel I need to complete it in order to write this review. This game quickly became one of the best games I have ever played all time. The amount of flexibility granted to the player is astounding. It is possible to run directly to the final battle right after the small tutorial area. The entire world is opened up to the player almost immediately. This is a true open-world game which is rare to see.

One of the things I really did not like about the game is the destructible weapons. I would have preferred to have a method to repair weapons before they got destroyed. Having them just break without any way of restoring them was just counterproductive. This complaint did not stop me from enjoying the game, I only wished it were different.

PrimalBanana,17-10-2017,"The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is finally with us after years of waiting and it’s quickly become my favourite game of all time, surpassing even Red Dead Redemption. Now, I haven’t played every Legend of Zelda game nor am I a massive fan but it’s a series I’ve enjoyed in the past and I love the passion that fans have for it. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild has been in development for a long time and people have been excited for it since we caught our first glimpse of it years ago at E3. A lot of open world games these days give you a vast open space that often feels empty and void of fun. Too often we are treated as incompetent and led through a series of dull and boring tutorials. Worse still, many open world games have side missions and collectables scattered throughout, purely as filler content rather than being placed thoughtfully and with any meaning. This is a trap that Nintendo avoids convincingly. The bar for real and meaningful open world gameplay has been raised by the developers of The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild and better yet they don’t simply introduce what they can think you can handle in little pieces. They first give you the plateau to acquaint yourself with the game and introduce the story but beyond that the world is yours and you can feel the developers almost daring you to head out into the unknown. I really can’t overstate just how beautiful this game world is. Quite simply, it is the best and most beautiful game world I have ever played in. It’s not just a work of art but it is a masterpiece. The story compliments this game world and is told through a series of flashbacks. I’ve found the story interesting and capable of holding my interest even when side tracked by exploration, hunting or faced with one of the many engrossing side quests. I won’t spoil it for you but the combination of good narrative, character design and the beautiful game world draw you in and once you are in its grip you won’t want to put it down. There are Shrines for you to find and explore and you can do this in any order you wish without interfering with the story. You will need to complete puzzles and get your thinking cap on. Some are easy, some are tricky whilst others will have you scratching your head. In all cases, I’ve found them enjoyable. To get the map for the area you are in you need to scale the many towers and even that’s not always as straight forward as it first seems. When you start visiting these towers you start to appreciate just how big the game world is and how much content there is within it. Content is the key word here because I can’t stress just how much there is. There are 100 shrines, Kokri Kids to find, creatures to photograph for the games compendium, villages to discover, god knows how many side quests and enemy camps. The scale is staggering yet it never felt daunting. I never found myself rushing to complete task after task. You find yourself allowing the game world to distract you and you move along enjoying every minute. You are never told that you must do one thing over another and you are always left to figure out what you are meant to do. I’ve seen a number of articles on other sites offering to guide you through the game and reveal it’s secrets. I can’t stress enough how you should avoid these articles as they will completely ruin the experience for you. Learn by playing and enjoy the game at your pace. It will be a long time until this game is surpassed so you may as well make it last. As well as being beautiful The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is brutal. I don’t think I’ve ever died so much in a Nintendo game. Weapons, bows and shields are all perishable and health is replenished by eating meals. It’s up to you to cook up these meals from ingredients you find in the game world and this in itself is something that’s a diction and enjoyable to do. Combat can be a good challenge and I’ve found myself bravely withdrawing from a number of battles I know I couldn’t win without using up a large portion of my resources. You find yourself weighing up the potential gains from any encounter, against the potential cost to your resources. It’s not just the critters that can be lethal though. Sometimes the weather can become your enemy with lightening storms proving shockingly lethal. Swimming in the rivers and lakes can be just as deadly if you don’t manage your stamina. Breath of the Wild is without doubt the best game I have ever played and justified buying the Switch on day 1. The sheer variety of gameplay on offer as well as the game world and engrossing story mean that Nintendo have made the greatest game ever to release.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

bskierys,08-09-2019,"My real score is 8/10 + 1 because of how well it is to play that game on a handheld console.
The game is best described as the title itself - A Breath of the Wild. It has a story of saving the kingdom the evil forces but the story is not really engaging. The real pleasure is to get lost in the beautiful world of Hyrule. The game has a unique way of guiding you through the world. You will see very few map markers but the quest are rather constructer to give you guidelines on how to get to a point of interest. It is so well done that the search itself is in most times better than what you find in the end.
To give you an example: You meet a little girl that tells you a story about her grandfather who climbed a nearby mountain. At the peak, he has found a white bird and in his belly, there was a treasure. So you go to your map where you find out where this mountain is. You climb to the top of it only to find out that you see no birds there - at least there are no white ones. You look carefully to see that one valley that is covered in snow is in the shape of a bird. When you go there you see that there is a large pit in the middle with the shrine in it. There you are - you have found the treasure. And this is just one of the many many riddles and adventures that you can find in Hyrule.
It is great to play that game on the handheld. I have been playing it on a plane, in a tent during my vacation and on the sofa while my wife was watching TV. Breath of the Wild is great to play it 2-3 hours a day after a hard day at work. The best moments are when you decide to go to a new region and you just get lost there in search of shrines.
On the other hand, it completely loses its charm when played in a docked mode in longer sessions. After playing it for a while longer, it feels... empty. The story is not well told, most of the side quest are just fetch quests. Nothing feels deep and you find yourself traveling from one point to another only to spend there a few minutes. Sure, the road is great but the lack of depth of tasks and characters can really kill the mood.
Oh, and I hated the soundtrack. It is repetitive to the point that after 130+ hours of the game I felt super sick of it.
One last thing is how well-designed mechanics in that game are. I don't want to write too much about it but every mechanic feels to be exactly in place. Temperature, Stamina, Weather - everything feels to be completing one another. And discovering how one mechanic interacts with the other is part of the fun as the game just does not tell you that.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kamhagh,23-02-2018,"The last time I enjoyed something this much was when I first played world of Warcraft. Although I played that game for 2 years before stopping :P this is one of the best games of my life. sadly I finished it in 55 Hours. And the end boss is very disappointing. It's increasingly easy too.

The dungeons are a bit similar and the story is lame, But the game is so amazing that with all the flaws it has I'll still give it a 10!

I played it on an emulator though. At 2560x1440 15fps~ and mods! But I thought it was reallllly beautiful! Words cannot describe how beautiful I think this game is with the clarity mod anti aliasing and 2560x1440 resolution c: it's one of my favorite Looking games!
I still wish you could skip things easier specially for the master mode....

Also this is the only game that I can play for more than 2h before I feel awful. And One day I played it for 7h... that's a lot... for me atleast..... But I'm sad that it was way too easy and finished way too fast for me!

Rangaman,21-08-2017,"A masterpiece and a breath of fresh air for a stagnant franchise, Breath of the Wild is easily the best Zelda game since Majora's Mask.

The good:
-Exploration is fantastic
-The open world is legitimately massive and easy to get lost in
-The shrines are fun, discovering them feels good and they don't slog like the dungeons in previous 3D Zeldas
-The combat is great fun
-The NPCs are memorable
-The atmospheric soundtrack is great on the ears...
-...and it helps the orchestral moments stand out that much more
-The art style is awesome
-The organic nature of the game

The Meh:
-The boss fights can be a bit clunky
-Some of the side quests are boring grind-fests
-The voice acting is bizarrely ""up-and-down"" in terms of quality
-The story is simple and the ending feels quite anti-climactic

The Bad:
-Every weapon is made from paper-mache
-The voice acting isn't full voice acting (it only plays during story-important events). All or nothing, you guys.
-The awesome-looking final boss is a joke, and a bad one at that.

Overall, I'm excited to see where the series goes from here. While the story elements are lackluster overall, I'm willing to bet that this will be addressed in future games. Still a fantastic game for what it's worth.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kyle20ellis,19-03-2022,"I enjoyed the 3D games such as Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Twilight Princess; however, I also found them to contain flaws. Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess I found the dungeons over huge, Majora's Mask I felt was too repetitive and then Windwaker I found to have a very bland over world as it just took forever to sail to places. Skyward Sword I could not even get through because there was a really good game in there, but it was plagued by the WII's shoddy controls. This one though was just great, not perfect, but closer than any of the other 3D perspective games I have played. My other super favorite Zelda game is the one for the Super Nintendo, Link to the Past. This Zelda game is more about exploring and I enjoy doing that a lot. There are dungeons, but they are navigated easily and it doesn't take all that long to get through them and I did not need a guide to navigate them! A real treat and a great entry to the series.

The story has Link awakening from a slumber with no memories. He gets a device called a Shieka Slate that helps him navigate the world and he sets out on his quest to stop Ganon who is at it once again! Link must find shrines to increase his power, he must free the guardians to gain powers and help aid in his quest to defeat Ganon and he must help the lands become free of terror that is Ganon!

The game play is mainly exploring as you get to got where you want after you get through the first plateau and get the glider. Granted, it becomes easier getting places the more stamina you build up as this Link has amazing climbing abilities! It is fun just searching for towns, stables to spend the night and checking the map and seeing if anything looks interesting to explore. You can find this little guys called Koraks that give you seeds that help expand your inventory and you can find shrines to help you can heart containers and more stamina plus there are fairy fountains to help increase the strength of your inventory. Weapons break in this one and at times that was a bit annoying, but not as bad once you get the master sword. I also wish Nintendo had a trophy system because it would have added more motivation to complete quests, as you do not get all that much for completing most quests, usually just rupees which are kind of plentiful in this one.

So, definitely my favorite of the 3D perspective Zelda games and perhaps my fave period. I loved the exploring aspect of the game, though I did not really take advantage of the horse riding in this one. I was afraid I would miss too much riding the horses. It is fun finding new places in this one, as I said I would open the map and try to figure out an interesting place to go during my quest. Where a shrine might be hidden or a Korak may be hiding. I liked freeing the guardians and gaining powers that would help me survive longer or explore more fully too. Just an incredible game, I like this format and hope they do a variation of it for another Zelda, but perhaps add a few more typical dungeons to change it up.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AsaZimbabwe,24-01-2018,"Some minor annoyances aside, here is one of the all-time great video games. Appropriately borrowing from Elder Scrolls and Hayao Miyazaki, Zelda has built on its own foundation, and matured to a near-perfect marriage of action, adventure, role-playing and whimsical fantasy in a fun, interactive format. Many have criticized the minimalist soundtrack, which is noticeably missing the classic, upbeat Zelda theme song, yet in many ways this feels closer to the original Legend of Zelda than so many of its predecessors. Don't miss Windwaker & Ocarina, but rest assured the shortcomings of Skyward Sword are dramatically overcome in BotW. Disappointing end-game content includes redundant armor properties, essentially no reward for finding hundreds of Koroks, a moderate shortage of unique enemy types, some severely empty places in the vast world & over-priced DLC which adds little replay value. Otherwise a wonderful, magical experience worth at least 50 hours of exploration.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

RodPrestes,17-07-2021,"This game is incredible. There's so much to do, so much to see, to explore.

The gameplay is where it shines.
Everything from exploration to combat is extensively flexible.
The world is rich, no matter where you are there is a shrine or enemy camp or a tower or a labyrinth.

But where the game play shines it lacks on lore.
Sure there is story and it's not a bad story at all, but maybe by the open ended nature of how the story is told (and how important pieces are hidden on diaries) it is not as impacting as other Zelda titles.

Maybe that's done on purpose since Breath of the Wild is as unusual game.
This is the first time a Zelda game has a direct sequel (which by the time I write this is not out yet) so maybe it will provide more context just like Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity did for the character of princess Zelda.

But in 2017 where I first played it and the other tie-in games were not announced yet, it felt incomplete (again, maybe on purpose).

The divine beast are kinda disappointing too, but the massive amount of shrines make up for the challenges expected on a Zelda game.

Other than theses setbacks the game is amazing.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TobiasKen,18-06-2018,"This game... it's good. It's been over a year since its release, and only now I've gotten around to reviewing it (to be honest, I forgot my Metacritic log-in details...) Before I start, if you want a TL;DR - absolutely buy this game. It's an unforgettable masterpiece.

A: Music/Sounds

As I stated previously in my The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess review, I believe that one of the overall most infamous parts of a Legend of Zelda game is the incredible music. However, despite the unreachable expectations this game probably had for music, I can't help but feel that the music in the final game is rather... disappointing. There's not really any memorable tracks except for the main theme of the game - which in my opinion is really good, basically on par with other LoZ games.

The sounds of the game are great. The grunts of the monsters, the clanging of your weapons as they dangle from your character as you race around Hyrule - the sounds of the fearsome Guardians as they lock onto you will make anyone's skin crawl. Some sounds can get a little repetitive over time, like the little ""Ya Ha Ha!"" that every single Korok makes as you discover them.

6/10 - Sounds are good but some are repetitive, Music is, for the most part, lacking.

B: Graphics

This game's graphics really are pretty good. Obviously they aren't realistic in any way, but that just works because the game isn't attempting to look realistic - Breath of the Wild attempts to use its own art-style, which is a little between both Skyward Sword's and Twilight Princess' art styles.

Bokoblins and Moblins look goofy, and the Lizalfos all look... scaly. It gets the point across. The graphics however don't go above and beyond like some titles, and if I'm being honest the trees certainly look off and previous gen. I'd prefer if the game had a realistic art style like Twilight Princess did, but I suppose that it's less likely to look outdated in the years to come with this art style.

7/10 - Gets the point across, a few oddities.

C: Gameplay

THIS is where the game truly shines - the gameplay in this game is literally what every other game should aspire to be - not literally, but the quality of the genre. Every review always mentions the freedom of the game, which is true, but not my main focus as many other games have freedom.

A majority of the quests in the game do not give you explicit directions to your destination via waypoints like other games like Skyrim does. This is because many of the quests involve a riddle of some sort, and you have to track down the chest or shrine. I absolutely adore the side quests in the game - every town has plenty, and there's also many unique little side quests scattered across all of Hyrule.

Many people say that Hyrule in this game is rather empty and could benefit from being smaller - but I disagree. It's not empty - the game is so densely packed with content that the average player may be a little overwhelmed with the opportunities given to them. There are shrines and side quests hidden around every corner - the korok seeds especially are enough to make any completionist's blood boil.

Take my advice - play this game without a guide. Seriously. I'm literally not kidding in any way, shape or form when I say that this game has given more such an incredible sense of wonder and enjoyment that even games like Morrowind and Skyrim have never lived up to. Making my way to Goron City and noticing the giant dragon flying in the sky, knowing that someday I'll be able to go up to the dragon himself. Finding massive statues in Gerudo Desert with an enticing puzzle with no quests leading me there - even finding Eventide Island and going through that challenge was awe-inspiring.

Unfortunately, the sense of wonder and discovery makes the game a little less enjoyable if you play through for a second time, such as if you're playing on Master Mode through the DLC.

10/10 WITH my Thumbs Up of Approval

D: Story

This is the most lacking part of the game. Now, the story of the game isn't bad by any means, but for me, the story does not live up to the story mode of other Legend of Zelda games such as Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess. I just find it hard to have that sense of urgency and care for characters like I did in those games, because practically everyone important is dead by the time the game even begins. Even important characters such as Zelda didn't make me feel as much emotion as other LoZ titles.

Obviously, a lot of the story was made to be independent from one another, to allow the player to approach any dungeon they wish first - even allowing them to go straight to the final boss. While that's great, I just feel that in order to achieve that level of freedom, the game sacrificed a potentially incredible story. If the next Legend of Zelda game had the story of the same quality of Twilight Princess and gameplay of Breath of the Wild, it'd be a solid 10/10 from me.

5/10 - poor story.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Halyo,08-10-2020,"The game has enough good things about it to make it at least somewhat enjoyable throughout, but there is simply a lack of meaningful progression to make the journey throughout the open-world truly worthwhile like a supposed masterpiece would have.
It was stated by devellopers that the design philosophy here was to make everything accessible from the start. Well, I think this is an awful philosophy, considering that ""go anywhere you want from the plateau on"" really means ""do basically the same things you've already done over and over again because there is no progression"".
The cooking system is shallow and repetitive, not to mention it can be used to break the game because you can just stack food indefinitely.
Every progression mechanic in the game is basically an RPG-lite mechanic that boils down to ""kill x to upgrade x's stats"", or ""find same weapon with better stats"", with stats only referring to durability and damage output.

The combat is ok, but for most encounters, spamming the attack button will suffice, and you can avoid nearly all ennemies quite easily. That would be ok if the loot you get from ennemies would be worthwhile, or fighting ennemies would grant you access to more unique areas, but unfortunately it's pretty much a self-contained loop, making it better to disengage from combat most of the time.
Environmental interaction, for being praised so much, is NOT significant most of the time, fire and ice suck, electricity is only good in that it's an OP mechanic that can be used anywhere (only that in water it's completely busted). Also the game severely lacks ennemy variety. In the overworld, you'll encounter about 4 ennemies with re-skins (really not counting the blobs and the bats, because those are just pathetic), and 3 bosses.

Now, exploring the world itself feels satisfying enough. The traversal mechanics are good. The shrine quests specifically are good, but they are too few and far between to completely redeem the game's open world. The 4 basic dungeons are also good, as is the DLC dungeon, and trials of the sword is also pretty fleshed out.
Those are all good things that taken together make the game stand a little bit above most open-worlds, but it just doesn't wash away the fact that you are playing a tech-demo that overstays its welcome.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The game's attention to detail, storytelling, exploration design, puzzles, gameplay loop, side quests, graphics, environments and performance/stability in the Nintendo Switch are all very praiseworthy elements.

That being said, the game is full of surprises at every corner and I love the fact you can overcome every situations in many ways.

Stresspresso,27-12-2017,"Honestly the joy I had playing this game, as a new game was just perfect. No long winded tutorials, just a small sectioned off part of the game world, untill you get eveything you need. No set course, just do the 4 things and be set free. Me and my friends, all played the start differently, we learned different strategies, and secrets. Havn't been this excited about a game for a long time. All the while playing this game on a train, on a projected 120inch display, on the toilet. Perfect. I never did finnish it, but explored every nook and cranny of the world that I got my fill.

The map design is awesome as well, this game always wants to show you something interesting in the distance and it can always makes you feel like you are having the most amazing adventure, no other title in the market can offer the REAL sense of adventure that this game has.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Cougargames,01-11-2019,"A great Zelda game, definetly a must buy. A great world to explore that makes exploration more fun then before, good variation in enemies and new tools that make the game more fun. The game is unlike any oter Zelda game made before. Bad parts weapons degrade quikly wich can turn people off from using certain wepons wich kinda destroys the purpose of having a good weapon. Dungeons are not the same as before they are more spread around and short so overall not as great as before. A decent story but not great, and the soundtrack is definetly a step down compared to previous titles atleast. This game could have been a nine without a doubt but not giving the game a great story, traditionall dungeons, great soundtrack and removing the breakable weapons gives the game a ower score. This said its still a must buy and one of my favorite games on the switch!",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Kumatetsu,19-05-2020,"Pros:
1_ Hands down has the best open world map design and layout in 8th gen. It forces the player to explore the game world and find something interesting wherever they go. Also it's not bloated with side/filler quests and the few side quest it has usually have a satisfying outcome in the end.
2_ Traversal in BOTW is actually challenging and fun. A lot of open world games try to make it as easy as pressing or holding down just one button but in BOTW it requires planning ahead and managing the stamina thus it feels more engaging and less boring. (*Also in a lot of games a tall wall or a mountain means ""stop, turn back! There is nothing to see here"" but in BOTW walls and mountains are mostly obstacles, challenging you to overcome them for better armor, weapon, upgrade materials and etc).
3_ It's extremely fun to kill bosses and some mini bosses (excluding the final boss). Usually there is some creative ways to fight, counter and finish them.
4_ Great combat design. Abilities and weapons on their own are kinda boring and we've seen something like it in other games but like everything else in this game, the combat is a puzzle. You have to figure out the right way to chain them and make your own fun combo. Even tho it's simple, it rarely gets repetitive.
5_ Sound design is amazing. You can close your eyes and tell what kind of environment you're in, at what time of the day. It makes the game world feel real and alive.

Cons:
1_ Lack of enemy variety, same enemies every where but you have to kill them because you need the materials they drop.
2_ Lack of a more imaginative story.
3_ Battle music, doesn't hype the player enough.
4_ Uninspired final boss design (I enjoyed going through the castle more than fighting Calamity Ganon) and unsatisfying ending .

Overall Breath of the Wild is what I wanted from open world games for a very long time. A truly open world game worth exploring and a game that makes you feel you're the adventurer and not a player, experiencing someone else's story.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Whether it is through its story of going on a quest to overcome an evil threatening the world or through the elementary characters you get to meet through the course of your quest or through the puzzles and platform experience represented in the dungeons and bosses, the Legend of Zelda games always create an experience fondly remembered when it comes to gaming. Breath of the Wild is no different. Actually, that is an understatement, Breath of the Wild is expertly crafted and merges those “zelda” elements within an open world setting in such a phenomenal and ridiculously fun way. It is astonishing really, unbelievable in fact how brilliantly constructed Breath of the Wild is.

AngerIssuez,14-09-2019,"Most open-world games suck; but this is not one of them. Being out in the world is a blast, and is what carries this game to success. The problem is that the dungeons (which are designed as keystone moments in this and every older LoZ game) are just terrible, and the shrine system feels totally divorced from the beautifully-realized world that the rest of the game takes place in. Also the weapon durability system feels like quite a nuisance, even if the design compensates for it.

Firepistol95,13-11-2017,"The freedom of how you explore the world is what mainly sets it apart. The climbing and gliding are very well done and you can literally go anywhere. The verticallity of this game really adds a lot to the open world genre imo. This could be a personal opinion, but a big thing that I've loved about it, is it really gives you a sense of self-made adventure that I haven't felt in a game in a long time. Usually in open world games you ""clear"" the map out by going to the different icons to collect things or do quests. Zelda is the opposite where your map is blank, and you have to fill it in yourself. It greatly encourages you to explore places, and use your own eyes, looking out at the crafted world they've created, rather than looking at your mini map where the next icon is. You make your own icons on your map. I think this is big part of what sets it apart. It also will continually surprise you, and has that Nintendo quality and charm.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

artificeprime,04-11-2017,"Breath of the Wild dares to reinvent the already excellent Zelda formula and actually succeeds at improving it in most ways.

The sheer scope of Breath of the Wild makes all past games in the series seem like child's play. From the outset of the game it is made clear that this is a Zelda world that is on a completely different scale and the amount of freedom in this new version of Hyrule is equally impressive. In a lot of way this game feels like a fresh start for the series. It feels almost like this is the game that the creators wanted 30 years ago but just couldn't create because of technical limitations. This is the first version of Hyrule that actually feels like a living breathing world, that is just waiting for you to explore. Open world games have become pretty standard in the current generation but most of those games fail to really live up to the idea of truly being open. Breath of the Wild doesn't have that problem, it is probably the most truly open world game that I can recall. Not only can you go almost anywhere and climb almost anything, you can also discover the story out of order. It is the type of experience that I have been waiting for since I started playing video games decades ago. I don't think Breath of the Wild is a perfect game, it has flaws but what it does well it does so well that it still easily ranks among the best games I have ever played.

The gameplay is a nearly perfect blend of exploration, puzzle solving, collecting, platforming and combat. The paraglider makes moving through the world more easy and fun than ever before. The addition of jumping and climbing controls also really help to open up the world and offer a whole knew dimension to exploration and puzzle solving. There aren't as many key items in this game but the ones they do have can be used in countless creative ways. Being able to control metal objects with the megnesis ability creates countless gameplay possibilities. The fact that nearly everything in the world can be interacted with creates so many possibilities that even after over 100 hours I was still discovering new things that I could do. My only major complaint about the gameplay is that swimming is a major chore and you cannot swim underwater which was a major letdown, especially since swimming was done better in almost every other 3d Zelda game. Still that flaw is majorly overshadowed by the vast number of new gameplay abilities. Not only can nearly every part of the environment be climbed you can even climb some enemies and ride any animal that is big enough to be ridden. Another amazing aspect of the gameplay is the physics and weather systems. Link reacts to different types of weather and that impacts what kind of clothing you need to wear. The amount of things you can do in this game is incredible. Gameplay wise this is easily the best Zelda game.

The story in Breath of the Wild starts out great, the game has some of the most interesting ideas in the series and explores some of the characters in new and interesting ways. Unfortunately the story gets a bit watered down as it progresses and the conclusion is far less satisfying than past entries in the series. It isn't the worst Zelda story line but it isn't the best and I think it fell short of its potentially great concept. I did find that it was good enough to keep me immersed though and I while it didn't surprise me as much as I hoped there were some good moments. Overall I would say the story was good enough but certainly not great.

The world is the true star of Beath of the Wild, it leaves all past Zelda worlds in the dust and is perhaps the best game world I have ever seen. Each region is massive and full of memorable locations. What really sets it apart from other open world games though is the level of freedom and interactivity. Climbing mountains to discover caves, seeing giant dragons in the distance, paragliding over ancient ruins, hunting goats on foggy hilltops. It feels alive and full of wonder. There is so much to be seen and discovered. It also has some of the most interesting towns and far more of them than past games in the series. While the towns aren't that big each one is iconic and has unique characteristics that make a lot of sense. Zora's Domain and Gerudo Town stood out as being very unique. There were some disappointing areas such as the Goron town but even it wasn't terrible, it just could have been a lot better and isn't the best version. While there aren't traditional dungeons there are 120 shrines, 5 divine beasts, 3 labyrinths and the best version of Hyrule castle by far. I can't say I didn't miss the traditional Zelda dungeons but I also don't know if I would trade all the new dungeons that this game had. The world of Breath of the Wild is without question the best in the series.

Overall I think Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda game and one of the best games of all time. it is a giant step in the right direction.

I give it a 93%",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
arcDaniel,24-10-2017,"Best Zelda game ever played. The Freedom and the Physik Effects are amazing.
There is a lot of new Stuff but if you like other Zelda Games, you will feel right at home.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Ishi123,29-07-2019,"As close to perfect as any Zelda game has come. Breath of the Wild is what open world games should be; a vast expanse in which your skill ceiling is the only limit, able to go anywhere and everywhere right from the outset, and packed to the brim with things to do and see and explore without feeling stale and empty like the likes of Skyrim. No moment in this game is boring, and the freedom the game affords you is limitless.

I only have a few gripes about the game and they're minor. I wish that we had more actual dungeons in the same vein as the old Zeldas. As it is, we get 120 mini-dungeons that are just a sequence of puzzles and 5 main dungeons, the last of which is probably one of the coolest of any Zelda dungeon, though the other 4 don't feel as grand and expansive as the older dungeons. The lack of things to do after you've completed the main game and have done all the shrines and all the sidequests makes the world feel much smaller than it actually is once you know where everything is, and a New Game Plus mode wouldn't go amiss, or at least the ability to make a new game without having to make an entirely separate Switch profile. Whatever happened to the three save slots you get in the older games?

In any case, I had an absolute blast with Breath of the Wild, being my first Zelda game since the ye olde days of Twilight Princess on the Gamecube, and now that I actually truly own my own Nintendo console, I'm hyped up for the sequel, which I'm willing to bet will earn the last point that its predecessor barely misses.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Angel_Sigh,04-09-2019,"WARNING: THIS IS A PROPER, ADULTS' REVIEW

That out of the way I'd like to make it clear that I haven't come here to balance out the mentalists giving the game 0/10. They're welcome to their own obsessions, and I remember being a partisan about one side back when the console wars were Sega VS Nintendo and Sonic VS Mario. I'm in my thirties now, and I've played games ever since my first Gameboy back in 1990 or so. I've owned the following consoles: GB, SNES, N64, GC, Wii and Wii-U; PSs 1, 2, 3 and 4; Xboxes 1, 360 and ONE, Gamegear; PC. I've missed very few if any of the truly great games on those machines and I've been consciously and unconsciously building up a 'Top 10 Greatest Games Of All-Time' list in my mind ever since I played the first game that really woke me up to the potential of video games as a medium. That game was Final Fantasy VI on my old import SNES(called Final Fantasy III for the American market.) and a few years after that game blew my mind I bought a copy of Final Fantasy VII for my PC and was even more blown away. Those two formed my top 2 until, a year later, I played Half-Life on my beat-up old PC, in the lowest possible resolution, and was utterly riveted for the duration.
Ever since then, ever since that four year run between 1995 and 1999 my top three has remained a level apart from all the other games I've played. Great games like Majora's Mask, San Andreas, Resident Evil 4, Bloodborne...I've loved them all, but something intangible has separated those top three games of mine from the rest. FFVI, FFVII and Half-Life have just rested there, at the very peak, and nothing has really made it halfway up the mountain since.
I have been playing Breath Of The Wild for the last month and it is the first time in eighteen years where I feel like I'm playing something that not only belongs in the company of those three games, but by all objective standards, trumps them.
It is notoriously difficult, dear reader, to separate your ability to evaluate art from the age you were when you first experienced that art. The music I listened to when I was in my mid-teens hit me like nothing since then ever has. The films I saw when I was that age affected me more than anything that I've watched since. Of course I'm not so unreasonable that I believe that all of history's greatest art was released between 1995 and 1999...I recognise that the intensity of my emotions at that age meant I felt the impact of the art more keenly than I have since then, and that to a certain extent my list of all-time great films, albums, games, etc. is determined by the period into which I was born. If I was a teenager in 1968 I'd have said that The Beatles White Album and The third Velvet Underground album were the greatest albums of all-time, and if I'd been a teenager in the mid-noughties I'd be writing about how obvious it is that Resident Evil 4 is the greatest game ever made.
So I realise that the games in my all-time top 3 are protected from being knocked off their perch partly by nostalgia. Don't get me wrong: I will argue for their objective brilliance, and I still think they have qualities that subsequent games in their genres have never come close to recapturing, but I feel that they are protected by the warm, intense rush of teenage nostalgia.
My point is that any new game released after my 'golden era' will inevitably suffer by comparison simply because my emotions have become less intense over the years. and as a result it's truly difficult to judge whether a game(or an album, film, whatever), if I'd played it back when I was a teenager, would have made it into my top three. I think I'd have been blown away by Bloodborne if I'd played it when I was sixteen, but I'm not sure. It's a great game, but would it have been an all-time favourite? As it is it's hovering around the no. 5/6 mark in my GOAT list, but it hasn't pierced the top 3.
All this self-indulgent reminiscing on my part is for a purpose - I'm trying to put across just how difficult it is for a modern game to shake me. Modern games are handicapped because they lack the sheen of nostalgia, they are handicapped by the sense that I've played something like it many times before, by the massively expanded choice of things to do these days compared with when I was younger. In other words, they have no chance of really hitting me like games used to.
And yet...through that fog of cynicism Breath Of The Wild has pierced. It is beautiful. It is jaw-droppingly huge. It is a gamer's game, that allows you to control Link in a way that is unthinkable to CD Projekt Red or Bethesda or Ubisoft - quick and responsive and nimble in a way that no other open world avatar has ever been. And above all, it is mysterious and deep, like a forest that wants to pull you in, or a dark cave on a coastline.
I have not stopped playing it since I got it. In short my top three has finally been reordered. BOTW may just be the best game I've ever played",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This game is amazing so far it brings the best nintendo switch graphics to the table with a stunning but sometimes repetitive world.
The combat is good that in my opinion doesn't get old
But then there's the amazing story and dialogs what makes this game so great
I also think the camera could have been better if you fight multiple enemies but overall its great
There's also a lot of content that keep you up for weeks
And that you can take this game to an airplane is just the tomato sauce on the spaghetti

Pirante,16-09-2018,"These are the positives and negatives, as much as I am able to sum up.

Positives:

- Gorgeous visuals.

- Gorgeous, vast open world.

- A wonderful music score.

- Good link-up with the lore of the franchise.

- Exploration is, by and large, fun.

- Secrets are still plentiful and a joy to find, it really helps push the drive to explore.

- A challenging level of difficulty which makes this a game in which you need to focus on, hack and slash will not serve you well (as it does in many previous Zelda titles).

- SOME really fun puzzles (others not so much).

- A lot to do, sinking 100+ hours into this game is easy to do.

- I like the story, it fits the game and makes sense to me.

- Variety of locations and environments is excellent, you really do have a sense of exploring a real world.

Negatives:

- Lack of intuitive controls. Combat in particularly feels clunky and inaccurate.

- Baptism of fire. The game tells you how to do very little at the beginning. This resulted in me wandering about for hours getting one-hit killed by enemies and not understanding why. [Pro-tip: Upgrade your armour as soon as possible, enemy avoidance will be a key strategy early on]

- The weather. The idea of changeable weather is good. The idea that wet weather makes climbing more difficult is plausible. The idea that rain can stop you climbing an average sized tree - you who have literally scaled mountains - is absurd. It can also cause you to waste time waiting for weather to pass, this is annoying.

- Breakable weapons. Not being able to keep pretty much all of your weapons makes you hoard good weapons, I think this detracts from the game play. Having to collect Korok seeds to increase inventory space is also very tedious.

- Puzzles. There are some unbelievably tedious puzzles in this game and, with the sheer number of shrines, these really grate. The puzzles using the gyroscope are a nightmare to use as the controls are so absurdly awful. How this passed the play-testing phase without being removed is a mystery to me.

- Tedium. I think there are too many moments in this game whereby the action you are required to do is more tedious than fun. Cooking, whilst a good idea in principle, loses its charm after the 100th cut scene and subsequent musical ditty. Some of the items required to upgrade armour are a chore to find and frustrate rather than entertain. The game suffers from too many of these moments.

- Cut-scenes (or lack of them). They do exist in the game, but much of the dialogue takes place via scrolling text. They were doing this with the very first Zelda games. They should really have better developed and more extensive cut-scenes in 2018, scrolling text as the predominate means of conveying the story is pretty poor in my view.

- Complete lack of tuition. The idea of a free world to explore is great, but some hints/teaching mechanisms to help players adapt and understand the game would be a big help. This is the first Zelda title where I have had to use guides in order to figure out how to progress.

Conclusion:

I really like the game but I cannot fathom the perfect and near perfect scores. This is a game that does lots of things well but that has some pretty big issues as well. The beauty of the game should not be able to conceal the fact that there are flaws that can be improved upon. Is this a good game? Absolutely. Does this game have flaws? Certainly. It is/was it the game of 2017? I don't think so. Is it the best Zelda game? Unequivocally no for me. The biggest plus for this game? The world itself, it is truly exceptional and a huge amount of fun exploring. The biggest negative? The tedium/wasted time in some of the game play - these are a real negative. Feeling like you're having your time wasted due to a games mechanics seriously impacts on your ability to enjoy the game and I found myself putting it down, on more than one occasion, when presented with such tedium.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
driscoll42,03-09-2017,"Open World Zelda, a concept that actually is a natural extension of the series but for the first time done and it's amazing. Gone are the linear dungeons unlocking items to progress further in the game. You want to fight Ganon in the first half hour? Go for it. You want to spend 200 hours exploring every side quest, nook and crany? Go for it.

The core concept is the same tried and true story, Ganon has conquered Hyrule, and it's up to Link to rescue the Princess and Kingdom. However this time, Link lost 100 years before, and now he needs to save the kingdom he didn't before. Honestly the story itself is only... good, not amazing. It's nothing truly new. But no one ever really played Zelda for the story alone.

What makes the game amazing is everything else. A brilliant starting area, the ""Great Plateau"" which naturally teaches you the core mechanics you'll use in the rest of the game. Instead of just one weapon, one or two sets of armor you use throughout the whole game, you hvae a plethora of armors which grant you better climbing, stealth, defense, attack, swimming, cold or heat resistance. Weapons which have different strength, two handed, one handed, set things on fire, freeze them, shock them, etc... You'll never use just one weapon or armor forever. Of course a huge part of this is the durability system which makes your weapons break after a while. A clever is often annoying system, but a good way to handle it.

Probably the best part of the game is exploring, and discovering shrines. The world has everything from artic wastes to deserts and forests, mountains (you will be climbing, all the time), people everywhere with stories and side quests. But most of all you'll be hunting for shrines, mini dungeons, more puzzles than dungeons, to test your skills and unlock extra hearts or stamina. There's 120... and each one is worth searching for.

All in all, this is probably the best Zelda game ever, and is a system seller. I played this every day for a couple months on my work train commute, which made it so much more enjoyable. Even though I put over 60 hours in the game I'm looking forward to a chance to play some more of the story DLC (though just doing all the various side quests doesn't entice me as much)",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

superzombie11,08-03-2017,"As a Zelda fan, I was a bit worried going into an open-world Zelda game. The risk paid off, though, because I have to say I am very impressed. There is always something to explore, an adventure to be had, a shrine to complete, or a quest to be taken. The art style is also absolutely beautiful. The combat may seem simple at first but I quickly learned there are many ways to approach a single enemy, and, with the right strategy, you can fight enemies way out of your league. The only problems I had in Breath of the Wild were occasional frame rate drops and sometimes coming across an enemy I have no chance of fighting yet (guardians). Also, I noticed many other reviews on this site say there are no main dungeons, but dungeons do exist in the game. In fact, you have to complete them just to finish the main quest. Just goes to show how many haters gave this game a bad score without even playing it. Grow up, guys.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The only reason I don't give it a 10 is because of the story. I think this game was more focused on gameplay and the story doesn't even come close to the epicness of the most renowned Zelda games (like Ocarina, Majora's or Link to the Past).

josemanuel0640,16-09-2017,"De los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida. La libertad y el contenido que brinda es bestial. Tengo mucho mas de 200h jugadas y aun me falta contenido para rato. En cuanto a físicas y jugabilidad es una portento y con respecto a la resolución una obra de arte. Las posibilidades que te brinda son inmensas al igual que sus misiones secundarias que son entretenidas y extensas lo cual te ayuda mucho a interactuar con el mundo. Su banda sonora es buena pero se queda corta en comparación con lo que ya nos tienen acostumbrado en esta saga, pues se centran sobre todo en sonidos ambientales y tonadas instrumentales que no son malas pero pierden en comparación con las canciones y bandas sonoras épicas de anteriores Zelda. La historia principal es el aspecto en el que mas cae este juego y no me refiero a su argumento sino como este fue llevado a cabo, pues tenia muchísimo potencial y ojo que no quedo mal del todo pero me quede con el deseo de ver algo mas. Personalmente el cambio le ha sentado muy bien, lo considero la mejor experiencia de aventura que haya tenido en un zelda y posiblemente en cualquier otro juego. No es el mejor titulo de la sega que he jugado pero si uno de los mejores juegos de estos ultimos tiempos e incluso posible candidato a mejor juego del año pero eso ya lo dira el resto de los jugadores.

Puedo entender que haya personas que lo alaben increíblemente y otros que lo critiquen a muerte pero de algo podemos estar todos seguros independientemente de si nos guste o no este juego y es que es una obra maestra que pasara a ser recordado con el paso del tiempo como lo han hecho muchos de sus predecesores tales como A link to the past, Ocarina of time, Wind water, etc..",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
theSMOOF,10-03-2017,"The Legend of Zelda has never been more alive than in Breath of the Wild. The game pays homage to every single thing that made the series what is is, and in the same stroke seeks to rewrite those elements in a way that feels modern, deliberate, and spectacular.

This Zelda is completely open. It's the first time since 1986 that Nintendo has been comfortable giving YOU the reigns and allowing you to create the Legend for yourself. Gone is the hour+ hand holding tutorial introduction to the game and story. This game is much more abstract. You are given a shirt and some pants, a shiny futuristic tablet, and told to go out and make your place in the world.

The story is given to you in pieces, fragments. Some people may complete the game without ever really learning the whole story that led to Link's current dilemma. If you wanted to, you could go ""storm the castle"" and defeat the end boss within the first hour or so of the game. You'd have to be extremely skilled and extremely lucky, but it's technically possible.

In a series that has been built upon a series of closed doors, and slowly feeding you the tools to get passed them, this game instead gives you those tools from the onset and allows you to get the doors open as you wish. You can truly go anywhere and do anything, and there are as many different ways to solve the various obstacles as there are obstacles.

I could talk about the game all day, and what it has done to grow and evolve, but the simple end result is that this is easily the best iteration of a Zelda game we've ever gotten. It may be the best Open World game that's been made, and I may even go as far as to say it's now my favorite game of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
JayJuliet,10-03-2017,"It is one of the greatest Zelda game i have ever played. The details and designs, how open it is, the amount of stuff you can do heck even the npc and important characters are unique in their own way. Even the small easter eggs that this game bring us about the older Zelda games that has been made. I have never been so in love with a game in my life and it does deserve all those perfect scores from all gaming media.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Douwert,30-10-2017,"Nintendo is very ambitious with this game, on a lot of fronts they succeeded but they left me dissapointed about some. This is supposed to be the game where they pull all kinds of things from every Zelda game to make it the best one yet, but in that regard I was disappointed about the stuff they did keep in the game.
They removed dungeons, big towns, interesting characters, meaningful side-quests like in Majora's Mask and of course the items and statisfying progression the older games offer.

However this is one of the best free and liberating games I've ever played with it's massive world and loads of nooks and cranny's too explore, the shrines offer fun challenges but could have done with some more separate theming. Korok seeds are rewarding the first 80 or so times you find them but after that it becomes a grind and annoying ( Yes it's optional but after that they give so little reward it's not worth it to find them) Weapons shouldn't break entirely maybe make them blunt and after that happens they break, but they should have a blacksmith that can repair them.

I love the different kinds of armor pieces availible and that you can paint them in any colour you want (except the hero's tunic unfortunately). The bosses didn't really feel that challenging and also wished they had more variety.

I enjoyed my play trough of the game a lot and will come back now and then to play some more, the DLC also has me interested and I hope they can adress some problems I have with the game as it is now.

I recommend the game and you should buy it and play it until you get bored.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
AppleJames,11-03-2017,"At first I got real doubtful of this game, I thought it would be pretty empty with not a lot of things to do, However, when I picked this game up and started playing I realized the game had a bunch of little distractions like Korok Puzzles and Shrines sprinkled through the game that keep you entertained to keep playing seeking out the next thing for you to do, although this kinda gets flawed as you progress in the game, as there is less things to do and it starts feeling like a chore to seek out these tiny distractions.

The game feels really immersive, NPCs and Enemies will react to their surroundings making the world feel real with their own daily routines, although I do wish that some quests and events would occur with the Day-Night Cycle, much like in Majora's Mask.

Combat is also pretty great, but It is lacking some things established in older games, while introducing some new things. For starters there are weapon classes now, You got Spears, 2 Handed Swords, 1 Handed Swords, and Boomerangs. and not only do you have the Different Weapon Classes, but you have Weapons that have their own properties too, you'll come across weapons that are easier to use for Smashing Rocks, or Cutting Wood, or Swords that will send out a slash through the air.

As for materials it's really fun to see what you can do with them in Cooking Recipes or as objects in the game world. Some items can be used as Fish Bait, while others can be used in a way that makes the game feel like a big sand box.

I am kinda mixed on the story however. It feels like a Jumbled mess, and I think that may be what Nintendo was going for, but nothing is in exact order. The story takes place through various memories from 100 years ago but you need to go out to certain locations so link can remember what happened long ago. The Memories are in some of the most remote locations, but it does seam like a neat idea, as the game will give you Images of these locations and it encourages you to explore to find them. Thing is I didn't happen to stumble upon the locations, I actually went out and searched for them, if I were to just happen to randomly find these Places I would have felt so much better about this because it wouldn't have felt like such a chore, it would be this nice little neat moment where I discovered part of the story when i didn't even realize it. Either way the story is fine once you put all the pieces together, it's not exactly perfect, but it still works.

Side quests are something that really bugged me in the game, most side quests are just Fetch Quests, where you go out and find an Item(s) and hand them over, however there are a few gems that do things much more different and those are the ones I absolutely love. Although it is pretty understandable that most of the Side Quests be Fetch Quests, I mean it's not like Nintendo was going to add a whole bunch of Unique Quests to such a big world. They would have to keep coming up with a bunch of brand new Ideas for Side Quests, ultimately pushing back the game longer.

Overall, Breath of the Wild is an outstanding title for the series that breaks new boundaries, and I believe it should be held as one of the best Zelda Games in the series.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SaydaNeen,12-01-2018,"Excellent game minus a few kinks, good story, good exploration, keeps you engaged and coming back and playing for long hours. One of the few things i found frustrating is the weapon breaking system, you don't get personal with any weapons, every single weapon (minus master sword) lasts maybe 2 battles of 4 to 6 guys which makes it kind of tedious finding weapons constantly. I also saw someone mention the music being underwhelming which i can fully agree, most Zelda games have great trademark music which really brought you into the ""Zelda"" lore, but it is mostly absent here. All in all its an extraordinary game taking you to many places and does an excellent job keeping you interested, even with the con's i can't give it any less than a 9. If the music was Zelda worthy it'd be a 10/10.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
S5658,22-03-2017,"I don't believe this game deserves so many 10/10 reviews, but it definitely doesn't deserve a 0/10 like some jealous people are rating it, most presumably without even playing the game. The exploration is great, it's an open world that you truly want to explore, and even more, is truly open. Once you're finished with the first 4 shrines you can go anywhere, finish up the next 116 shrine, or even go directly to Ganon without doing any of the story. The music is decent, Hyrule Castle is an amazing final dungeon theme. However, the frame rate does drop in extremely busy areas, but not enough to absolutely ruin gameplay.

ImNotAFanboy,15-03-2017,"This is to me a very good game. The game play is reminiscent of the original Legend of Zelda, and the new mechanics integrated into the game. The controls were very smooth when I was playing it, and returning features such as the stamina bar are improved. The visuals are one of the best parts of the game, and this game is more open-world than almost any other Nintendo game. There are some problems though, such as frame rate drops on the switch in docked mode, and the occasional small spike of lag. These problems were fixed in portable mode, but the battery life is much lower when playing BOTW in portable mode. To top it all off, the story is very intriguing, and makes you want to rediscover Link's past. If this is a sign of switch games to come, I am very hopeful for the future of the system.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Kamikazeshocki,02-09-2017,"As a long time Zelda player since SNES/Game Boy times I was so incredible sceptical about this one. And everything I feared came true but I was also amazed:

Negative:
- The dungeons and bosses are way way too few, too short and too easy. The dungeons were always a landmark of game design. I completed the Dungeon at Death Mountain + Boss in 30 Minutes. The longest dungeon Gerudo Fortress + boss took me 1.5h. What the hell...
- All relevant Link powers are basically available in the first hours of game time. There will be abilities to gain and some armor with special perks. No grappling hook in midgame or some mirror shield with which you can conquer new challenges.
- The weapon durability feels forced. I can live with that because I got enough weapon slots but at first it was annoying. And I am glad my armor is not affected.
- All negative points of open world RPG like Witcher and Skyrim do apply here. Meaningless sidequests and too many content that is just not important at all.
- The shrines are good though and it is addicting to search for them, BUT I wished they would've put the effort to create at least half of the shrines into creating more and longer dungeons.
- There could've been more enemy variants.
- Compared to other RPG Zelda's story was always weak or let's say it didn't matter much but now it feels even more unimportant. Just the few hours you are occupied with the divine beasts and the memory hunt you get some story.

OK but now to the amazing side:
- Nintendo amazingly succeeded in building probably one of the, or the best open world I've ever seen. The game design of the world, the form, it is all so magnificient and you litereally can't stop exploring the next stupid hill, valley, cave, coast...
- The world is so massive, I would not believe it at first. And it does feel real/alive, despite some peoples claim. Animals, Natures forces, enemy behaviour is all full of little good ideas and feels proper.
- The interaction with that world is a nice and new touch, felling trees, using magnetic objects, doing literally what comes into your mind to solve the problem or advance further. You are completely unrestricted. This is very very good.
- Link's ability to climb everywhere is the most enjoyable ability ever created in an open world game. I always moved through the world by climbing up hills then gliding down....I almost never walked the floor.
- The game looks aesthetically beautiful and I am impressed what they did with the weak Switch hardware.

Summary:
- Does this Zelda break with the Zelda Tradition? Yes, heavily
- Is the NEW Zelda style as awesome in it's own way as the past Zeldas ? Yes, definetly.
- Is it worth buying a Switch for? Yes
- Is it one of the best games these years ? yes
- Is it the best game or the best Zelda game ever ? NO
- So I give it a 9/10 because I am not blinded like all the critics and fanboys.
- I am glad I saw some true good ol' Nintendo strength at play here.

I adventured for 60h. I conquered all towers, went through each region and did what I liked, bested 61 Shrines, collected 90 Kokoro seeds, got the Master Sword and beat Ganon. Then I got bored because I feel no urge to search for all that endless seeds or the remaining shrines. But that is ok. If you want to collect everything here you gotta spend 100-200 hours here I guess.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Natikfire,19-03-2017,"What can be said about this game, that has not already been said? It does not matter what preferences you have on games, this is a must own. Nintendo, has not tried to craft an open world game in 30 years, and when they do, the rest of the industry got schooled on how to do it properly. The only way to describe this game, is pure excellence. No, it's more than that....this game ruined a lot of other games for me, because it does what video games are meant to do, it was fun. Beyond fun, I got lost, engrossed in this world that Nintendo crafted. If the durability system was better, this game would ha r perfect.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Most of my complaints are technical, frame rate, audio errors stuff like that, though it is irritating it doesn't take away from the experience. The voice acting is okay sometimes great other times okay. This game made me laugh out loud with some clever writing and funny cut scenes. The most irritating thing about the game is the weapon breaking system, though I am not a game developer, I understand why it was implemented though weapons feel flimsy and fragile.

MetalRobot69,31-01-2022,"It is a good game, I can see the amount of effort that the developers put into this game.

The only thing I didn't like was the story. I've felt a lack of a good story, it is just too generic about saving a kingdom, also I despise mute protagonists. Maybe I didn't like the story because I didn't play the older Zelda games, but I still think that the story is generic anyways and I appreciate a good depth story in the games I play.

The gameplay is the best part of the game, the combat is awesome. The base is a ""Souls Style of Combat"" but it has some peculiarities that make it even more interesting. The weapons you use always will break there is nothing you can do to stop them to break so you need to change the weapons and each weapon has a different type of attack and some have special moves like light beams, that really incentive the player to try out different weapons and I really liked. It is cool you don't need to upgrade your weapon to use it, so you can pick up any weapon from the ground and you are ready to use it immediately.

Another peculiarity is how intuitive is the combat, pretty much everything you think works out like you can make things fall over the enemies to kill them, you can throw them on the water, you can use stealth. It is really fun.

The puzzles and the exploration are good, nothing at Mario Odyssey puzzles level but it is still better than the average puzzles you see in the games industry.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

danmoh99,23-03-2017,"So this is my third Zelda game, and it is by far my favorite. I've played Link Between Worlds and Ocarina of Time, but this is different entirely. Firstly, the story is kept very hidden for a while. It takes a lot of time before you find out what's going on. The voice acting is ok sometimes, and really bad other times. There's this one scene with a Goron, you'll know it when you see it... The combat is really good and there is a huge variety of weapons, but the camera is a little too free. I mean it has little to no movement by itself, so while fighting you'll have to move the camera to see the guy you're beating up. And the weapons are a bit too brittle. Maybe just increase the durability by 20% and that would fix it. The shrines are plentiful and they are all unique and some are really puzzling. The Dungeons aren't too hard, but they're really clever and huge. The music isn't classic Zelda, but there are some nice melodies. It does get rather repetitive, though. The world is beautiful. It almost feels alive. Animals and monsters behave very life-like. The goblins go hunting and will steal your weapons if you drop them, but they always drop some goodies so you never run out of weapons. The progression scale is very natural, too. Completing shrines gives you the option to increase your hearts or stamina, so you slowly get better as the game progresses. The frame rate issue exists, but it's hardly noticeable and hardly game-breaking at all. It feels daunting at fist to see the huge Plateau around you, but once you start exploring the world you get used to it. And there are little secrets everywhere. Every peak has a little something for you, as does every cave, canyon, rock, or pond. The world so huge, yet it seems meticulously designed to be chalk full of things to do. You can tame a horse, go hunting, cook, shield surf, fight baddies, or complete the story. It's your world. This game is a system seller, for sure. Please do not emulate it, as the developers have been working on it for years and years.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
JaxMax69,15-11-2017,This game is one of the single greatest games I have ever played. It is everything great about a Zelda game rolled into a giant expansive world and lots of cool areas.

80manjr,21-08-2017,"This game changed my view on video games. When I first got this game, it was my first Zelda game ever. The trailer is just a part on how great this game is. When you first get dropped into this world you are on a introduction like part where you get to learn how to play the game. It limits you, but also still gives you a small example of all the exploration is this game. After the small introduction you are able to go wherever you want. I got so connect to the characters in this game that when I re-watched the trailers and parts of the games I started crying. This game gives emotion, and a great story, but allows you to take breaks and just explore the beautiful world. The biggest complaint was I couldn't continue playing after defeating Ganon unless I went to my last save which didn't count that I defeated Ganon. Overall Rating 99/100.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Mirt,26-03-2017,"What can I say about The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild...
I personally can't give it a 10 but it's really, really close. I took a gamble and decided to treat myself a little bit on a Nintendo Switch and Zelda...

And so I played it.... And ended up losing 20 hours in one sitting which seemed like 2 hours. So the first thing that I noticed that brought this score down from a 10, is the frame drops when on TV mode when you're in long grass. This doesn't happen when in Tablet mode though, and I actually found it more enjoyable in tablet mode.

I also read a lot of reviews talking about the starting area. I can certainly say that the starting area is huge. After I finished my first sitting of the game, I talked to my friends who also bought it. There was so many things that we both missed.

I'm going to have to say that this is definitely the game of the year so far, but it has its problems. A must buy! And if you're worried about the story and lack of things to do. The story is expansive but it's not linear. After spending a couple weeks playing this game, I haven't even explored half of the map. There definitely isn't a lack of things to do.

sleepymae,26-03-2017,"This game is one of the best video games I have played in a while, one of the few large open world games that I am actually interested in exploring every corner of, there is always an excitement of finding out whats over the next mountain or hill. The abilities, battle system, visuals, story and the world youre given complete freedom to explore are all top notch. I believe that Nintendo have pretty much set the bar for what an Open World Experience should be like.

Although there are a vast amount of shrines which are mini dungeons I feel that the Divine Beast dungeons should have had more to them, comparing these main dungeons to previous Zelda Games I feel that they are quite empty and didnt really meet my expectation for a main dungeon. For being the games main dungeons I didnt feel much satisfaction in beating them in comparison to other Zelda games, my only other gripe with the game really is having ""special"" items locked behind amiibo's that you cannot obtain otherwise, Amiibo's making items easier to obtain is one thing but there should still be other (although harder) methods of getting the same items in game. That is the only reason I have given this game a 9/10 (would be 9.5), even so this game is simply a masterpiece.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

camstar13,29-03-2017,"To start off, this game is a must buy if you own a nintendo switch. It has a beautiful soundtrack, a pleasant art style (note I was complimenting the art style, not the graphics quality), and fantastic gameplay mechanics. This is the first zelda game I had played since Oracle of Ages on my gameboy, and overall, I was happy with the quality of the game. However, I felt as if the story was lacking. It's as if the world was almost too open, with a lot of empty space. There are some tedious mechanics in the game, such as weapons breaking after 5-6 hits. Also, with no way to track the durability of these weapons, except a large message saying that it's about to break, which isn't as useful as it sounds when you're right in the middle of heated combat, it can become annoying. However, once you get used to ""switch""ing (see what I did there)to different weapons, it does become easier. Also, the graphics can sometimes become compressed when looking at a large open scene, which can affect your immersion. The climbing mechanic is surprisingly simple, which is good, and there are some fun abilities like shield surfing, which can make the game a whole lot more fun once you use them. Originally, I was going to give this game a nine, however, after reading that Nintendo will be offering a ""hard mode"" as dlc, which is something that should be in the game for free or not at all, I had to knock the score down to an eight, offering a difficulty setting as paid dlc, is absolutely ridiculous. Overall though, I would file this game under ""excellent"", and highly recommend it to anyone who hasn't played it yet.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Tysw2,17-04-2017,"I own Master Edition and beat the game with all 120 shrines. I am a very huge fan of Zelda and Nintendo. This game is great, but not perfect and has clear flaws. Overall this game struck me as the ""Metroid Other M"" of the Zelda series. I'd give it an 8/10 generously.﻿

[The words below should not impact your opinion of the game]

Things that improve gameplay in my opinion: Open world, complete anything in any order, complete 100% freedom, very smart advanced AI, stunning graphics, challenging bosses, abundance of characters and quests.

Things that detract from gameplay in my opinion: Distanced character relationships, little reward for completing a puzzle, lack of concrete and engaging lore, lack of structure to puzzles.

My personal opinion on what could be done to improve the game: Do not allow link to eat during fights, replacing the 120 shrines with full dungeons which would leave us 8 full dungeons, korok seeds could effectively replace shrines, and build a better relationship with the characters that are alive.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
R7valero,05-08-2017,"Sin ninguna duda es juego con mayúsculas, y probablemente el mejor Zelda hasta ahora, y por qué no, uno de los mejores juegos de la historia. Añadirle un mundo abierto me ha encantado. He pasado horas y horas solo observando el mundo y descubriendo nuevos detalles, incluso dejando muchas veces en un segundo plano la historia principal.
Me ha gustado mucho esta nueva forma de jugar, le sienta muy bien. El sistema de combate ha mejorado, y al principio es muy frustrante, ya que se hace complicado debido a los pocos items que poseemos. Quizás ésto sea una pega, pues si al principio es complicado, mientras más avancemos en el juego se nos hará todo más fácil, prácticamente no moriremos (Ganon no se convierte en un gran desafío que digamos).
Otra cosa que echo en falta son las mazmorras, están ahí, pero no me han convencido mucho. Habría estado mejor las típicas mazmorras cerradas con salas y con muchos rompecabezas, es decir, igual que siempre, ya que eran muy desafiantes. Los jefes son algo lamentables, siempre tienen el mismo patrón.
Pero como conclusión final, el juego es formidable. Una auténtica innovación a Zelda que le ha sentado muy bien. No es un juego perfecto, pues no existe uno como tal, pero si roza la matrícula de honor. Grandioso.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
GranP,30-09-2017,"Most people knows the great things on this game, and it´s a 10 to me, but instead of saying the goods and greats, I wanna say like to say fixes/improvements in a sequel. 1 - Enemy variety: I want more kind of enemies, between 3 or 5 more enemies, would be wonderful. 2 - More interesting dungeons: I don´t know how to do it better mechanically, but visually can be enough, they looked all the same, and it was kinda sad. 3 - Difficult scaling bosses: Normal enemies had that, as you defeat the main dungeons you find buffed weapons and stronger enemies with more ease, now back to the bosses, they are easy, so how about making them stronger and have more strategies as you defeat them, after all wasn´t ganon supposed to be gathering strenght? 4 - More animal interactions: I wanted to mount on ostriches, cows, domesticate wolves like the amiibo, but couldn´t. 5 - Important weapons: wasn´t the champions ballad supposed to be great? their weapon break so fast to the point it´s almost pointless to make them again, how about giving a quest to make them unbreakable like the master sword. 6 - Minor things: Maybe a book for recipes, a fast cook option if you just wanna cook 10000 apples at once.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Ironfalcon997,28-01-2023,"There are good video games, there are great video games, then there is The Legend of Zelda series. Sure not every game has reached such heights that the series usually strives for, but as a general rule, this series stands as one of the crown jewels in gaming. Regardless of how impactful they are at the time, they are almost always one of the most polished, fun games of the year when they come out. That is the legacy of this series. Breath of the Wild puts all of the Zelda games that came before it, as well as all preceding open-world games, to shame. As Ocarina of Time caused the world to see what games could be in its time, Breath of the Wild has shown us the pinnacle of gaming in the modern generation. The biggest way that it does this is through its incredible, gigantic world. everything feels so organic. The world is so alive with wildlife, npc's and enemies around every turn, but placed in a way with just enough empty space so that it feels real. The atmosphere is unlike any other in a video game. I would sometimes be so engrossed in it that I would, for a second, forget that I was just playing a video game. This is thanks not only to the excellent atmosphere, but to the way that everything interacts with everything else. The AI and systems of the game, such as weather and physics, all work together with each other in countless incredible ways. It becomes even more inviting and awe-inspiring when you realize how many ways that you can interact with the environment. Taking advantage of fire, weather, terrain, physics, and other things, you can easily find multiple ways to defeat whatever is in front of you, whether that be enemies, puzzles, or even exploration. It feels so real. It also helps that the world is so beautiful, everything shines in a very unique and colorful light, inviting you in. Make no mistake though, this game is not easy and will present you with the challenge necessary to make any goal you want to achieve satisfying. The 120 shrines that are scattered throughout the world are masterfully made and a joy to play, as are the dungeons. The towns and npc's are very dynamic and lots of fun to mess around with. The fact that nothing is required and you are not pushed in a single direction is incredibly liberating. My first 40 hours with the game were solely exploration and everything felt rewarding. The game manages to expertly keep you feeling that joy of exploration even after you complete the game. I've played around 160 hours, gotten all the shrines, dungeons, side quests, and fought the final boss 3 times and I still love just running or riding around the world. So many awesome moments have happened, both through the natural systems of the game as well as through amazing things that they set in the world for you to find. However, no game is without its flaws and Breath of the Wild has a few. The story, while good, could've used some more development and the voice acting ranges from pretty good to cringeworthy. The frame rate takes some hits from time to time, but this was largely fixed with a recent patch. That being said, these few flaws are not near enough to remotely soil an otherwise flawless and masterfully made game. The Legend of Zelda as it was in 1998 has finally returned. This is the open-world game to beat. This is the adventure game to beat. This is the game to beat. It is the rare treasure that seems to transcend gaming and its tropes and give us an adventure beyond our wildest dreams. This is most definitely my favorite game in this generation and, after sinking about 160 hours into it, my favorite game of all time. If you like open-world games, adventure games, games in general, or even just the idea of adventure and freedom, you must play this game.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

flowbeus,06-09-2017,"I just finished this game and it was the most fun I've had in quite a long time playing a video game. I put in over 200 hours taking my time and enjoying the world.

This game's great strength is the freedom to choose the way you want to play the game and to concentrate on those parts of the game you find enjoyable and deprioritize the other aspects. Don't like combat? You can easily avoid enemies most of the time. Don't like horses? Don't use them. Want to check out the flying beast in the sky? Go ahead. The game doesn't force you to do things you don't want to do and instead let's you do those things you find fun. As a result, it accommodates each individual's gameplay style and creates a more enjoyable experience. You end up learning all the aspects of the game by osmosis rather than forced tutorials as those parts you were hesitant to try out are gleaned at a natural pace tailored to the individual. This freedom really works and we're going to see this more and more in the gaming industry.

The weapon durability is PERFECT. It's one of the best parts of the game. I had zero problems with the weapon durability system even from the start of the game. That tree branches and crappy weapons break easily is brilliant. Every difficult enemy has a weapon so there are always more weapons to choose from. By even mid game I was overflowing with great weapons, especially since I was using arrows half the time as well. The weapons mid game last quite a long time too. A killed two silver lynels with one savage lynel club and it still didn't break. The best weapons in the game are all easily re-retrieved. Just go back to any ""major test of strength"" (labeled on your map as such) and get 3 ancient++ weapons. Go back to hyrule castle for the royal guard series. Kill some lynels for awesome clubs, shields, swords and bows. Don't worry about losing your good stuff, because you can easily get it back and you do naturally throughout the game.

The combat is the best Zelda combat ever. I really like skyward sword's motion controls, but there is so much going on with BOTW that I think it is superior. I really like the bow bullet time and the flurry rush, the parrying and dodging, the use of lightning, fire and ice weapons to handle tough situations, the use of bombs, magnesis and statis to mess with enemies, the stealth kill options, bomb arrows, etc, etc. The controls for combat are intuitive, fast and direct. Switching weapons is very easy once you get used to it, and I often use the weapons pop-up menu mid-combat to change weapons based on the situation. I think this is perfect and adds to the strategy.

Other positives: foraging is a ton of fun and makes exploring the nooks and cranies of the world very enjoyable. The clothing aspect and the buffs they provide are really great. It's a lot of fun to get that next piece of clothing. The weather system is really cool, and I really like that you need some kind of plan to survive in certain biomes. the rain is sometimes annoying, but I wouldn't change it. It really is only a problem in the south and east parts of the map and usually you can build a fire or monitor the forecast to avoid these situations. Also, climbing in the rain is an art-form that you can get better at. The horse system works really well. The cooking is great.

Some negatives. My main criticism with this game is that it would be better with more content. More enemy variation, dungeons and towns. More everything. But when your main criticism is that the game needs more content, but it already easily supports 100+ hours it's not really a bad thing. However I do think that certain parts of the map need more stuff going on. More towns and outposts, more interesting involved quests (like the Yiga clan confrontation).

The music that is there is good. However I think in a game so big, there needs to be more default overworld music. There should be more variety of ambient music for the different parts of the map (even beyond the weather-dependent music). But I think the default overworld music needs to be a bit more melodic. It doesn't have to be overpowering music. The places that do have music (the towns, hyrule castle) are much more enjoyable for it.

The story is not bad although I would have liked to see a bit more development of the side characters, especially the present-day ones. The voice acting is a mixed bag.

Opening treasure chests, finding something, and having it close again AUTOMATICALLY if you don't have space for the item is bad. There should be an option to drop an item without having to reopen the chest. This should be patched with a menu option to toggle this new behavior.

Overall I can comfortably declare that this game is a masterpiece, for all the things it does right, and since the detractors amount to nothing in comparison. It's the most astonishing and innovative experience I've had in gaming in quite a while.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The art and the graphics are beutiful and the physics are incredible. The music is another department that Im happy with. Every score joins and fits every moment in a perfect way, which makes the experience even better. Every aspect in this game is made carefully. Now, though, it doesn't reach Ocarina Of Time throne. The story is not impressive and the characters won't become iconic in time. And although the music score is great, it doesn't have remarkable melodies that never age In any case, you never get tired or revisiting the game and there is so much to do and collect, that you can spend a year and maybe more trying to complete the 100% of the game.

The only problem with this game is that the game is a little cheap at times. Spoiler alert ->
For example, at the end of the divine beast Rutah, what you have to face is just annoying and it gets repetitive, and if you get hit you're basically automatically dead, even with good armor. And you can't even start from halfway through or anything if you die at the last stretch.

I loved the feeling I got when I just was walking around and just step into a story mission. I hear a lot of people say this is like HZD, and I played that game and these two are nothing alike. HZD is a pretty game, sure, but Zelda is a beautiful game with vast land and rich environments. People complain that it is too empty and I don't think those people actually played the game because there are towns and villages everywhere. The only thing that really bugs me, but I also love, is the weapon destruction system. I love how it forces you to try out different weapons that you would never try before, but it is rather inconvenient when it happens. I hate people comparing this to HZD, or any open-world game released in the last 7 years, this is not just any open world game, there is no hand holding, the game does have hints to how to do certain things like parrying, but you have to find those or just teach yourself how to.

You start off in a weird somewhat scary enclosure, and then awaken to a bright fantastic world filled with amazing trees, animals, waterfalls, and tons upon tons of more beautiful scenes. The game has a very good story mode which pulled me in and got me hooked emotionally on the characters within the game. The exploration in the game is off the charts, creating hot, cold, and stable environments that are not only huge, but have effects on you whenever you cross into them! You can die of drought, freeze to death in a cold area, or even fall off a mountain or drown in water! The game takes Zelda and reality and mashes them together to create not only one of the best exploration games, but breathtaking adventures as well.

I usually consider $1 being worth at least an hour of game-play. If this was the case for this game, I would've payed about $170 for this game, and you know what? It's still worth it. Graphics don't need to be 4k beautiful like-real life to be good, even with the limits of the switch, Nintendo somehow made the game look like it was a high budget animation at all times. The voice acting is a bit iffy, but it doesn't take away from the experience. Climbing a mountain feels like a journey in itself. The size of the map alone is taunting you to spend more time to find secrets and shrines. Great game, recommend it to everyone who doesn't and does have a switch.

Rockythedog,27-10-2017,Simply a masterpiece. You get so much for your money with this game as it’s difficult not to spend tens to hundreds of hours in the game without even completing half of what’s on offer.

However these complaints are very minor in an otherwise breathtaking game,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Kallenovsky,18-01-2019,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a mind-blowing experience, but not a perfect one. While it still feels like a Zelda game with its dungeons and puzzle-solving depth, combined with a new open world experience that is simply massive, there are some mechanics to the game that just don't hit the right buttons. For one, it's almost always raining. If you're going to build a game on climbing as an emphasis, you can't have it rain this much. I've read arguments that it rains during specific moments to ensure that you follow a specific path, but then that takes away from the open world experience that they're trying to implement. If I'm going to play something like Ocarina of Time which restricts you from exploring places for a reason, then that's fine, but this is a different beast entirely.

While I love the expansive and desolate world, I also feel that some people have the right to be annoyed with how empty it feels. Yes, Calamity Ganon has destroyed much of civilization in Hyrule, but then why are there so many horse stables close to the most dangerous locations? Couldn't the developers have made more of an effort to add some extra villages or towns instead so many stables? It's a repetition issue now. The problem that villages and towns feel less populated than they do in a game like Skyrim is quite alarming for a game of this magnitude and effort.

These issues aside, because we won't even touch the minimal ending and strange continuation feature, the mechanics and core game play are fantastic. Fighting particularly feels like you need to work hard to perfect and it never feels cheap. The difficulty to this game is just right, offering a wonderful balance for all types of players, but be aware that you will die—a lot. It's less frustrating though and more of an ""okay, I get what I did wrong here"" type of experience when dying.

Additionally, this game is flat out beautiful. It doesn't need to look realistic when it looks like you're playing through an animated film. The character models are mostly excellent (don't look at anyone's hands, it's a Zelda game!). The soundtrack is minimal, but done in such a fantastic way. There is little to hear in the world, until you meet certain enemies or reach certain moments. Then it all comes together and makes those experiences all the more wonderful. Plus, all of the hidden gems throughout the open world are enough for older Zelda fans to shed a tear or two along the way to sealing away the darkness.

Breath of the Wild is certainly worth its full price tag, even without any Zelda-branded amiibos or the DLC. It's a complete game that was worth waiting for. Pick it up or you will regret it.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I am not kidding i completed the whole game on both the Switch and WII U because it was so addicting. There is so much to do in this game, heck you can go to the final boss at the start of the game. The new shrines were really fun to find also! But the divine beasts could have had more to do in them but whatever their still fun to beat, and the bosses were kinda easy but cool.

CharrPlayz,25-07-2017,"Short review: It's good, buy it.

Long review:
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a very good game.
Graphics: 9/10, The graphics are very nice, I feel like it gave the game a brighter feel whereas if it was super realistic the story may have felt a little darker.
Gameplay: 10/10, The gameplay starts off different than a normal Zelda game. The main difference being different classes of weapon, weapon durability and weapons with varying amounts of damage. The durability to some may be a dealbreaker to some however in my experience I had too many weapons and spent time deciding which weapons to toss out.
Story: 5/10, In the beginning, the ENTIRE story is given to you. The story is very simple but there is definitely some lost potential. The short story does compliment the idea of going wherever you want and doing whatever you want.
Music: 4/10, There is one reason the score is so low. There is good music when you get to listen to it. The problem is there is no music while exploring the world besides the occasional notes played on a piano.
Dungeons (and shrines): 6/10 (and 9/10 for shrines), There are 4 dungeons and 120 shrines. The shrines are short and sweet with simple puzzles and a nice break in exploration. Dungeons are longer than shrines but aren't any harder. The more you replay the game the more you start to dislike the dungeons decreasing the replay value.
Secrets: 10/10, The secrets in the game are both well hidden and not hidden. ""Korok seeds"" are not too hidden after you figure out a pattern to where they are hidden. Shrines are hidden well sometimes and you feel rewarded when you do find them. Chests are both well hidden and contain good gear.
Combat: 9/10, The combat is like no other Zelda game. The damage of weapons are different per weapon, weapons break, different classes of weapons and a new form of parrying. The enemy does a significant amount of damage and will kick your butt if you're not careful. You will get a lot of game overs your first time.
Misc:
In docked mode on the Switch, there is some frame loss sometimes but this doesn't occur in handheld mode.
The bosses are fairly easy to understand and have a ""rinse and repeat"" style making them overall redundant and time-consuming.
The difficulty in this game is extremely more difficult than past Zelda games. There is little to no ""hand holding""
There is a stamina gauge which appears and can be annoying unless you use a glitch known as whistle sprinting.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Link2910,28-07-2017,"Breath of the wild is a great game. The legend of Zelda is my favourite game series and I have played almost every game. This game is not perfect, but it is a really good effort from Nintendo to bring back the open world theme to Zelda, coming from the original. Some of the reviews I've read have said that the world is empty, but I have to disagree. I usually spend hours a day distracted by all the things you can do apart from the story in this game. There are a few issues, like frames dropping sometimes, but this is only a small inconvenience and most of the time it runs smoothly. The graphics are alright and when music does play it is great. My advice would be to not get a switch just for this game if you already own a Wii U. Switch version looks a tiny bit better than the Wii U version, but that's all really.

Mattcritic1133,11-08-2017,"So. I tried this game NEVER playing a Zelda game, (I probably checked the demo of twilight princess in E3) and never in my life I expected this thing. The first part of the game shut Me up, because of it's beautiful, and colorful world. When the story wanted to progress in a game, I wouldn't do the objective and try to do something before a part of the story progressed. That is what first caught my attention when i bought the game. It was that feeling of real life, and how the game lets you go your own path.
The pacing of the game kinda overwhelmed me at first, -because almost every other game wants you to do what they tell you- but after playing for 3 or so hours, I felt like I was actually in a quest to actually DO something. The atmosphere of the game was almost like people, it looks beautiful and cheerful, but when you find out the truth, the world will never be the same in your eyes. And THAT'S what i call true immersion. It's not about how much the game makes you do in real life, or how the actions of the character have to feel important. It's that connection between the character and you, how the world around you makes you feel. What YOU BELIEVE IN!

In the Arc of the story was where my 10/10 was gone, though. I've seen reviews that only because of one thing they hate the game, ""BUT"" -And i quote but- it did make me feel a bit empty on story. It feels like most of the developer's heart was put into immersion, and not story. I say this because, I know I'm not a Zelda fanatic , but the story wasn't something that made you feel a great emotion, sure it had it's charms, like the whole Zora arc, or putting the pieces of the backstory back together. But it doesn't make you FEEL anything big, like when you play Outlast, you came in as a reporter trying to get a scoop because this guy told him some weird stuff was happening, and he comes out DEVASTATED trying to fight for his life, and you feel the pain of everything that is going on, and when you piece everything together and you get that, ""wait, what?"" moment, it's over. But getting back to the subject, the story didn't make anything different in the Zelda franchise. (and YES I know i sound like a hypocrite for saying i never played Zelda, but i have seen walkthroughs or let's plays, so please don't expose me...)

The gameplay felt like dark souls in a weird matter. It felt like every move you made you made in dark souls, and that doesn't mean it's horrible now. The main reason i liked BOTW was because of the weapon breaking system. I seriously don't know why people hate it, I know it can take away your best sword, but i makes you think fast, and it always makes you be careful with what you use. (Like if you were fighting a monster horde with a damaged sword it really catches you off guard.)

On gameplay, i would do a 10/10. In immersion and what the game was aiming for, 10/10. And in story, I would do a 8.5/10.

Remember that this is all MY opinion, and I don't know what your opinion is or not. Thanks for reading, and may the Triforce be with us.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jelp09,11-09-2017,"I have finished the game, all 120 shrines and entire main quest + memories, did not get all of the korok seeds.

The game is great but a solid 7/10 and not 10/10. As others have stated the breakable weapons and cooking become chores after awhile, but this is not game-breaking.

The worst part of this game is the enemies make no sense at all. I've been killed more times by Lizalfos, Bokoblins, and Lynels than EVERY Ganon sub-boss and final boss combined. It should not be this way. Ganon and sub-bosses should not be way easier than garden variety enemies. Major flaw in the game that I really don't like. When I first encountered a Lynel I died 42 times over the course of 3.5 hours before finally beating it. One Lynel! I think all of the sub bosses and final boss took me maybe 40-60 minutes combined and I died maybe 10-15 times overall.

For those who say the world feels empty- it is supposed to be empty!!! Calamity Ganon destroyed most of the world 100 years ago when Link wakes up at the start of the game!! The overall atmosphere of the game is beautiful. You feel alone, weak, and overwhelmed by a massive gorgeous world. Gerudo wasteland + desert feels like a desert. Scorching hot during the day and freezing cold at night. Death Mountain area / Goron City / the mines are so well done. Again, you feel the heat and fire. And I love the original NES Zelda Level 9 music that plays in the Goron mine areas and Death Mountain trails, and Gorons hum along to it at times. Subtle touch and really well placed. Lake Hylia area is beautiful with the massive bridge. Faron region feels like a steamy jungle. Hebra and other snowy regions are bleak frozen tundras and mountains. You feel like you're at the edge of the world. Zora's Domain is beautiful, that's all that needs to be said. Hyrule Castle feels massive as it should. Best iteration of the castle yet. Overall the environments in this game are jaw dropping.

The music- yes I would love better background music. But it adds to the sense of loneliness that is the overall theme of the game. The music inside divine beasts is really good. It gets louder and more intense as you progress which adds to the excitement.

Overall I give it a 7/10 due to the nonsensical enemy difficulties compared to sub-boss Ganons and final boss Ganon, weapons system, and the lack of proper dungeons is annoying. 120 shrines is excessive and tedious at times. Not a perfect game by any means but it's a lot better than 90% of the junk out there.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Retro_indepecat,30-08-2017,"It's THE masterpiece of that industry, BUT: MORE MAIN MISSIONS AND MORE MUSIC, PLEASE! It's what I miss from this game... but yes, after more than 115 hours of game, I can say what I said, it's THE masterpiece of that industry.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
omega-point,01-09-2017,"I waited a while to try and put in a level headed review - if I reviewed it in March or April I would have said 12/10 and been totally un-objective. Still though, overall the game is great and deserves a 9 or 9.5 since most my complaints are trivial and I haven't had this much fun with a game in years.

Let's start with the bad:

- Very little replayability. The master quest is a nice addition, and we can wait on the next batch of DLC, but since you arent developing different builds or skill trees like other RPGs, the variety in playing the game is limited to which direction you head at first, but there are no new surprises if you played it through the first time.

- Minor frame rate drops, but almost entirely fixed by patches

- Dungeons are underwhelming. Unmemorable, but cool ideas in their structure. If the interactivity could be developed into a longer dungeon experience (like the Stone Temple in Majora's Mask) then they would be much better

- No/very few big items later in the game. Sure there is the master sword and Hylian shield, and the slate upgrades, and the armour... but the lack of unique items or runes for the slate after the plateau reduced the amount of continuous gameplay evolution that most zelda games are iconic for

Decent things that have been done better elsewhere:

- Weapon system was limited. I am a BIG fan of the breaking weapons mechanic, especially since it made me use a huge variety of equipment. That being said, no repair/reinforce system, and no ability to upgrade (seriously, with all the materials out there and the fact that there is ALREADY an armour upgrade system and they didn't expand it to weapons?!). Dark Cloud and Dark Cloud 2 still hold the benchmark for weapon durability.

- Voice acting (english version). Most were fine but Zelda was inconsistent and not great at times.

- Story. I like that it was subtle and had to be searched out. I wish Ganondorf was more fleshed out than just ""evil entity"". That being said, motivations were clear and, well, motivating.

- Enemies. They were constant throughout as far as variety and difficulty (which scaled to the character). There was a slight change by area (lizalfos were electric in desert, ice in snowy areas, firey in death mountain, etc.) but some unique area-specific ones would have been nice.

Great things that deserve the praise:

Design. Its breathtaking and diverse and beautiful.

Weather mechanics. An entire area can be completely different pending the weather. The restriction on climbing with rain makes you explore new options

Climbing/Hang gliding is the best innovation and implementation of such a great idea in an open world game. No restrictions, plenty of vantage areas, and rewarding outcomes. It has changed the game.

Physics and Combat. It rewards skilled play and smart thinking. There are unique solutions and the game embraces the engine, not trying to restrict the player from any loopholes and instead embracing them.

World building. The villages, environments, characters, side quests, and easter eggs are all so well fleshed out, diverse, and engaging. No fetch or escort quests.

Music. Its subtle but very fitting. It fits the game perfectly.

Gameplay: almost flawless. Despite the aforementioned frame-rate drops, you know that if you're getting hit/hurt/falling/failing/dying then you are the one at fault. No blaming glitches here.

Over all: The experience of playing this game through the first time is a feeling I can only describe as all the best parts of the best games I know: The ""Zelda"" balance of A Link to the Past, the open world wonder of Fallout/TES, the exploration vibe of Wind Waker, the physics of Little Big Planet, the combat difficulty emulating Dark Souls (at least in master mode), and the polish of Bioshock. 10/10 for fun I had, 9/10 for an objective review.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
thecleansing0,02-09-2017,"i was never into the Zelda series before Breath of the Wild, and i think this game is amazing for anyone, despite your knowledge on Zelda. this game has intrigued me to learn more about Zeldas history and play the other games of the series. it has wonderful graphics that are a mix of toony and realistic, and amazing game play that is really smooth. challenging bosses and fun enemies, extremely emotional backstory, you truly get attached to these characters . this game truly makes you feel as if you're living it in Links shoes. this game is everything i have ever wanted in a video game, the huge open world that you can explore every inch of! its not a hand-holding type game at all, which i love. you could go straight to the final boss with a tree branch as a weapon if you wanted to. overall, this game is fantastic and i recommend it to anyone who has the chance
the only downsides I've experienced were some of the motion controls, and some of the voice acting, but even then, it doesn't effect the game for me in the slightest, i still think this game is perfect and everybody should have a chance to play it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
IBARRAN,03-09-2017,"Voy a ser claro es el primer zelda que juego, pero creo que puedo opinar que es un zelda muy completo con horas y horas de entretenimiento con mucha variedad con un mapa que esta vivo de verdad y no esta puesto por poner, la única pega que le puedo sacar es que no creo que hubiera costado nada poner un poco mas de historia y mas voz a los personajes pero aun así creo que es un 10 de 10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BMO,04-09-2017,"A fantastic open world game that doesn't try to impose on you when you start to explore. it's hard to put into words the experience I've had with the game. The visuals are nice, and each area has it's own distinct feel to it. The only issue is the frame dips that occur only occasionally. The lack of musical soundtrack only adds to the atmosphere of exploration, with the melodies changing depending on the situation. The biggest gripe to be had with the game is the content masked behind the paywall of amiibo's, in addition to the fact that you may not get what you paid for for days, as it's a random chance if you get the amiibo exclusive weapons/gear. In addition, although the game doesn't require any grinding, for the completionists, farming the dragons to acquire star fragments is extremely tedious, as many armor sets require them to upgrade. I'll end this review by stating I look forward to the DLC coming at the end of the year.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
StrickenLoki92,08-02-2022,"It is a very good game but I have some complaints, regarding the core mechanics this game nails it, traversing the world and the freedom that you have doing so, combat, cooking, crafting, enemies all of that is perfect, but what does make this game not perfect? THE STORY AND THE WORLD, first and most important the story its pretty neat but it's not great nor memorable (The only memorable or important parts is the begging, the end and the zora's domain, heck you can even skip everything in between and go directly for Ganon's head in your first hour and complete the game) very few characters have little to no background for many of them (Little background: The champions, No background: every other character pivotal or semi important to the story) regarding the world that was the biggest let down for me starting with thing to do, yes there are some secondary quest and hidden quest but for a world so big and so fun to traverse those do not make up for it, there's only like 3 villages and some camps around the map everything else is filled with mindless shrines and korok seeds for me that was the biggest mis opportunity, finding bosses or high level enemies in open areas instead of a cool dungeon (Zelda style, a linear dungeon like Skyrim's would be pretty bad for zelda's genre) with a secondary mission and a reward attached to it; But thanks to that Im really hyped for BOTW 2 I strongly believe the sequel is going to be FAR superior that the first game they have a very big room for improvement story wise and world wise. P.S I didn't played the extra DLC maybe it has more story but if a game's core story depends on DLC I don't want nothing to do with it.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
nitorita,16-12-2020,"In an era dominated by open-world RPGs that recycle the same side quest-filled exploration formula popularized by Skyrim, Breath of the Wild stands out by offering simplistic combat combined with a picturesque world. This game takes a hands-off approach by allowing the player to pave their own path in the world.

Being able to climb virtually anything and having access to every upgrade within the first hour or two, you have the freedom to travel anywhere. You get absorbed into this world and it is hard to put your finger on why. The raw feel of the game and the simple nature of it is refreshing. Interactions with NPCs in the world feel natural as well. And even when it doesn't feel like you are doing much, time flies without you noticing. You truly get a serious case of ""one more minute"" as you play this game.

This game emphasizes engaging exploration while slimming out the fat of complex RPG mechanics that other games squeeze in to extend game time. Never have I once played a game where the goal is to simply explore and find something new around every corner. This game is meant to be enjoyed at your own pace.

Now, one thing to keep in mind is that if you want to maximize your enjoyment of this game, resist the urge to split off from the main quest until you've unlocked the Camera upgrade. I personally split off at the very first instant that I could and did not do that, and by the time I explored the entire map and returned back to do so, all of the features introduced by the main quest became obsolete and I missed out on a massive portion of the game.

In terms of where this game plainly falls flat, it would be in difficulty scaling. In the beginning, your curiosity gets the better of you as you roam all over the world trying to discover every nook and cranny. However, eventually this gets old as most locations in the world are unnecessary for progression and don't offer anything particularly incentivizing to promote further exploration, and the monsters and items don't factor in your time played, so they tend to be pointless in the later game.

Overall, Breath of the Wild introduces a unique approach to open-world games that is initially incredibly addictive, but there is much more room for improvement for the world that Nintendo could have easily capitalized on. This game is realistically more like an 8.5, but I've given it a 9 simply because of how unique it was.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

JayTheZoomster,10-09-2017,"This game is, without a doubt, the best Zelda game since arguably, ever. This game features a sprawling world, fantastic visuals, a heartbreaking story, and one of the best experiences in gaming. The first area, the ""great plateau"" acts as this games tutorial but it is far from that as it is a rather a preview of what's to come as it is a sprawling landscape with multiple environments kept into a tiny circle. It teaches the player what to do without forcing them to do it and only makes you do four things to leave. And once you do leave, oh boy it's fantastic, There are 120 shrines, 70 side quests and 900 korok seeds. Along with a main story that will have you trekking through the vast world and boarding Divine Beasts which basically act as this game's dungeons. And my oh my are they fantastically designed. They, along the open world itself, force you to make use of your environment to solve the puzzles and finish the dungeon. The shrines act like this too but are usually 1-4 room mini dungeons and I love those just as much. I'm 103 shrines in and still love everything about hunting them down and solving the puzzle for a spirit orb. It's just so satisfying!

However, amidst my praises are a few shortcomings, the game has a ton of places that are very long and open, namely the desert and the snowy mountains. And while they aren't completely empty, with shrines and side quests, they still feel like they drag. The music in this game is also not nearly as great as previous titles, even if it is still pretty solid. There are too many ""test of strength"" shrines. Seriously, there are 20 of those. Dial it back Nintendo. And lastly, it rains too damn much in this game, I like that you can't climb while it rains, it adds realism but my God I want to at least progress and it's hard when I have to sit and wait for the rain to stop.

My very last complaint would have to be centered around Link himself, Link is usually meant to be the ""link"" between the player and the game, hence his name, but in this game his name is actually Link and you can't name him. While I know this was done so that they could use voice acting, I still feel like he doesn't feel like a link between us anymore. And if they were going to make him a straight up character, he should've at least talked. Some of the other Champions don't have a lot of character development either but I hope that's fixed in future DLC.

Overall, this game is a strong 8/10. One of the best games I've played and definitely the best Zelda game I've played. If you haven't played the game yet--what are you doing?",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
meloquem,11-09-2017,"This might be one of the best game I've ever played. Having said that, there are things I missed that could've made it the all-time greatest.

1. Cutscenes. They could've explored characters a lot more than they did. The game is beautiful. The scenarios, the artwork, the lore, everything. But there's an unnecessary shallowness in the story that could've been prevented by just a few more script lines. I just finished the game and, though I loved the entire 100-hour-experience, I really felt that there was something missing after the final fight with Ganon. My feeling was ""Is it really over...?"". I know storylines have never been the core of Zelda games, but after all this game offers you, it deserved a bigger ending. Definitely a longer script would make it memorable. And by longer I don't mean just throw in a bunch of words as they did in Skyward Sword. It's more about timing and build ups. Take Shadow of Colossus as an example.

2. Cooking system. Holy **** No need for explanation. If you've played this game, you know what I'm talking about. I can take the whole having-to-open-inventory-to-change-bow-when-it-breaks but the cooking system really needs some polishing.

3. Over-rewarding beginning. I understand why they give you every important tool you'll need in the first hour of gameplay. I think it is amazing they managed to pull off an entire world where you can solve hundreds of situations in different ways from the start. I really love the experiment of a truly open world where the things you have don't really matter and I know they've put so much effort into details. BUT I feel that if they've done it differently, I'd feel more rewarded throughout the game. In the Plateau, I didn't even get to enjoy the magnet (which is amazing, by the way) when I got it. It was like ""oh, ok, bombs"", ""oh, right, water freezing power"". Come on, all those skills are amazing and I feel they're taken for granted because the game doesn't even make you need them first. Made me feel like a spoiled kid that doesn't really appreciate his toys because he just keeps getting more. My idea? Just imagine: four extra main quests that would give you each of the main tools (same dynamic of the Divine Beasts storyline). While you don't have them, you'd wander the world normally. Found a wall that needs explosives and have no bomb arrows? Well, better go solve the Sheikah bomb quest storyline. Found a shrine that needs magnets? Tahl Mahol would say: ""You who sets foot on this shrine, come back when you've got the ****ing magnet you **** Or he could say nothing. You could try to solve the puzzle, fail, and then just leave a marker on your map for when you have the tools you need. This would make people strive more and give them a higher sense of accomplishment, which is the entire point of an open world game IMHO. Not to mention it would make you wander through the same places differently every time you got a new item, which is a recurring great experience in most Zelda games.

4. Diversity. I ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMPLEXITY AND RICHNESS OF THIS GAME'S ENVIRONMENT. I know it has so much in it. And that is why I can't understand why they didn't design a wider variety of enemies and shrines. Why the same Bokobins in different colors throughout the entire world? Why not a wooden-made shrine in the Secret Forest? I know it's an art direction choice and not laziness but, come on, there are 120 shrines. Overall, I feel the uniqueness of the BOTW landscapes and its tiny details overshadows the living things of its world.

TL;DR: In many ways, you can say BOTW takes Zelda and open-world games to another level. It is a great game. But some aspects of it are so great that makes you wonder why others aren't as well.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
UnknownMight,21-11-2018,"The game is great but not a 10 for me unfortunate, it's because there is never a climax. You explore the world and eventually all things come to an end, it's like watching a show where enemies gradually just die. I miss the WOW moments from past Zelda and the sensation of having been through a lot after walking out of big dungeons.
Pros:
- Open World: HUGE world with great sense of exploration
- Great combat system, which amplies the DLC a lot
- fun mini puzzles

Cons:
- complete lack of anything spectacular: From the dull story to underwhelming dungeons. If you are looking to drop your jaws you are wrong here

Si tienes una switch o una wii U y te gusta la exploración y los puzzles, TIENES QUE TENER ESTE JUEGO.

puntos buenos:
+Mundo abierto inmenso, repleto de secretos y de desafíos, muy carismático y con un arte muy agradable que recuerda a las películas del estudio japonés studio Ghibli pese a las limitantes técnicas del wii U.
+Dificultad correcta (ni muy fácil ni muy difícil) y que te obliga a explorar y a progresar como jugador.
+Banda sonora inmersiva y muy variada.
+Santuarios (dungeons) principales y secundarios muy buenos y con grandes recompensas.
+Inteigencia artificial de enemigos sobresaliente.
+Repertorio de armas/ropas/herramientas inmenso.
+Narrativa de la historia principal muy entretenida e inteligente.
+Muchísima rejugabilidad.
+Personajes carismáticos.
+Sistema de combate muy pulido y complejo y aun así accesible para los novatos.

puntos malos:
-30 frames por segundo con caídas ocasionales a 20 (menos frecuentes en la versión de Switch).
-Jefe final un poco decepcionante en cuanto a gameplay.

rokorky07,18-09-2017,"Como gran fan de la saga he de decir que es de los mejores The Legend of Zelda que he jugado en mi vida, y no solo eso sino de los mejores juegos que eh jugado en mi vida. No obstante no considero que sea un juego de 10 y explicare por qué.
Este The Legend of Zelda rompe con todos los esquemas que hemos ido viendo a lo largo de las últimas entregas de la saga, en mi opinión el 90% de los cambio acertados. Lo que más me gusta de este título es como Nintendo ha ultimado hasta el más mínimo detalle del juego, desde el efecto del fuego, rayo, etc. Con cada objeto del reino hasta las conversaciones con los personajes del juego que varían incluso dependiendo del clima que haga, de si está lloviendo o no, etc. Como gran seguidor de esta saga me siento muy satisfecho con el trabajo realizado y orgullo de poder decir que esto es un título de The Legend of Zelda. No obstante soy un jugador que da mucho importancia a la historio de los videojuegos y a como se narra y e de decir que aquí es donde el titulo mea decepcionado un poco. Aunque este The Legend of Zelda tiene detrás una historia increíble, creo que no se ha sacado todo el provecho que se podía y esto viene dado por el hecho de venir explicada mediante recuerdos. Desde mi punto de vista aunque la terminación y el resultado de este método son muy bueno no saca todo su potencial, no un potencial digno de la magnífica historia que se está narrando. Si es cierto que el hecho de haber pasado 100 años desde el cataclismo hace que a cada rincón que llegas del reino te dé la sensación de haber llegado tarde, de que todo lo malo va un paso por delante de ti y de que nunca veras como fue en su momento el reino de Hyrule, lleno de vida y zonas increíbles por descubrir. Esto es algo que te hace sentir mucha empatía por los personajes del juego y por los protagonistas del mismo y te sumerge en el dolor que hubo tras el cataclismo y de lo mal que lo paso la gente del reino y las distintas tribus con la perdida de todo como se conocía. Sin embargo al mismo tiempo este gran punto a favor es uno en contra ya que no te deja sentir al 100% la frustración de Zelda, el dolor del rey por presionar a su hija sin quedarle más remedio, no te deja vivir esta historia al mismo tiempo que trascurría lo cual hace que al mismo tiempo que es muy atractiva sea como in alcanzable, como si te la mostraran a través de un cristal sabiendo que nunca vas a poder experimentarla. Y para mí, aquí, es donde este The Legend of Zelda flaquea y pierde mi 10.
He de decir que al terminar la historia este me decepciono y me dejó como un vacío que me hacía pensar “acabo de jugar a uno de los mejores juegos de la historia pero al pasármelo me he dado cuenta de me falta algo” y ese algo era meterse de lleno en el pasado y en la historia de Link, Zelda y los 4 elegidos, incluso del mismísimo Ganon el cual me parece un personaje fundamental en la saga del cual en las últimas entregas propiciaba una gran empatía hacia el jugador cada vez que contaba su historia y daba los motivos de por qué hacia lo que hacía pero, aquí se resume a un ser maligno que no tiene ni una frase en el título y fue otra gran decepción.
Como fan de la saga solo puedo decir que es un grandísimo juego con grandes novedades, con cada detalle cuidado y pulido por sus creadores, con miles de sorpresas increíbles y sentimientos.

lviada,02-11-2017,"Es un juego que reforma absolutamente la manera de mirar a la franquicia, rompe con muchos de los esquemas que se venían repitiendo desde ocarina of time, pero lo hace de una manera espectacular; apuntando a mas cantidad de jugadores, pudiendo satisfacer a quienes van de lleno con la aventura principal (que no es mas del 10% del juego), a aquellos que se quieren tomar un poco mas de tiempo para ver los arcos argumentales y misiones secundarias de los respectivos pueblos y también para aquellos mas ambiciosos que buscan el 100% del juego, que fácilmente les tomara mas de 200 horas de juego.
El juego madura mucho, desde re formular el sistema de puzzles y repartir los ""templos"" por todas partes del mapeado, lo entretenido y distintas formas de abordar cada combate, el añadido de un sistema de sigilo, la sensación de progreso a medida que vas mejorando tus vestimentas y consiguiendo nuevas armas, la gran manera de abordar la master sword, dándole un protagonismo digno de la saga, sin perder los rasgos de mundo abierto, y incitándote a seguir usando otras armas,
El diseño de las bestias divinas es espectacular, si bien me hubiese gustado ver mayor variedad en los jefes, cumplen, y en el ámbito de la música del juego, son melodías mucho mas complejas de lo que se escucha a simple oído, y pierde mucho protagonismo, ya que le dan espacio a poder escuchar el entorno, el ruido de los animales, pájaros, el viento que le sienta espectacular a este mundo abierto.

Pros
- The characters are well developed, I felt empathy with all of them.
- I've never played a game with such an enchanting atmosphere; it is dark and lonely, which I enjoyed.
- The music goes perfectly with the setting and the atmosphere. It's kind of progressive/experimental music. People complains about the lack of music and other characteristic themes of the franchise, but the ones on game are amazingly composed and designed to be earworms.
- The majority of the puzzles were challenging and fun.
- If you haven't found all the korok seeds and shrines, you already know that there's a lot of replay value in this game.

Cons
- The voice actors in certain characters (like Zelda) felt amateurish, but it's a minor detail.
- The story is good, but I think they could have delivered it in other way. The gimmick of ""finding the memories"" was not a good option.

mdrovell,04-10-2017,"Personally, I can't say I've played too many zelda games, but I did enjoy Breath of The Wild. The beginning was entertaining and very exciting, however, nearing the end of the game, it seemed I became less and less interested in playing it. I believe the main reason why is because the dungeons were bland and the story was just ""meh.""
What I really enjoyed about the game was the art, controls, and just the sheer amount of things to do. However, the latter of the three did become tiresome. The art was amazing and the controls felt natural.
The major con that I would give Breath of the Wild is like stated before the story and dungeons were not entertaining and at one point became a hassle. I did love the champion's stories and the memories, however, it just wasn't enough.
The music in Breath of the Wild was pretty good. It sounded really good and reflected the peacefulness of the game. However, it lacked the music that a traditional zelda game like Oot or Link to The Past had. An energetic over world theme instead of a couple notes on a piano. The only music I noticed that got me hyped was the final boss theme, but even then it didn't last long.
Overall, Breath of the Wild was a great game that gave me lots of fun hours on the weekend, but the flaws can be fixed. I have high hopes for the next game to fix some of these cons that will let players enjoy the game even more. Honestly, I gave this game an 85/100, but it could easily be a 90/100.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Hellsky,22-02-2018,"No sé ni por donde empezar... Este juego ha superado todas mis expectativas y eran altas. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild presume ser el mejor juego de todos los tiempos y puedo afirmar que corto no se queda.

Exhibe un gameplay, mécanicas y controles de ensueño junto a una banda sonora ambiental que simplemente te llama a que juegues hora tras hora sin poder evitar quedarte parado y observar su maravilloso mundo, lleno de vegetación, fauna y puntos de interés donde siempre encontraremos algo interesante.

Otro punto importante es que en este mundo abierto no nos dará ""palo"" ir de un sitio a otro ya que siempre acabaremos encontrando eventos nuevos (jefes, objetos,...) que anteriormente habían pasado desapercibidos. Todo esto es provocado por la inmensidad del mapa de Hyrule que atonta e ilusiona a cualquier mortal.

Por último, cabe destacar que la historia de Zelda Breath of the Wild es simple pero a la vez cumple con su función principal, hacer viajar a nuestro héroe Link por todo el vasto mapeado del mundo.
Mi calificación personal sería de 10 y encuentro que es una compra obligatoria para cualquier fan de Zelda y para cualquier amante de los videojuegos.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

MannWithNoEyes,30-10-2017,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is my favorite open world game, and as of right now is tied with Hollow Knight for 2017 game of the year. Due to the enormous amount of freedom the player is given, the game is an extremely organic experience, and one that has set the standard for open-world games I hope to play in the future. From the very beginning, this game establishes its hands-off approach both in story and in gameplay. The Great Plateau gives very little instruction or direction, and just says: go, and lets the player figure out every mechanic for themselves, which is much more rewarding than any tutorial. Granted, there are way-point markers to guide direction, but because the world is designed so well, with paths being marked with signposts, NPCs giving direction to the player by telling them important locations and their general direction, and mountains and hills adding organic structure to the world, there is very little need for the way-points. Luckily, on pro-hud mode, everything is deactivated except Link's hearts, which delivers an extremely nonlinear experience. By making every area accessible from the very beginning, and by providing many different environments in its tutorial, Breath of the Wild naturally teaches the player the extensive amount of systems in place, each important in its own way. Enemies will be lured away from their camps by boars and other meat. Fire not only hurts the player but also creates an updraft the player can exploit using their glider. Lightning will strike the player during a thunderstorm if they have metal weapons or armor equipped. Rain forces the player to stay on the paths, and pushes the player into more encounters with enemies. The different environments have different temperatures and types of enemies, which forces the player to use different weapons in order to be the most effective in every scenario. These extensive systems allow for so much variation in terms of combat that every single encounter with each enemy feels unique. Nearly every quest area and self-contained level uses a combination of all the systems in the game in order to keep itself unique and distinguished. There are so many options for movement across the world that every journey and voyage feels different, and just as exciting as the last. On the other hand, all but a few of the sidequests are repetitive, but the shrine quests are so varied in terms of gameplay that the flaws with the sidequests are negated. Eventide Island, the Spring of Wisdom, and many of the quests with environmental puzzles are some of my favorite sidequests in any games. The main quests for all intents and purposes, are more extensive sidequests, but all were unique and interesting, offering up new environments with unique obstacles to tackle in every one. The only quest I didn't enjoy was Divine Beast: Vah Medoh. It was too short in my opinion, so when the Divine Beast was eventually brought back under Link's control, it was underwhelming. The Zora area had amazing characters and quite a few touching moments, and the Goron area probably had the most variety in terms of mechanics, but the highlight of the main quest in my opinion was Divine Beast: Vah Naboris. Riju in particular was given quite a bit of depth as a character, mainly due to her diary. The Yiga Clan Hideout section was fun, and did a good job adding humor into an otherwise basic stealth mission. The Divine Beast chase segment was probably the most challenging in the game, but because the game does such a good job introducing the sand-seals to the player on their first trip into Gerudo City, the mechanics used are familiar to the player. The Divine Beast distinguishes itself through its use of electrical currents, and often used one part of the Divine Beast to influence puzzle-solving in a different part, which made the whole area feel cohesive. As a whole, the story on its own is pretty weak, but the item descriptions and ancient ruins add history and depth to the world. Also in my opinion the game implements the best incarnation of Zelda thus far. Skipping the story may seem like a bit of a cop-out, but I love the way it compliments the rest of the game. In other open world games the stories are often far removed from the player's actions. For example in the Witcher 3 there is a serious sense of urgency and necessity from the story, which resulted in me either running past all side quests or breaking the pacing and tone of the story in order to do them, which sort of stopped me from enjoying the game as much as I would have had the tone not been so urgent. Breath of the Wild manages to get around these flaws in a very clever way, however. By allowing the player to skip the story entirely, it removes the barrier between the story and the gameplay, which made the game feel more focused than its companions in the open-world genre. I hope this game is imitated for years to come, so the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is gets a 9 out of 10",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
OneYoutubeFan,07-10-2017,"Alright, I'll say one thing off the bat: This game is not perfect, but it's certainly amazing. I've had this game since March 15th, have played for over 65 hours, and am still nowhere near beating the game entirely. The graphics are amazing, with no frame drops and quick load times for what it's loading. The familiar process has been ditched for an open world adventure, with small puzzles here and there that are a good replacement. Though they're not long, there's a lot of them. This and the divine beasts were a GREAT way to try something new, but still make it the Zelda we all know and love. The massive Hyrule you explore, while not very interesting, is very beautiful. Every little detail can be seen, in each blade of grass, or the reflections off wet rocks. The combat is also very fun, and very quick. You can dodge and do a flurry of attacks if you dodge at the right time. You can also have multiple weapons, and a full load out consists of a sword, shield, and bow. However, they all break, and don't usually have enough durability. This is a bit of a problem, but doesn't get in the way too much unless you run out of weapons in the middle of a boss battle. You are also able to help yourself take less damage and get special boosts using armor, a full set having a helmet, chest clothing, and leg defense. Sets of armor can get boosts, but you can also mix and match. The story is very captivating, but doesn't get told if you don't choose to see it. This is a great compromise for people like me, who love games with a deep story and lore, and for people who just want to have fun exploring, fighting, and being a hero. But for a completionist, I feel bad for you. You need to take photos of every enemy, item, and weapon, find 900 Koroks by solving hard to find and easy to complete puzzles across Hyrule, find all the sub area tags (hello Xenoblade) and you don't get anything for it. Thankfully, the DLC has made finding Koroks a bit easier using the Korok Mask. Overall, I find The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild to be a very fun and interesting experience, if a bit long. It's not for the faint of heart, but is certainly amazing for the hardcore gamer, the average Zelda fan, and gamers wanting to get into open world games without starting with Diablo or Skyrim.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Mystery_Man_Bro,24-10-2017,"Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild has the most vibrant open-world game I've ever played; every where there is distractions to stray you off your course, which is good considering it doesn't feel like running around in a barren desert for an hour to get to your next main quest objective. The creatures and monsters you encounter can kill you in one swipe or fly off a cliff with one hit of your weapon, there is so much freedom in how you fight making a complex fighting system that, even if you have all the hearts in the game, can surprise you and also satisfy you.
The story is very simple, but is also very emotional, and this is finally a Zelda game that its story focuses almost entirely on Zelda. The relationship between Link and Zelda is so interesting that finding every memory is a reward in its self. Yet some of the bosses don't live up to some overworld enemies the farther you get in the game. The climax is up to interpretation, I felt it was very overwhelming but in the end, very easy.
The Shrines are all very different and all very fun, some will teach you something new and others will have you experimenting for hours on what to do. The Korok seeds on the other hand are a little too much, there isn't much reason for them to be there and no reason at all for their to be 900 of them! Side quests take a while, but had a very unique personality and objective for every single one. All of these are great but after completing the story and shrines, completing the after game isn't very rewarding nor apparent for me; I want to complete the game but all that's left is the most boring collectibles and the whole ordeal is very appealing to me.
The game is still great and my first and favorite Switch game by far, but not even close to perfect yet I don't think 8.4 is high enough either...",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Не напрягать новичков хитросплетениями лора, давать им и фанатам делать всё, что вздумается и ловко втюхивать и тем, и другим мысль, что тут никому, ничего не навязывают.

Kick454,27-05-2018,"While BotW isn't my favorite game on the Switch, I feel like I was a bit too harsh towards it. Here is my final review of this game.

Pros:
+ Combat: The weapon durability was poorly implemented, but the Flurry Rush and Time Stop Arrow thing make up for it.
+ Soundtrack: The overworld music sucks, and it reuses songs a bit, but most of the songs are good.
+ Overworld: Empty, but beautiful, though not as beautiful as some other games on the Switch.
+ Hyrule Castle: By far the best rendition of it, and the only good dungeon in the game.

Cons:
- Overworld Music: This is more of a nitpick for me, as I never play it with the sound on anyways. Though I was let down badly after finding out that it was just three piano notes every 2 minutes.
- Dungeons: Excluding the DLC and Hyrule Castle, they were too short and easy as heck.
- Story: C'mon Nintendo, where's that epic story that we were promised in January 2017? The memories aren't enough.

SonsofZeruiah,30-10-2017,"In my opinion this is one of the best Zelda games released. I give it a 10 out of 10, even though it does have its flaws, as I believe the qualities of the game outweigh its flaws.

The Pros:
*The world is amazingly huge, filled with things to do, people to meet, monsters to massacre.
*Collectables are both useful and simplified. Unlike other games like Assassins' Creed or the numerous other open world games out there today, Breath of the Wild keeps the collectables simple and valuable, scattered across the land.
*The trials are amazing, fun, and varied. I hunted down all 120 and only after about 100 of them in did I begin to tire of completing them.
*The variety of combat is awesome. The different types of weapons are very well balanced, with each type having distinct advantages and disadvantages.
*The bonds built between Link and the other characters are some of the best in the series
*The expansion on the armor upgrade system from SS is a great improvement

Cons:
*There are too many Korok seeds and no good rewards for collecting them with over half of them still left to collect
*The weapons durability system breaks weapons too much. To survive, I had to grow to no longer care about what weapons I possessed, which is counter to how I like to play. If the weapons just lasted longer I'd been much happier.
*Four divine beast ""dungeons"" was too few for a Zelda title. MM made this problem was well.
*The horses were functionally useless for me because they were too smart and fought me on the pathfinding.

Overall this game was amazing to play and I did absolutely complete it, with only the last couple hundred Korok seeds a few shrines truly proving more of a grind then fun gameplay.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Lo unico que, para mi gusto, le falto al juego es un poco mas de dificultad, más Bestias Divinas y jefes, y puede que una historia un poco más profunda, porque comparada con la de otros juegos de Zelda no es gran cosa, aunque espero que le den mas profundidad para el 2 DLC.

Jenna4President,15-11-2017,"It's really hard to say that this game isn't perfect... but it's not perfect.

Don't get me wrong. Nearly all of my time spent with it was filled with enjoyment and amazement. The gameplay is so smooth and well thought out, the puzzles really are a challenge at times that put all the other games to shame, I can't get enough of the massive artillery of weapons we have at our disposal and the story was almost perfect.

Almost.

But sadly, there is a huge honking problem with how it all works. That big problem is Ganon. It's not how he's given to you. The form is whatever. I LIKED that... until I realized that was the only part of that fight that would actually be challenging.

Now, humor me.

If you get everything done that you should-- save the divine beasts, get the master sword, do all of the important quests in general, you will be HEFTILY rewarded. Rightly so. Thats fine. You have me understanding so far. But... You have to be aware. This is a long time that you're taking to get all of this done. And all the while you're taking this time, you're enemies are scaling up in level with you, so surely when you get to Ganondorf, you are going to be up against the most powerful foe you've ever faced!

Nope. I expected something different from that. All that time and Ganon is no harder. He's actually easier.. And there is a big difference if you HAVEN'T done everything you could, but that difference is understandable. You have to fight not only Ganon, but all of his blights. Which is hard, especially if you are not a master of the game in any form nor have the right gear. It's the hardest the game can get for the final boss.

So, ganon's form here makes sense. He only has so much power and has had less time, but he's left more prepared with tons more defenses.

Yet, with more time, you can't tell me that he couldn't have gained a more complete vessel. He was absorbing the holy power Zelda had inside of her and was even given a bit more time. He would have been perfectly capable of sapping her entirely of her power, leaving him with a greater form for it. He could have actually been a demigod of pure evil with a renewed mind, thanks to Zelda's Power of Wisdom.

Could have. But didn't.

I also have a problem with the actual ending. This is, without a doubt, the plainest a 3D Zelda ending has ever been for me. We saved the day! Ganon is no more! Zelda is saved! ... And?

The game never answers that question, only humoring you by telling you what MUST happen. Yes, we know that we must rebuild. But what about your people? What do they all think? For all we know, they don't really care. Or the news could have been the greatest the people of the generation have ever received!

That's the whole problem with the ending. You don't get to see this. You are just treated to a congrats and a meaningful moment with Zelda and Link. I didn't forget that. It was nice. I liked that...

I just don't like that you don't even get to continue AFTER you've slayed Ganon. You're just brought back to when you are about to fight him and can do it all over again! How... utterly mundane.

You can't go back and revisit the places you've saved, you can't see what happens afterwards in the near future, you really don't know whether or not this has dealt with the GANON WORSHIPPERS. The story is less resolved than you'd initially think and you aren't really told that flat out. Just that it will ""take time"" to mend all of Hyrule's wounds.

That's my big problem with this game. There could have been just the tiniest bit more to it instead of it literally becoming a sandbox.

Even though I nitpick these issues, I loved the heck out of this game. The story-- or rather, the finale, is what I dislike, which is comparatively tiny when held beside everything else in this game that's done beautifully. I found the tallest mountain, I climbed the tallest mountain. I chopped down a tree. I FLEW on a tree. I hunted down ever last weapon and broke every last weapon.

There is so much to do that a simple bad ending cannot make me hate this game, nor even dislike it. I LOVED IT.

Verdict: I give this game a 9 out of 10. It's so close to being a 10, but I have to take that point away, because it could have been even better. Could have been.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

shawnr,10-11-2017,"PROS:
-Vast world with so much to explore
-Amazing sense of Progression (Weapons, Hearts, Stamina)
-Tons of variety and things to do
-Visually stunning

CONS:
-Hmmm any con would be nitpicking but Links stamina at the start is terrible lol

Where do I even start. Breathe of The Wild does what Ocarina of Time did when it was first released. It defied the standard of games for its generations and many following. BOTW is the biggest adventure we've seen yet in a Zelda game and arguably the best one to date. From exploration, story, Links Progression, and combat, it all works perfectly. Boss fights are epic and allow for players to be creative. Controls are seamless and make exploring easy and fun. Links ability to climb, fight, and get around, is determined by the amount of stamina you have. but here is when it gets interesting. Every time you defeat 4 dungeons you make the decision on if you want to increase your health or stamina. Each are critical but affect whether you can be tougher in battles or ready for bigger exploration. BOTW is an adventure that will last 100s of hours with every corner of the world offering something new. If you didn't have a Switch before this is reason enough to invest in one.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Wraithpk,21-07-2019,"Breath of the Wild is a fun game with an expansive world, nice armor system, some fun puzzles, and some touching story scenes. That said, people FAR overrate this game because of Zelda bias. Here's the bottom line: the game doesn't have much of a story. The few scenes you get are good, but they're way too few and far between.

As for the expansive world, there just isn't a whole lot actually in it. Littering korok seeds and shrines all over the map isn't really content. Especially when a bunch of the shrines are either brain-dead easy and short, or there's no puzzle at all. The shrines become repetitive pretty quickly. They probably should have cut the number of shrines to a quarter of what they have and made each one longer and more thought out, but they tied them to the fast travel system, which was a mistake.

The game really comes down to this: find Link's 13 memories, defeat the 4 divine beasts, then go defeat Ganon. That's it. It's very simple and straight-forward. I just can't give a game that's that shallow when you really look at it a higher score than a 7. It's a fun game to play for the most part, but fun to play alone can't make a game a 10/10. Like, it doesn't compare to other games like Horizon Zero Dawn, The Witcher 3, or the Last of Us, which are also fun games but have immersive story plots that surprise you and move you more than Breath of the Wild does. It's a very good Zelda game, but it makes me wonder if they should play with making more complex stories in Zelda games, because that's the big missing key of this game to me.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

hifumitogo,27-02-2018,"As a newcomer to the Zelda series, this game amazed me in many ways and the contents in this game are actually more than what have I expected. This game deserves all those GOTY awards this year. Played Mario Odyssey, HZD, Nier: A, Persona 5, all GOTY contenders and Zelda BoTW is indeed the better one out of them. But of course there are somethings I simply not so fond of:

1. Completion and rewarding. So I have beaten the game but my % of completion is barely around 20%. I know I didn't hunt for Korok seeds a lot and didn't bother much on those side quests but the % bothered me quite a lot given that I completed all the main quests. All I can say are those activities are not so rewarding for me especially after beaten the final boss.

2. Princess Zelda's voice. Fairly shock for me after my cute, sweet and pretty looking princess said her first dialogue in the game. Don't match with her appearance at all.

3. Climbing while raining. I know this is part of the game but sometimes it just f me hard. AFAIK there isn't any set or elixir that can help with this right?

4. Puzzle. I know solving puzzle element in Zelda series is like stealing car in GTA. But it's quite troublesome for me, precisely the 4 divine beasts puzzle.

In a side note I actually expect more from a game that known by many as game of the decade nonetheless. No offense to this game, but I'm quite disappointed if this is the height a single player video game can reach up to now. I must say it's my expectation is always too high for highly rated games. Don't be mad guys just my opinions :)",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BlueFalcon90,02-12-2018,This Zelda is for sure completely different in regards to past core games in the series. Very open world and takes lots of exploration. The main dungeons and puzzle solving has been split up into mini versions call shrines and will take about 5-10 mins per one. Even the main divine beast dungeons will take 30 mins max for any veteran Zelda player. Overall it is a nice change of pace being able to do any thing you want. Even if you become a master at it you can go and fight Ganon straight away. There are a variety of side quests to keep you busy. You'll probably find yourself going to a target location to only find yourself side tracked with things you find along the way. You will find yourself having to hoard weapons as they do break often. I didn't really have a problem with that as you come across plenty to have in your inventory. One big problem is the rain and how it hinders your progression from climbing anything in the game. Overall the gameplay is pretty tight. Music department is pretty much just a relaxing tone through the entire game. I did enjoy most of the music and I recommend checking out the OST if you get a chance. Story is pretty interesting and the first Zelda game to have full force voice acting. The voice acting isn't top notch but isn't terrible either. All in all it was a joyful experience and some what of a memorable one.

Fhone,15-02-2018,"Before I talk about Breath of the Wild, let me address some things. TL:DR at the bottom

This game brings Zelda back to life. Everyone saying this isn't a real Zelda game are players who are used to the Zelda games with Ocarina of Time's tired playstyle, and let's be honest, it was getting boring and it reached its end with Skyward Sword. Thankfully we got A Link Between Worlds because it broke the cycle of rehashed playstyles. Nintendo played it smart, they kept adding in gimmicks to keep players from noticing that they were playing the same game with different graphics. Skyward Sword had the flight, Twilight Princess had the wolf transformations, and Wind Waker had the traveling. Take those out and it's pretty much Ocarina of Time DLC.

Thankfully Breath of the Wild delievered, I gotta say I would've been a little disappointed if it had the same playstyle that's been used for years. The game does have some missed opportunities and things I would've liked to see (hopeflly they'll be around in the next game), dungeons could've been larger, but the scattered shrines make up for the loss of classic dungeons, some shrines being short, and some being pretty lengthy.

I'm also glad they still kept some classic Zelda things in there while adding in new things, like figuring out the enemy's weakness and figuring out puzzles. This game feels more like the first Zelda than any of the recent releases, open, rewarding, and fun. The game rewards players for their curiosity, and features tons of puzzles to solve and really reminds us of what Zelda is about.

TL:DR - Don't listen to the kids who say this isn't a Zelda game just because they want more OoT rehashes, THIS is a Zelda game. I stopped playing a while ago to play other games, but this is one of my all time favorites and will be remembered for generations to come.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SuperIgun,29-12-2017,"The Zelda series has been one my favorite video game series and Breath of the Wild is my second favorite. The game starts you on the Great Plateau which is a 1-hour tutorial area that shows you how to find shrines, and which one to get to first. It also has many interactive things with enemies, food, boulders, and other objects. Once you get off the Plateau, you have the entire Hyrule to explore; you do not even need to get to the first objective, you could just kill Ganon or explore. The land is also gorgeous and very large. There are lots of side quests you can do; you can do all the shrines, and get all the korok seeds. (There are a lot of koroks.) This game is a masterpiece, but I cannot give it a perfect score. The main story was kind of disappointment at the end, especially the end boss fight. The dungeons are all the same puzzles and look very similar. The Switch version is very optimised, but there are some small drops in framerate which detract from the experience especially in Korok Forest. Although, it got better when the patches came out but still not perfect. (Wii u version has lots of drops.) Even with those problems, Breath of the Wild is a fantastic open world game, and you will have hours of fun. (At least, 100 hours of fun.)",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
LordOMO,13-10-2020,"Groundbreaking but not flawless

Pros: audio and the core gameplay mechanics
Audio in this game is some of the best I've ever heard. Plug in a pair of headphones and immediatly get immersed in the world. The more somber music does a great job of delivering a few accents here and there without overpowering the amazing sound design.

Core Gameplay: This includes so many aspects, but most importantly the movement system and Link's abilities. Breath of the Wild gives the player all the tools they need for near limitless exploration and experimentation.
The fact that you can climb every mountain or swim through every river as long as you have enough stamina (which can be buffed via gear and consumables!) makes similar games feel archaic in comparison. Looking at other open world games like Horizon Zero Dawn it is laughable how many invisible barriers you come across and how limited the climbing system actually is.
Link's abilities are amazing for the fact that they are physics based and can be utilized in every situation you can think of. There is a lot of depth in how you can interact with those abilities and use them in creative ways.
Another interesting but not perfect gameplay mechanic is that even most of your gear functions as a consumable. By forcing you to constantly switch up your load out the game encourages experimentation and prevents players from snatching up high level gear early which would trivialise all of the low level areas. You can of course still do that but when your weapon breaks after two combat encounters you are back to using level appropriate gear. However, there are some faults in the execution of this system, which leads me to the games weaknesses.

Cons: inventory management and a lack of motivators.

Inventory management is a hassle. Every time you want to heal or want to switch weapons or when your weapon breaks or if you want to use an ability you got to pull up some kind of menu. The Nintendo Switch simply doesn't have enough buttons to cycle through all the stuff you'll need during gameplay efficiently. As a result the controls are surprisingly complex and gameplay doesn't always go as smooth as I like. Within one combat encounter that takes maybe 40 seconds it is not unusual for me to pull up some kind of menu 6 times or more. That's me pulling up a menu screen every 5-10 seconds. This absolutely needs to be streamlined in future entries of the Zelda series.

The biggest weakness however is the lack of motivators. Breath of the Wild is a game that has its core mechanics built entirely around exploration. So how come the game world is so empty and has little reward? I understand that people might be motivated to explore for different reasons. Some may explore to collect loot, some may explore to find content (e.g. lore or side quests) and some may explore simply to appreciate the game world. In my opinion Breath of the Wild nails none of these motivators.
Let's look at loot: most of the loot you will find are basically just consumables to replace the consumables you spent or to increase your inventory to store said consumables. To actually grow permanently stronger it is recommended to complete shrines and quests which have a lot of empty space inbetween.
OK, so how about content? Let me be quite frank. There is very little chance that you might stumble across a quest giver or some interesting story event by accident. Yet again, most of the areas are empty except for some cookie-cutter enemies and consumable items here and there.
So, if there is no story reward or rare loot to be excpected when going off the beaten path then surely there must be some beatiful/interesting vistas to be discovered that make the journey worth it, right? This is of course very subjective but I don't think Breath of the Wild is a particularly pretty game. It has a good art style that can hide some of the technical shortcomings. But the game still remains barren and rarely impresses visually. And the most impressive stuff is usually part of the main quest anyway.

All in all I believe Breath of the Wild is an innovative approach to exploration and experimentation in video games. However it is a bit held back by the technical limitations of the Wii U and Nintendo Switch. I can only assume that they needed to spread out the content over so much empty space because the consoles would not have been able to handle a more dense and complex game world. As a result the strong core mechanics hace to carry the game through some of the more boring parts while traversing the game world",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SillySeaMonkey,12-02-2023,Love this game. Big zelda fan from the time of SNES. This is my dream zelda game. 10/10,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Jorgesoman,31-12-2017,"TLOZ: Breath of the Wild es, en primera estancia, un juego precioso. El primer plano del exterior nos muestra un mundo cuidado, con mucha vida en él. A lo largo del juego vemos seres de todo tipo, desde pequeños roedores inofensivos hasta monstruos tremendamente hostiles. Las civilizaciones dejan ver sus culturas, su arquitectura y su historia sin resultar pedante o sin que sature al jugador medio. Te gusta pasear por ese mundo, ir con calma por sus distintos ecosistemas. Precioso.
La jugabilidad del juego se apoya en tres pilares fundamentales:
El ritmo calmado del juego debido a las distancias y a la cantidad de cosas por hacer.
La adaptación de Link a las situaciones y diversas etapas del juego.
La exploración del medio como fin en sí mismo.
Estos tres factores explican el reparto de santuario por todo el mapa, que se descubren a través de exploración. Estos dan recompensas de muchos tipos, así como vida, estamina o equipación. Con estas mejoras, se te permite una mejor exploración, encontrando más santuarios y etcétera. Estas armas son volátiles, es decir, se rompen eventualmente. Por lo tanto, esta situación provoca dos de estos pilares:
Saber escoger el arma en cada momento para su mayor durabilidad (adaptación).
Al romper las armas necesitas buscar otras por el mapa (exploración).
Esta dinámica del juego es simplemente perfecta, ya que unas acciones provocan otras necesidades, y que impulsan a su vez otras acciones. Es, sin más, un círculo perfecto.
La narrativa es la parte más floja del juego, pero sólida al mismo tiempo. Breath of the Wild presenta a un protagonista sin recuerdos de su otra vida, que va encontrando por Hyrule, volviendo al pilar de la exploración. A medida que encuentra fragmentos de su memoria, la historia se nos va revelando. Y entonces, vemos claramente que el juego trata de Zelda y no de Link. En este juego, Zelda es un personaje muy bien desarrollado, a través del punto de vista de nuestro avatar, de nosotros. Se presenta como una persona insegura, a la sombra de un héroe capaz de todo. Ella, la supuesta elegida, no puede parar a Ganon. Es una decepción y una vergüenza para su padre y para todo el reino. Pero ella está luchando desde hace cien años y Link fue derrotado. Quizás hubiese estado mejor que la historia sucediese a tiempo real y no en un flashback. Pero no está del todo mal. Le permite a los jugadores que quieran jugar hacerlo sin preámbulos.
En deifinitiva, estamos ante uno de los mejores juegos del año, técnicamente impecable, con una jugabilidad, aunque no innovadora, sí fresca para la saga, con un mapa basado en la exploración sin límites. Y una historia aceptable para no dedicar sus esfuerzos en ella.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

GollyJeeWizz,26-03-2018,"In a nutshell, this game is for adventurers and those who love to explore. The game rewards those who explores every nook and cranny of the world, and if you're not a skilled player, punishes you for not doing so. I say those who do so are rewarded, and those who do not are punished because the way you find your stamina vessels and heart containers are by exploring and completing Shrines that are littered throughout the massive game world. From obvious locations, such as at ground level in random places, to the top of the Twin Peaks. Some are easy to complete, and others will have you scrambling the internet to figure out how to complete them. There are still Shrines in earlier parts of the game I doubt I will ever complete, either because they are incredibly annoying, or simply because I don't have the patience to search every nook and cranny of the world.

There are over 900 Korok seeds around the world you can use to expand your inventory. These are incredibly precious, as inventory space is hard to come by due to the new breakable equipment mechanic. There are 120 possible Shrines to explore as you make your way around the game world. There are a ton of side quests that will yield extra rupees, gems, and other items. There are treasure chests placed all throughout the world in those places you don't think to look at while playing a video game, such as at the bottom of a pond, or in a cave behind a destructible wall. Needless to say there is enough to do in this world to keep you busy. There are those who have put in 100+ hours into the game who have yet to make it to their first Divine Beast. I've even read about individuals with 500 hours into the game who has yet to finish off and destroy Calamity Ganon. We'll return to that later.

However, with that being said, the story is just as bad as the exploration is good. There's not much that is fleshed out, and what little story we do get in BOTW becomes predictable. You start out waking up from a 100 year nap and found out Calamity Ganon is on the loose and terrorizing the world. You meet up with the last King of Hyrule, and while you are finding all this out the only thing comes into mind is how amazing this adventure is going to be. Unfortunately, all that type is short lived. You learn how to glide after doing the tutorial island, and from there you are told you need to find the four Divine Beasts, as they are the secret to weakening Calamity Ganon so he can be defeated. In fact, skilled players can completely ignore this and go straight to Calamity Ganon, and the main story is over as quickly as it begins.

Without question, BOTW is the best exploration and adventure simulator that has ever been made, but lacks the character of previous Zelda games.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

swissjm,27-02-2018,"Breath of the Wild is a strong entry in the Zelda series. The open world aspect of the game is refreshing and mixes up the formula of past 3D Zelda titles, as well as takes the series back to it's roots. The fact that you can go anywhere and do anything gives you an immense sense of freedom and encourages exploration. You can literally climb any surface, swim any river, and reach anything you see in the distance. You can even go straight to the final boss fight without accomplishing anything else in the game. The ""tutorial"" part of the game on the Great Plataea is extremely well done. The player is given a taste of what adventuring in Hyrule really feels like and sets the player up to succeed with tasks and challenges that flow very well in the narrative and doesn't feel like a tutorial in itself.
Where the game falters is that the scope of Hyrule is so vast that the story is left wanting. Nintendo is first and foremost about game play (and this game plays extremely well), but you never bond with any of the characters outside of Zelda. There is no character development or any relational bond with anyone other than Zelda. There is so much time spent in game exploring and discovering new areas that if there's not a relational component to the story and characters to keep you engaged, then the main story is easily pushed to the side. I like how we are taken along an adventure with Link as he recovers his memories. We discover bits of his past along the way until we have a clear picture of what happened 100 years ago. But that's just it. The champions that Link knew 100 years ago are gone. Zelda is gone. We don't go through this adventure with anyone by our side. We have no one to latch on to and to grow with. The champion descendants found in each location play no part in the end. They are simply there and then have no relevance, with the former champions (who we have never interacted with) are shoe-horned back in. In the end the final confrontation with Ganon doesn't hold a lot of weight because we aren't fighting for people we care about. There's no one that we can latch onto, that we grew with, who we want to save. It's only Zelda (who we never spend game time with).
My other issue with the game is there seems to be missing a Zelda charm seen from other 3D entries. Not having unique, puzzle solving dungeons leaves a huge void. The four divine beasts were short and quiet generic. The bosses for each divine beast were boring as well. They were all variations of a phantom Ganon. The shrines scattered across Hyrule didn't scratch the dungeon itch either. A lot of them were very similar. Again, these elements took a back seat to exploration and the vastness of Hyrule. Story-wise it would have made sense for there to have been dungeons. Ganon had 100 years to build up his forces. There could easily have been ""dungeons"" throughout Hyrule were Link needed to defeat Ganon's generals and lieutenants.
Over-all this game is a solid Legend of Zelda title and did a lot to mix things up for the better. It's by no means perfect and suffers on the story-side. The exploration and game play are excellent and I immensely enjoyed each of the 165 hours I put into this game.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Shrines are orange glowing cave kind of things which are different inside every time. There are many over the beautiful open-world. Shrines have very fun and sometimes challenging puzzles inside which 2 Minutes to 20 minutes to complete. Every Shrine you complete gives you a point (which i forgot what there called) and when you get 4 can turn it into another health heart or turn into more stamina.

XWhiteWO1fX,22-01-2018,"Pros:
- One of the best LoZ experiences since OoT. Truly feels like an epic LoZ filled with an meaningful final battle and a silent but realatable protagonist
-Never feels boring even after multiple plays. Will keep coming back regardless of the amount of times I play this game
-Open-World aspect and combat system is perfected from the previous games and honed by Nintendo's greatest minds.
-Characters are well designed and graphics capture an uplifting but dramatic feel.
-Portability is perfected and the multiple wells to play feel like an epic well tuned adventure.
-Story is one of the best and the lore is one of the most honed in any LoT game.
-Can say with 95 percent certainly comparable to OoT!
-Starting area and ending zone are well designed.
Cons
-Lack of meaningful characters,dialogue, and actions the main protagonist performs. LoZ boasts a plot happening spoilers 100 years after evils's attack. Characters you meet(NPCs) offer virtually no backstory to the events in the kingdom and the overall timeline this is taking place. LoZ fans know three alt realities were created with the aftermath of OoT. This game doesn't offer any clear cut which is a pro but a con to the timeline established in Hyrule Historia.
-With the lack of meaningful characters come a relative lack of importance of completing the game. No point in completing a game with the big evil not moving anywhere or affecting the landcape.

Verdict
LoT is a proud addition to the series! It rivals the dominion established by OoT and TP on it's open world ecosystem! The protagonist is relatable and impactful. Characters lack true meaning to the story.

UchihaBawb,22-02-2018,"A game to get lost in. A world so deep in life and character that it has you thinking, will anything ever top this?
I'm 32, coming 33 this year and I often look back over games I've played, especially from my childhood and a few stunners crop to mind; Shadow of the Colossus (when it first released); Zelda Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask too; Final Fantasy 7 and 9 and also Half Life 2 to name a few. When thinking about these games, I tend to wonder if anything will come out that will match the enjoyment and memories those games gave me. I was probably one of a minority that do not want a Half Life 3 release because, although it would likely fit the story, will it ever live up to my expectation? My thoughts on this have changed after playing Breath of the Wild.
Now Nintendo and Valve are two very different companies, that's for sure however Nintendo have now set the bar on revisiting a title and bringing it to the new generation (see Super Mario Odyssey); with Breath of the Wild they pretty much give the player full control over how events occur and take place in the world of Hyrule, until a Blood Moon rises (more on this later).
The mechanics of the game are outstanding and made simple that your casual gamer can jump in and out of the game and boss it without the need for 20 minutes or more to ease themselves back in.
Crafting is not a big part of this game; you won't be required to make up swords, shields, armour or bows however you will have to eat. In comes the foraging aspect of the game and this is handled so well and appears like minor achievements throughout that you find yourself continually on the hunt for more ingredients or animals to make some exotic recipes to be rewarded with a happy little tune when you create a handy meal.
I've played many an open world game and one thing I could never understand as I worked my way through the game was, when returning to an area, why were the NPCs I previously killed, back again? Breath of the Wild covers this with the very clever Blood Moon. Basically, every so often, a moon powered by Ganon will rise and with it so will all of the baddies you once slain, back t seek revenge.
I'm finding it difficult to sum up how great and how much I recommend this game. I did not want it to end! I actually went around and found all the shrines and completed all the side quests before even considering riding off towards the castle (Zelda had already waited 100 years for Link to appear once more, what damage would a few more weeks do? I thought). The side quests are a joy and cover a wide range of duties e.g. helping fix a marriage on the brink due to the husbands fascination for chickens (yes, Zelda fans, they're back); playing golf with a Goron; hunting giant horses and probably my favourite which was helping Hudson build a town and then fill it with a community.
So it's been 20 years since ocarina of time and I still think about it and look back fondly and I know for sure that this game will and has left the same lasting impression. Now to download the DLC!

Go on, buy it, you won't regret it. If it makes you feel better, I had this for the Wii U before buying my Switch and therefore bought a second copy of it and started it over again. Did not regret that decision as I still feel I got more than what I paid for it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

SennaTheSenna,14-02-2018,"To get straight to the point, Breath of the Wild is probably the best game yet. Sure, it's not perfect. but good enough to give it a solid 10/10!

Zelda games have most of the time a lot of freedom, but BOTW is the true definition of an open-world game. You start of at the great plateau, where you'll learn the basics of the game, such as the combat system (which is really good in my opinion) and shrines. In the four shrines on the great plateau you'll find runes that will help you a lot in your quest. The great plateau is kind of linear, but after that the freedom is all yours. If you want you could just skip the entire story and go face the final boss right away. I recommend following the story though.

I see a lot of people complaining about the empty world. I actually don't see a problem with that. To me it looks kind of realistic and stunning to look at. The only real problem I have with this game is the lack of music. I know, it fits with the open-world theme but I want some music that I'll still remember when I'm old. Luckily this game still has some great themes, such as the mini-bosses and villages.

One thing I truly love about this game is that it has so much styles. First of all it's an open-world game of course, but it also has great combat, confusing puzzles, sexeh waifus and fun mini-games. You may not like all of them but BOTW sure is a game everyone can enjoy!

Overall, Breath of the Wild is an almost perfect game and definitely way better than that freaking 97 it has now. THE must have for the Nintendo Switch!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Theocrates,14-11-2018,"Don't get me wrong, this game is one of the best NIntendo releases out there. However, it has flaws that are overlooked heavily by reviewers.

THE WORLD: Good world design, however the textures are suprisingly poor quality. I understand the Switch has weaker hardware, but Mario Odyssey looked much better textures wise.

THE STORY: Starts slow and nearly lost my interest with the game on the Plateau. However once you leave the area, the story unfolds. I won't include details because spoilers, but the story is enthralling, especially for long-time Zelda fans.

COMBAT: Again, has issues that are being overlooked by most reviewers. Weapon combat is extremely unintuitive and slow. Easily broken weapons can get irritating, especially early in the game when most weapons are destroyed in what seems like 5 hits maximum. This could have been done a lot better.

AI: AI is impressive. Enemies of different kinds seem more or less intelligent depending on the type and challenge the player to learn their strengths and weaknesses to combat them. Well done.

DIFFICULTY: Just right

Must have for Switch owners, but don't overlook its issues just because Nintendo made it.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

DSmith349,22-02-2018,"There's a reason this game has so much positive press. It's because it's simply brilliant.
The creators of this game totally revamped how Zelda games are played. But they did so to mainly good effect. This made BOTW a refreshing take on the Zelda series (that's not to say the old format was bad and I would happily welcome a return to it in a future Zelda release, I think it's fine to have the best of both worlds).
The art style is lovely. The game world is huge, but constantly interesting to explore. And that's what BOTW probably does best, exploration. As soon as you set off in this game, you are free to go wherever you please and complete whichever dungeon you wish. This freedom is such a refreshing take in genre that has traditionally followed linear paths.
The number of weapons and armour and collectibles on this game is pretty vast too, making the game continually engaging and presenting an element of character progression without actually having a ""level-up"" system.

I found weapon breakages a bit annoying in the early game, but this was fine later in the game as you accumulate better weapons and more of them. So while it seemed annoying in the early game, upon reflection it just provided a good challenge and a level of satisfaction and relief when I came across better weapons. Overall game difficulty fits just about nice with character progression.

The only drawbacks to this game for me were that the dungeons didn't feel as ""deep"" as they have in previous games and so I found myself getting through each dungeon pretty quick. Although I accept that they did add shrines (and so many), this didn't address the lack of depth in the four dungeons, it just added more ""shallow"" dungeon-esque places (shallow seems to harsh a word but I can't think of another right now). That said, the puzzles within many of them were great.

I also felt the game lacked a proper end game after defeating the final boss.

All in all, Zelda BOTW is a masterpiece and represents an incredible launch title. The game is a must-have for any new Switch owner. It's a game that is constantly interesting and where exploration is constant. The game is also challenging, but not too difficult.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

halo124,13-11-2018,"This game is widely talked about because of it's massive open world but the story and game play i think is where this game is at its best because the map is not always that great. I am certainly not saying it is bad i think it is great but some moments force you to run and glide too far and i know there are towers which you can teleport to but even then some sections you just fall and end up killing yourself at because for some reason the game forces you to go to a section different even though you should be able to glide. Also the first 30 minutes to a 1 hour of the game is a huge grind because even though the weapons are great in the first section you only get to use less than a quarter of them and most of those ones are the ones that break easily so it makes the game tedious at times. After that though i have no problems with the game so i am going to start by complimenting its fantastic art style. The art style is fantastic by blending lots of different enemies, villages and architectural designs and some how they made it so they all fit within the same art design unlike some games like halo 4. The variety of armor is astonishing and it makes you able to turn links clothing to a girls outfit to literately wearing nothing but pants.There are 3 different sort of enemies you fight throughout the game and there are Bokoblins , lizals and an enemy which the name i can't remember that has a unique brown cream and purple design which is a lot better than what i am describing. There are small mini bosses you can fight in the game which give you decent weapons but the actual bosses are very challenging but i will not spoil it for you.

squalledu86,01-10-2020,"""THE LORD IS MY HELPER""

I can't help but give this game a Zero score. I use a thermometer of sorts to evaluate a game and the case is that while playing BOTW the thermometer ... EJACULATED! So if there is barely any fluid remaining in the thermometer I think the grade for the game is like a ... ahn ... Zero. So, a 0-10 scale is not appropriate for this game so I recommend ""100X Games"" for that. Just type ""www"" followed by a dot then ""100xgames"" followed by another dot and then the usual ""com"" of many sites.

Yeah, this is the first time I think I give Zero to a game.

I highly recommend if you play the game to play a blind playthrough rather than a walkthrough as this game is not that frustrating and there is a map usually telling you where to go (except some side quests).

While being a mystery a lot of the time, I don't recommend using a guide as the game is never too tricky or confusing. Many features of the game such as shrines and horses extend gameplay while side quests and/or shrine quests will require one of the most interesting features in the game.
On the Nintendo Switch, the controls feel perfect. I haven't played the Wii U version, though.
SPOILER ALERT! SPOILERS AHEAD!
Think about if you care about spoilers or not!

The story of the game is one of the most creative video game stories I've ever known. Basically, Calamity Ganon has devastated Hyrule and nearly killed Link, the appointed knight of Princess Zelda. He is given a century of recovery before receiving the Sheikah Slate. He travels around the world, finding interesting characters like Prince Sidon of the Zora and the Old Man, who turns out to be the deceased King Rhoam of Hyrule. Through various sources you figure out that you must appease four Divine Beasts that were on the side of the Hyrulians until Calamity Ganon turned them against Hyrule. Along with the Divine Beasts, there are also the Guardians in the same situation. Originally, the Divine Beasts and Guardians were created by the Sheikah 10,000 years ago but were uncovered by Hyrule a century ago.

This game gets a perfect 10/10 for its action-packed story and gameplay, quests, and overall experience. This game makes it hard to express the enjoyment and things that players will enjoy in an infinite amount of characters, so I won't even try with 5000.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

B-Bog,22-03-2019,"An absolute masterclass in game-design and Open-World design in particular.

This seems like a chliched phrase, but the main character in this game is not Link. It's not Zelda. It's the world of Hyrule. BREATH of the Wild is such a perfect title because this world is alive, it breathes. Everything just flows very organically. You always want to know what's around the next corner. ""Oh there's a little forest. Let's see if I can shoot some deer. Pick up some mushrooms while I'm at it. Maybe cut down some trees for firewood. Am I going to use my sword for that or an axe? Or better yet, I'll use the bombs, so I can spare my weapons! What's up with this giant tree? Is there a Korok hiding here? My Shiekah radar is beeping, there must be a shrine nearby... Maybe behind this hill? Oh **** there's a guardian! Do I run away? Try to deflect his beam? Attack him with (ancient) arrows?""

This really is an open-world game in the best sense of the expression. There are no endless text boxes explaining super-complicated controls and systems. The tutorial doesn't last 20 hours. There are no missions where you have to do EXACTLY what the game tells you to or you fail, the very opposite of what an open-world sandbox experience should be like (Looking at you, Rockstar...).

Taking the first step outside the cave where you start and having a look at the landscape is just magical. A whole world for you to explore.

After the game introduces you to the main mechanics in a fun way on The Great Plateau, you're free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want. This is the magic of BotW. Real Freedom. You can explore every nook and cranny, climb every mountain and get every upgrade imaginable. Or you can head straight to the final boss and try your luck with him with your three hearts (if you get that far). You can solve puzzles and defeat enemies in whatever way you like to. Whatever works, works. Better yet, things pretty much always work the way that you would expect them to, knowing the rules of this world.

For a common criticism: Many people seemed to expect this game to have the same kind of memorable, typical Zelda tunes that played in past Zelda games like Ocarina of Time. But just like with everything else, Nintendo took kind of a different approach here. First, you have to acknowledge that now pretty much the whole game (aside from the shrines and the Titans) is ""overworld"". So if there was a BotW Overworld-Theme, it would be playing all the time and you would probably get sick of it really quickly. Second, the ""lack"" of music really reinforces the atmosphere. Again, BREATH of The Wild. Breathing. Space. Quietness. I know a lot of people in our frenzied culture cannot stand to have even a moment of peace and quiet and need constant stimulation. But I personally really like the choice that was made here. Just simple, quiet piano or no music at all when traversing the vast stretches of Hyrule. It really helps immerse yourself in the feeling of exploring this empty, ruined land, that is paradoxically filled with life, secrets and imagination. Plus, there actually are quite a few noteable tracks in this game, like the music in Kakariko or Hateno. The former, after having been portrayed in the past as a small, lazy town and, after that, a Wild West settlement, has now been reimagined as a beautiful Japanese village.

Another common criticism is the presentation of the story or the lack thereof. Now, I think the way it was handled, through collectable flashbacks, is perfect for this game. This way, there is no story that needs to be advanced before you can get to the final boss. If you want to know the backstory, you can collect the memories. If you don't care, you don't have to, and everything in the game still makes sense. Again, everything in this game is about freedom and giving the player choice. And personally, I really liked the idea of the lost battle 100 years ago and exploring the ruined Hyrule, even if it may just have been a practical decision by the developers.

On top of all the aforementioned positives, there is the classical Nintendo/Zelda charm. The world is just filled with memorable, likeable characters. Every little NPC has a personality to them. Even though you are exploring a wild landscape by yourself (there is no companion character like Navi or Phi), you never feel alone or lonely.

Nintendo tried something new and very different for this iteration of the Zelda franchise, and it paid off BIG TIME. BotW is my favourite Zelda game and my all-time favourite video game in general. It's as close to perfect as you can possibly get. Everything is just designed and thought out so well and polished to make the experience very intuitive and the best that it can be. It's a masterpiece and a true work of art.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TheAnon88,07-09-2018,"Zelda: BotW is one of those games that can really help one re-kindle the love and passion towards video games once again in these dark times. The LoZ series has never exactly suffered of lack of quality, but its highest highs are so towering, that even ""pretty good"" results may seem pathetic in comparison at times.

Breath Of The Wild tackles two seemingly opposing tasks at once: taking the series back to its VERY roots, as in NES' Zelda 1, and providing a modern, truly open-world experience as well. Most of the fans already do know that LoZ1 was technically one of the earliest ""open world"" games, with no real guidance forcing you down to a specific path. Thus, BotW mimicking this design style is not exactly anything new, but how it goes performing this task is nothing short of unique and amazing.

After the relative short, yet already very non-patronizing ""tutorial section"", which itself has more freedom and features than some full games, the player is free to explore the now ruined world of Hyrule as they please. You get only a couple pointers that you may choose to follow at your own pace, like the ultimate goal of defeating the final evil that constantly lurks in the horizon, but ultimately BotW is all about free, self-imposed exploration, discovery, and improving yourself in order to take on even bigger challenges. Unlike in most other, modern open-world games, you're not given a pile of tasks and checklists to complete; instead, your own curiosity guides you at all times, to adventures not written down as a script. It's quite common to climb on top of a good vantage point, scan the landscape, see one or two interesting details in the environment, and start proceeding towards them ... only to get distracted mid-way by something totally different and forget what you were doing originally.

You get a handful of magical items almost right off the bat, and it's up to you to figure out when and how to use these dynamic tools during your quest. Not only that, the game seemingly lacks traditional obstacles, as just about every single wall, cliff and tree can be climbed. This vertical freedom truly opens up the world in never before seen ways, but at the same time it's balanced with the simple stamina system and the dynamic, area-specific weather conditions. You can help your character's own performance in numerous ways, such as by equipping various clothes that provide stat boosts, or by cooking dishes and potions that provide a momentary effects.

Which brings me to the next innovation and milestone of this game: its pile of intertwined systems and physics. Just about everything seems to interact with everything in a logical, albeit in exaggerated ways in BotW: grass and wooden items may catch fire, metal and water conduct electricity, trees may be chopped down and used to form bridges or make-shift boulder traps, fire-based weapons and hot food protect you from freezing blizzards and cold items from burning heat ... the list goes on. Ergo, a smart player can exploit these systems in many clever ways, tackling obstacles in innovative ways, thus saving you from the trouble of just walking and trying to smack things dead.

If you go around lurking on the internet, you may find nitpicks about most things you may discover in the Hyrule to boil down to two types of collectibles. While you indeed will get very familiar with Shrines and Seeds, make no mistake: the game has tons of other content as well. However, because the joy of exploration and discovering things yourself is such a centric part of BotW's appeal, I'd rather avoid spoiling too much of these elements. I can however say that old-time fans may locate things that will certainly tickle their nostalgic heart.

Audio-visually BotW is top-notch. The non-realistic art style helps make the game world feel more cohesive, believable even with all its magical feats. Yet it is indeed very impressive to see some of the more modern effects, such as screen-space reflections, wet-surface effects and dynamic lighting, to be used in a WiiU game. At best, the game truly looks beautiful, and the atmospheric, sparingly used soundtrack only enhances the exploration.

Controls are nothing special, but I don't feel like they ever got in my way. Some of the menu designs clearly hint at the game being designed to use the touch-screen at one point, but unfortunately now you can only use the tablet for gyro-aiming (big help when using a bow!) and to toggle the image between TV and the tablet.

tl;dr: Breath Of The Wild is THE most ""open"" open-world game ever. The most dynamic and detailed open world game, ever. One of the least handholding open-world game, ever. This game's an adventure, not a story-rich fairytale you consume in one sitting.

nunakos,28-04-2018,"Breath of the wild made me feel almost the same thing that I felt when I played Ocarina of Time. The difference is that I was 15 back then and ever since I've been waiting for a game to make me feel the same. This game almost did that. It still did not make me feel the same awe, but I know I will never feel that way again. Still, BotW managed to almost get there. It is an awesome game. It has flaws. The old dungeons are missed and the story sucks. But the whole package is awesome anyway and admirable. Typical Nintendo refinement and a still present feeling that this is Zelda anyway. The only thing that one can hope is that the next Zelda will really make everything that one expects from Zelda combined with the novelty this game presented to us. But with Ganon gone once and for all and new concepts, such as the awesome motorcycle. Zelda needs to let Ganon go and create different settings and stories. This game gives the impression that Nintendo is doing just that. Like a goodbye to Ganon. I hope that is the reason why he was so easy and boring to kill. Because the other great flaw of this Zelda is the bosses. Still, with all its weaknesses, this is a game to behold in every sense. Never was there such freedom in a game. If I was a professional reviewer I think I wouldn't give it a 10 though. 9.9. Just because it is not perfect. But I reckon that it deserves a 10 anyway. Because it is literally game changing. You will get immersed in this Hyrule. I still go there every now and then after almost 200 hours of gameplay. I was never a completionist. When the story is done it is done.

madsmmlaursen,16-12-2019,Breath of the wild / BOTW is a fantastic game i have around 220 hours in the game i have every region beat the game on master mode and i have all the DLC and through all that there was not one moment were i was bored this is probably my favorite game of all time the combat is so creative you can approach a fight in any way you want to. The world of the game is simply amazing its probably one of the biggest openworlds i have ever played it's around 60% bigger than Skyrim . The only thing that i don't like is the ending of the game the final boss is really easy even in master mode but that's the point of BOTW it's all about the journey not the destination. Many people complain about the weapons breaking but i personally really like the feature it all ways makes me improvise and not just rush into battle with my strongest weapon or bow. Overall BOTW is an amazing openworld game with so much content you can play for hours,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
bersi84,03-10-2020,"The game for me is kind of 8.5 with tendency towards 9.0. In my opinion the game lacks a bit of graphical detail, the world feels vast but very empty. The beasts and temples are cleverly designed but repetitive nontheless which didnt carry my motivation towards the whole main story line. And although I understand that durability on items can help to uncover new weapons you would usually never use I feel this is not the best way to do it. Having unique weapons destroyed in a few hits feels unbalanced and I like having bonds to my equipment.

The boss monsters feel very ambivalent too. Although they are wholeheartedly designed the attack patterns are weak and very unspectacular. The radar is a nice addition but sometimes confused me more than it helped. I agree with opinions that you always uncover something new when you let your eyes strive through the world. This is something they designed very well and I appreciated that. It felt a little bit awkward that the game got so much praise when some of its basics use the very same game loop then your very hated Ubisoft open world game loop, best example are the towers to reveal the local area. They put some mechanical candy onto each tower but still that felt like a huge wtf-moment for me.

The weather and day/night-system was impressive to me. I hated that I had to cope with it but it felt like a cool addition and brought also some mechnical detail into the game. Overall the game is nice, it felt a little bit unnecessary long at times and the basic loops have the same negative impact then any other open world game to me. Despite what many people think (or maybe just tell themselves) I personally really hope that some day we get a more realistic Zelda on a game engine like UE5. Many people will hate me for this comment but I m sure the game will be even greater with a little bit more detail because the passion of the developers is obviously great but they are hindered by what the console can provide.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

El juego tiene la mayor sensación de libertad que yo haya experimentado dentro de un videojuego montañas, arboles y estructuras (salvo algunas las cuales tienen un material el cual a simple vista uno dice ""eso no se puede escalar) todo eso se puede escalara y abordar los objetivos de diversas formas sumando las habilidades que te da la tableta sheika y las conseguidas en las 4 bestias divinas estas formas de abordar un objetivo se transforman en una experiencia inolvidable y es una excusa mas para fomentar la rejugabilidad en este juego, el juego tiene una gran cantidad de enemigos, armas, anímales, etc. La variedad de biomas y detalles de esto potencia el realismo del juego no puedes ir al decierto con la ropa que fuiste las diversas montañas nevadas del juego y viceversa la comida es muy importante en el juego y no es algo que te parezca aburrido por mi parte me parecio algo entretenido ver las diversas atrocidades que e creado por juntar comida que no tiene ni pies ni cabeza al cocinarlas juntas y ver las delicias que parecen echas por Gordon Ramsay. Los personajes son muy memorables desde Pay hasta Sidon todos los personajes con algo de relevancia en la historia (y algunos que no la tienen) tiene una personalidad que terminara por hacerte recordar estos personajes por mucho tiempo. Y lo mas impactante segun mi criterio es la nostalgia al ver escenarios y objetos, volver a ver el rancho lon-lon destruido ,ver al gran árbol deku (o el retoño que dejo en ocarina of time la verdad la cronologia de la historia no esta definida y tu la tienes que ubicar según tu criterio, otro punto a favor) y la majestuosidad de la espada maestra la cual es algo indispensable en la saga zelda por eso y muchos momentos mas el juego vale totalmente la pena. Se me olvidaba mencionar la luna roja o luna de sangre una explicación para el respawn de los enemigos el cual pocos juegos se centran en este pequeño pero gran detalle.(seguramente se me olvida uno que otro punto a favor pero los que mencione creo que son los principales).
Los puntos negativos y varios de estos no tienen perdón para empezar la falta de música la cual es reemplazada pro el sonido ambiente esto es algo mas subjetivo pero una que otra pequeña melodia durante un largo viaje no molesta, el mundo por un lado lleno y por el otro vació solo santuarios
, las 4 bestias divinas y las torres son lo principal del mapa y sino mal recuerdo hay 2 o 3 jefes opcionales los cuales se repiten en el mapa. Un insulto que se consiga a Epona mediante un amiibo le quitan un gran rasgo a la saga. Que pongan a Ganondorf como una bestia como algo parecida a los juegos anteriores no me pareció una idea del todo correcta esperaba algo superior a la aparición de este en twilight princess la cual me parece su mejor aparición con ocarina of time y la mejo batalla contra este con auna canción epica y momentos inolvidables sin embargo en breath of the wild no cumplio mis expectativas y en si la trama del juego y su mundo mas las posibilidades que te da la jugabilidad pudo tener la mejor aparición en un zelda.

Y es que ese no es el èstilo de TLOZ, si bien la naturaleza engañosa del universo de la franquicìa pedìa que se le diera su propio mundo abierto, lo que hacìa TLOZ un franquicia de exito, era su mitologìa, historìa y sus personajes, y aquì se deja todo eso en segundo plano.

HalJSmokes,19-06-2018,"A fantastic and almost perfect entry in the Zelda franchise, Breath of the Wild deserves all the hype it has received. Link is dropped into a destroyed and somber Hyrule, and left to figure out what he has to do, and how he is able to accomplish it.
Everything you see can be used to your advantage. Almost anything can be used as a weapon, and because weapons break, the player will have to use everything they are given. The player will have to become proficient with all the runes, all types of weapons (bows, spears, clubs, etc), and advantages such as stealth and speed if the player wants to survive. You can't just find one nice weapon and grind the game away. That is what makes this game exciting - being forced to know your surroundings and the world in general. Found yourself in a desert? I bet ice would help cool down those fiery enemies. A bunch of lizalfos swimming in a pond you have to cross? I think electricity is fairly conducive to water. It's not just having to use different weapons, it's also figuring out what would be more effective in a particular circumstance. Variety is necessary.
The world is huge. The world is diverse. And the world is magical. There are so many shrines to discover. There are dragons to hunt, mushrooms to pick, fairies to find, and deserted towns and castles to explore. This is Hyrule, but it isn't the same Hyrule that has been trotted out time and time again. The Lost Woods feels new, as does Death Mountain and Gerudo Desert. A lot of this has to do with redesign and a newer atmosphere. But a lot of it has to do with the open world design. If the player is exploring the Lost Woods it is only because the player wants to explore the Lost Woods. The player can go where ever they want, so exploration is more rewarding and new because of that. The exploration is also exciting due to the nature of Hyrule. Again this is a defeated Hyrule, a Hyrule that has seen a lot of war and destruction. The player isn't quite sure how this happened. So when the player goes through a small village or farm that has been laid to waste and taken over by moss and vines, the player is automatically going to think of a scenario for how this village was put down. The lack of exact knowledge combined with the vast amount of time Link has skipped forces the player to imagine possible outcomes and scenarios. The player will make up their own ideas for history and lore when left out of the loop. And this is a great way to add atmosphere to exploration.
That said, the story is a bit lacking however. There are four main dungeons that the player is encouraged to complete. Completing these dungeons gives the player cut scenes from Link's past. There are also lost memories that you can come across that fill in the story even further. However these memories are mainly just cut scenes between Link and Zelda, and don't develop the history of how Hyrule collapsed as it did. There is a brief overview/cut scene that explains the fall of Hyrule, but it is so basic and quick compared to the devastated world the player sees in front of them, that it falls fairly flat. Having more of a story might make exploration less exciting. If you love Zelda lore, this isn't really the game for that.
This game is amazing and worth every penny and minute spent on it. I would prefer a more detailed story and maybe a bit more variation in the types of enemies in the game. But other than that, this video game is as close to perfection as possible.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Justjoined83,09-12-2019,"*Long review*

Breath of the Wild is a breath of fresh air for the Legend of Zelda series. From the moment Link departs the shrine of resurrection and steps onto the vast plains of Hyrule, it becomes immediately clear just how many things there are to see and do in this world.

Let’s start with the most visible things first, the Towers. Sheikah Towers have been erected throughout the land that act as vantage points for Link to assess his current location. By climbing these towers, Link can scan his Sheikah slate into the tower’s central computer to open the regional map and plan the safest route of travel over the horizon. Combined with the paraglider, Link can mark a beacon on his map, jump from these towers and glide a fair distance towards his target. This is the best implementation of travel in a modern Zelda yet and for that reason it would not be a stretch to say the paraglider is the most useful item in the entire series.

Speaking of the paraglider, it is needed early in Link’s adventure since he does not have the stamina to reach the lower levels of Hyrule by climbing down. To complete this objective, Link must undergo a trial given to him by the old man in the demo. This is as close as the game comes to linearity and it all happens within the opening minutes of the game. Breath of the wild simply gives you the essential tools upfront and everything thereafter is up to you.

If Breath of the Wild has a weak point it would have to be the design of the dungeons. The dungeons this time around take place on the backs of divine beasts which were originally created to defend Hyrule but have fallen into Ganon’s control. These dungeons offer clever puzzles and boss fights that compliment their environments, but the interior walls of the dungeons all look the same. Still, it is a breath taking sight to be riding these beasts and looking out over the horizon.

The game also features a series of mini-dungeons called shrines that double as warp points when you open them. These shrines range from tiny to medium in size and can be found scattered throughout the land, usually a fair distance apart from one another. Most shrines contain puzzles with treasure chests, but some shrines offer free treasure or a boss fight. Each shrine completed nets you a spirit orb which can be used to upgrade your hearts or stamina. These challenges are both enjoyable and necessary since weapons in your inventory will frequently break.

In addition to shrines and towers, the game features a plethora of towns and horse stables in each region. These towns are home to some pretty interesting characters and the stables are a great place to refresh your hearts or to get helpful tips about the local region. I spent well over 300 hours trying to complete every side quest in Breath of the Wild but ultimately fell short of the required 900 Korok seeds needed to 100% the game.

So with all that being said, Breath of the Wild is an easy 10 out of 10 and a worthy recipient for 2017 game of the year. What it lacks in dungeon design it makes up for with fresh gameplay mechanics in a living breathing world that feels more alive than it’s predecessors. Is it my favourite Zelda game? That’s hard to say. My tastes are constantly evolving but what I can say is that Breath of the Wild lived up to my expectations and I cannot wait to play the next instalment in this franchise.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Paradox_,12-09-2019,"maravilloso!!, excepcional, una obra de arte, me encanto el simbolismo de la aventura reflejada en este juego, la incertidumbre por explorar y pasar el juego como tu quieras es increíble, un juego de maravilla que debes tener en switch si o si",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Sunshadow87,14-12-2020,"Una obra maestra que quizás no sea para todo el mundo, pero que transmite una experiencia como ningún otro actual.
Este Zelda rompe bastante con otros Zeldas, especialmente con los actuales, pero en gran parte es así por que el juego vuelve en gran medida a sus raíces, a aquel primer Zelda en vista de pájaro de la NES, pero en 3D y a una escala mucho mayor.
Hay varios puntos que debo aclarar ya que son algunos de los mejores puntos del juego y se han criticado de manera absurda por muchos:
- La historia: es seguramente una de las mejores historias de cualquier Zelda, y de cualquier juego actual. Puedes pasar de la historia e ir a por Ganon, o pasearte por el mundo ignorando todo lo que te rodea, e evidentemente no te enteraras de nada, ni descubrirás porque el mundo esta ahí... pero ignorar la ambientación de este juego, la cual es brutal, es un pecado en sí mismo. Voy a spoilear un poco sin dar muchos detalles, pero, la historia del cataclismo viene dada por un problema muy común para muchos adolescentes y con el que muchos se verán identificados: la presión de las expectativas puestas encima de los hijos por los padres (y llevado de una manera magistral). No hay cinematicas... busca los recuerdos, lee los diarios de Mypha, Zelda o el diario oculto del rey Rhoam... y suelta alguna lagrimita hilando todo.
- La ambientación y el mundo: otra crítica absurda es que el mundo esta vacío... más bien todo lo contrario. El mundo es enorme y lleno de vida. No de vida humana obviamente, el mundo esta devastado, y las poblaciones y viajeros son pocos y escasos. Pero la sensación de caminar por los diferentes paisajes y biomas es muy similar a hacerlo en la realidad (no se, parece que algunos deberían salir más a la naturaleza para entender que en la vida real no hay 2 manadas de lobos, un castillo y 8 elefantes rosas bailarines detrás de cada colina). Dicho esto, el mundo esta lleno de detalles y acertijos ocultos por doquier. La música es brutal también, igual que el arte.
- Las físicas: este punto creo que no hay mucho que decir que no se haya dicho ya. Simplemente increíble todo lo que han tenido en cuenta para esto.
- El resto: jugabilidad, gráficos, IA, etc... son también muy buenos (si hay bajadas de frames en el bosque kolog... au). Los únicos aspectos negativos, que en realidad son relativos y afectan más a los fans de la saga, es la desaparición de las mecánicas de ir obteniendo nuevos ítems y armas a lo largo del juego para acceder a nuevas áreas, lo cual quita la emoción del descubrimiento de estos mismos y el revisitar sitios (aparte de por la dificultad).",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Dperks,12-07-2021,There's a lot to love about this game from the visuals to the wonderful music and sound effects and the true open world sense you get that you can go anywhere at any time if you want. Point is there's so much I do love about this game but I'd be remiss if I didn't mention some of the things that I didn't like. For starters and this is more of a personal thing but the game is really big. What I mean is that the game can feel really overwhelming with how many places you can go and with how many of those korak seeds there are all over the place. I like to try to do everything in a game when I play and this game I just couldn't because of how many there are. For example there's a lot of side quests that I didn't finish and it's not just because there's so many of them. But many of them were just not that interesting or rewarding enough for me to really want to finish. Another thing that I wasn't a fan of was how repetitive the shrines could be at times. Mostly in the visuals department because they all have the same look and I get why that is but a little more variety in how they look would have been nice. And I get that it's kind of just a Zelda thing to not have a lot of voiced dialogue and I can except that for the older titles but in the future I would like to see more voiced dialogue from NPCs but I guess that's just cause I did like a lot of the characters and would like to hear more from them. One thing I thought I wouldn't like but ended up enjoying was the weapon derogation system. As it made the early game more challenging and really if non of the weapons broke the game would be way to easy. Difficulty is something the game does well in the beginning but due to the open world nature of the game it's kinda hard to gage a players skill if they can go anywhere so the level of difficulty is kinda all over the place until the end game where everything just becomes real easy. Again I really enjoyed the game I think it's a great game and something that most people should give a try if they have a switch. I just wish some of the fat could be trimmed off the game to make it a bit more concise. Granted this game is no where near the same level of repetitive slog as an Ubisoft open world game tens to be so there's that at least.,9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
tonorr,26-07-2019,"Escribo esto más de un año después de haberme acabado el juego, al que le metí unas 205 horas (lo que pone en mi perfil de switch), y ojalá me hubiese durado más, ya que este juego no quería acabarlo nunca.

Es un cambio que necesitaba la saga, distinto al fin. El juego se centra 100% en la exploración, la particularidad del mismo, además de dejarte toda la libertad que quieras, es que todas las misiones que haces, todo lo que haces es por tu propio interés, porque tú quieres ir a vez que hay encima de una montaña, o porque ves un desierto y decides visitarlo etc. Otra cosa muy importante es la atención al detalle del juego, cómo interactúa link con todo lo que ve y cómo afecta el entorno al mismo link.

A 1000 cosas buenas que puedo decir del juego, así que mejor digo las malas. La duración de las armas me pareció insuficiente, además de que opino de que cierta arma y escudo deberían ser irromplibles. Los templos tochos no están a la altura, llegan a estarlo y ya me explotaría la cabeza (hay muchos santuarios, se entiende que no sean tan tochos, no lo digo como algo malo sino como algo que lo haría mejor aun).

Y bueno hay mas cosillas por ahí que yo habría puesto de otra forma, pero entre que ha pasado tiempo y no me acuerdo y que tampoco voy a decir todas las cosas buenas pues lo dejo aquí.
Le he puesto un 10 así que comprenderéis que esas cosas malas no quitan que el juego sea una obra maestra y sin duda de los mejores juegos que he jugado en mi vida.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
michaelb1928,21-04-2020,"Great Game, The World is designed beautifully. There is a real sense of discovery and the divine beats for the most part are a blast to play. The shrines are very hit or miss with honestly a majority of them forgettable. The Shrines that require the gyro controls are a nightmare. Theres a missed opportunity i think here aswell for an amazing story with fleshed out characters but they decided to play it safe with a very basic plot. The combat can get a bit repetitive as there isn't much enemy variety. The sidequest are terrible aswell with no incentive to do any of them as the rewards are never worth it. Not a massive fan of crafting in video games so the cooking mechanic didnt stand out to me. Overall a good game with some flaws.Hopefully the sequel will improve on all aspects of this and we can get a more realised vision of what this game can be",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Robjapan,29-04-2019,"Ultimately disappointing, there is so much room for a greater game that it takes away from the overall game. In other open world games like WoW or Skyrim for example, yes there are vasts areas of nothing, but they also have grand cities, towns, villages and outposts. All with different layouts, people and quests. In BoTW the cities are rather small and have a dozen of people in them, most don't offer any interactivity. The stables are copy and pasted around the world.
The shrines are also repetitive and dull. Why give us 100s of shrines with a puzzle or a single enemy in it, when we could have had just two or three shrines in each zone that had multiple puzzles and enemies to defeat?
The dungeons themselves were largely empty, shallow and small.
The ability to eat during combat is something that struck me as so stupid, in the middle of a battle are you going to just sit down and eat a bowl of hot soup?? A health potion which required 2-3 seconds to drink would have been a much better solution, instead of having endless things to cook and 90% of them being pointless and uninteresting. Having certain foods which give boosts or bonuses and leaving health to potions would improve this game a lot.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Ksamill,02-09-2018,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild is undoubtedly one of my best gaming experiences of the last years. But - from the beginning.

Link wakes up after a hundred years since Hyrule's Kingdom fall. Without memories, naked we are thrown into a huge world of goblins, trolls, centaurs and automatic soldiers. From this moment player is basically allowed to do whatever he wants. After a moment of exploring unfortunately we realize that the place we are at is only a tutorial level which is also pretty huge and full of interesting stuff. We can end a tutorial by doing a quests from an old man who later on... Okay, there is no point in talking about story cause it's not what Zelda is about, okay? It's about...

EXPLORING
First things first, Hyrule Kingdom is HUGE, okay ? I mean REALLY HUGE. And here is where Zelda shows other games what ""open world means"". Some developers mistake open world concept with just open spaces. No, that's not it. Open World means freedom. You can go everywhere in Zelda. And there always IS something everywhere. Shrines, Stables with sidequests, monsters bases and other stuff. Even climbing mountains itself is amazingly fun as it's about strategy of climbing based on stamina and not holding a knob, And that's exactly what's the best about Zelda. You NEVER get bored. I mean, really. You have nothing to do in location You are at? Go to another one, climb the tower, find some shrines, complete them, increase your stamina/hearts number, clear some monster spots, look for items to improve Your armor. There is never nothing to do.

SHRINES
This is probably this outstanding part of game. Every each one of them is completely different from one another and there is 120 of them all over the map. This is just amazing.

PLOT
As I already said - plot isn't what You buy Zelda for. Although what I previously said is true Plot is also what keeps You going. Kingdom fell 10 decades ago, everything changed but when You randomly walk and explore this living it's life world and remind yourself of Princess Zelda waiting for You to save her and the whole Hyrule it just gives You chills and a feeling of responsibility of a chosen one especially when You meet these all people counting on You.

SIDE QUESTS
The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is NOT a perfect game. There is no such a thing. Perfect example of it are side quests in this game. I have never seen such a bag of **** ""bring me 10 of these"" or ""kill 5 of those"". Fortunately those can be forgiven thanks to things that I previously talked about.

I didnt talk about many things here - variety of armors, fighting mechanics (which are awesome - You have variety of weapon kinds, items and runes that give You ability to move things, create bomb...

I’ve been a Zelda fan for literally as long as I can remember and I’ve played all the Zelda games. I can tell you first hand that this isn’t just a great game, it’s a great Zelda game. Sure, it has some problems like the dungeons not being dungeons and the weapon breaking mechanic being annoying at times but these things are something that I can easily look past knowing that this is Nintendo’s first true open world Zelda experience. Some people are not willing to accept the fact that this series is evolving, and the formula is changing. And to be honest, it’s about time. I’ve been playing this game for more than two years now with 150+ hours and I can say wholeheartedly that this game is a true masterpiece and I’m so grateful for Nintendo’s willingness to make such a life changing experience.

The camel mechanical beast and the elephant mechanical beast are ingeniously designed.

Surprisingly ugly environments, from an aesthetical point of wiew.
Character design is ugly, or occasionally awful (such as the gerudos)
Shrines offer, mostly, very simple and boring puzzles in rooms that all look the same.
The fact that you practically can eat an infinite amount of food during hectic battles is stupid game design and, more over, it removes most, if not all, of the challenge.
A lot of fetch quests that you couldn't care less about (WTF, fetch quests in a Zelda game)

Stonewallish,22-10-2018,"Zelda BOTW is a magical game. It expects a certain level of intelligence from its players and does little in the way of hand holding. The world and its beautiful physics are completely at your disposal to use and abuse; its a true sandbox open world game that stimulates players imagination without ever forcing certain situations to play out in a set way, and this is so, so rare nowadays.

The game is packed with dozens of well crafted puzzles, including the main ones which are extremely well thought out and crafted. It doesn’t matter that it offers a weak storyline and a truly annoying weapon breaking mechanic. Nearly every issue pales when confronted with the big, colorful and majestic world the player will be exploring. And how beautiful it is to explore in this game. There’s an immense sense of satisfaction in doing so, and the beautiful ambient sounds create almost a private setting between the game and the player, creating a beautiful sense of immersion and wonder.

This game has been praised as being an absolute masterpiece, and in all honesty, I fully disagree. There are many things that could have been done differently and better, starting with the infamous weapon breaking mechanic (and all the annoyances that it brings with it). Despite that, there is a weird sense of magic you can feel while playing BOTW. A sense of magic that nowadays, is very hard -if not impossible- to find elsewhere. It’s not a perfect game, by any means, but it is, indeed, a perfect experience.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
LightCreed,23-10-2018,"When I thought I wanted a new Zelda game, I never knew how beautiful this game was, the attention to detail is on point, this game pushes not only reality but it pushed a lot on how we saw hyrule today. The story is simple ganon took over hyrule and it's up to link to defeat him however this time Link has amnesia and he has to re-remember the past century events and how it was executed was ground-breaking. I had doubts when there was voice acting in this game but after looking at couple of cutscenes I knew the actors deserved praise. The game was challenging and I enjoyed that challenge. And the fight against calamity was epic. however the flaw this game has is the fact that the ending wasn't fully developed but other then that. breath of the wild is a must have on the nintendo switch and while i didn't like the ending it as a whole is a standalone amazing game.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Llegó en 2017, y tuvieron que pasar dos años hasta que pudiera tenerlo entre mis manos, y debo decir, totalmente orgulloso, que la espera ha valido cada sufrido segundo que desee poder jugar esta obra maestra.

No les voy a contar nada que no hayan leído u oído en este tiempo, y tampoco van a leer un análisis, pues vengo con el objetivo de contar mi experiencia y opinión. Si le sirve a alguien, estaré feliz, pero la verdad, solo quiero contarlo por que, la experiencia que viví con The Legend Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild, merece que le dedique unas palabras. Bien, aquí vamos.

Desde el momento uno que me senté, conecté la consola y empecé a ver las primeras imágenes del juego, me invadió una emoción casi desbordante. No sabía si sonreír o llorar, pues, veía tan lejana la posibilidad de algún día tener la Switch, y mucho menos, poder jugar TLOZ BOTW, que no podía creer que el juego que más he anhelado en mi vida, estuviera frente a mí.

Todos saben que a nivel gráfico, sonoro y de jugabilidad, es sumamente notable (No digo perfecto, por que aunque para mi lo sea, la perfección no existe, y eso lo comprendo), pero me veo en la obligación de, por más que se haya dicho, decirlo yo también. Es una maravilla en todos los apartados.

Cada hora que pasaba, disfrutaba más. El mundo estaba vivo, y yo formaba parte de él. Quería recorrer cada rincón. Ir a pié para no perderme ningún centímetro del basto Hyrule. Todo para mi era maravilloso. Mi corazón palpitaba más y más con cada minuto que jugaba.

animal_ethics,10-12-2018,"Es un videojuego fundamental para cualquier persona que ame este mundo. Es cierto que la oración anterior no es más que retórica y podría decirse de cualquier otra obra, pero tal afirmación se reafirma en hechos. Veámoslo.
i) Es un reinventarse, coger una saga histórica, darle la vuelta y ofrecer algo nuevo. Es difícil, muchas veces, que este movimiento salga bien, pero Zelda BOW lo consigue y con creces. Quien podría imaginarse que esta saga podría acabar siendo el exponente central del género ""mundo abierto"" (siendo generalistas y asumiendo que tal cosa es un género de por sí). Y es que la apertura no es de pega, no es un mero velo, es el alma y la esencia del juego. Apertura de espacio y de posibilidades. Entendamos la historia, los santuarios, las hadas, las mazmorras etc. como un ir de x a y. No hay un mero decidir en ir de (x a y) (ir hacia un santuario, por ejemplo) o de (x a y´) (ir hacia una mazmorra, por ejemplo), si no que dentro del camino ""a"" o del camino ""b"", hay a su vez una apertura tal que para realizar (""x a y"" o ""x a y´"") se establecen a su vez caminos secundarios que me dan la posibilidad de resolver el camino por medios infinitamente diversos y con resultados también distintos. Y aún dentro del objetivo (entendiendo ""y"" como aquello a lo que se quiere llegar) la resolución del conflicto interno se puede hacer de maneras dispares y complejas. Imaginación, destreza, habilidad, experiencia. Para concluir este punto, hay un verdadero mundo abierto, y no un simple decidir caminos.
ii) Es muy rico en matices y lleno de textos que se van entrelazando. Los habitantes de Hyrule parecen tener vida, se refugian de la lluvia, se calientan en hogueras, descansan, comercian y un largo etc. todos tienen sus preocupaciones y problemas lo que enriquece y es un buen modo de asignar las tareas secundarias. Amplitud de misterios, de tesoros, de santuarios. Es un juego ingente y completarlo en su ""todo"" es una tarea para pocos. Jugable, compartible, sorprendente en cada rincón del mapa, cuasi infinito. En definitiva, un juego para aquel que guste de sorprenderse con las cosas, que guste de tratar con lo ente por el mero tratar, y también para aquellos que gusten de sorprenderse con los misterios, los detalles, los juegos de puzles.
iii) La historia es buena y se enlaza con lo anterior. El tejido central se mezcla con lo anterior dicho y convirtiendo al juego en una pura máquina de experiencias. El problema de esto es que a veces parece no haber un objetivo final como tal, acentuado con el hecho de que ""nunca"" se resuelve el problema con Ganon. Esto último tampoco es mayor inconveniente (al menos para mi) pues todo se soluciona, insisto, aceptando que es un juego para quien quiera tratar con las cosas sin necesidad de establecer universales ni valores más allá de todo lo que ofrece para hacer con y para el mundo que se genera al rededor nuestro. El castillo es un elemento más, pero que elemento, del punto ii. Casi es más, el castillo, por sus propios secretos que por acabar con Ganon. Y es un buen enfoque. Romper con la idea del inicio-final y hacer del juego un eterno retornar a él. Yo, a día 10/12/2018, sigo aún volviendo y jugando. Perdiéndome en su inmenso mapa y a veces solo con ese fin, con el de perderme.
iv) No tiene el 10 por mi parte. ¿Por qué si he dicho tales cosas? Porque las mazmorras, pecando quizá de la apertura de posibilidades, se hacen menos ricas que en anteriores entregas de la saga, pienso por ejemplo en el Ocarina. Pero es un punto que no desmerece todo lo anterior. Este es para mí el camino a seguir y el modo de replantear una saga. Rompiendo de nuevo otro mito y es el de que lo bien hecho no debe mancharse ni tocarse. A veces hay que destruir las cosas y recomenzar para dar un salto exponencial. En este caso tal salto, tal ponerse en el filo de la navaja, ha dado resultado.
v) P.D: Es un juego para todos y para nadie. Y esto último es lo que hace que exista tanta controversia a su alrededor. Todo el mundo puede jugar a él, con él, pero no todo el mundo caerá enredado en su vasta multiplicidad. Ser consciente de todo lo que supone permite disfrutarlo en todas sus dimensiones. Pero no a todos acaba gustando su ritmo o esencia, y es legítimo. Aún así, y sobre todo los fans de la saga, encandilará a la mayoría.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

KingCritic,31-12-2018,"Easily one of the greatest games of all time. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild delivers a satisfyingly beautiful presentation on scale, world building, story, gameplay, and design. Most of my gripes are buggy graphics and such that have more to do with the Switch's shortcomings as opposed to the games'. And even gripes that are the game's fault are done purposefully to make the game better. If you play this game you will certainly not be disappointed.

That was the short version, long version of why this game is awesome along with a plot synopsis will continue now.

Synopsis: A century before the game begins, the peaceful kingdom of Hyrule was attacked by an evil entity known as Calamity Ganon, who is the game's version of the usual Zelda villain Ganondorf. Princess Zelda and her knight Link, fight the evil Ganon but lose, and Link barely escapes with his life. He's placed in a bed of water inside a cave for a hundred years and when he wakes up with no memory of what happens, he has to fight to defeat Calamity Ganon and his minions to purge Hyrule of its darkness.

Okay so first the plot. I'm not too familiar with the canon storyline of Zelda, but from what I've heard the game's storyline is completely original, at least in its structure. I really like how it got the elements of Zelda's story and broke them up into little parts and built up in its own unique way.

And surprisingly enough for such a simplistic children's story of good versus evil, it's very compelling. Link's memories become somewhat of a mystery and how he is in a world he has to defend but not remember becomes very interesting. Sure the whole ""You don't remember me but you should"" angle from almost every NPC becomes pretty flat, but I'll admit that its very compelling.

What limits the stories RPG elements such as the bog standard story and robotic NPCs are pretty much forgotten. I mean, the game is just genius. The music is atmospheric and engaging, what should make the game boring and forgettable such as the conventions of video game RPGs and fantasy instead make the game more classic. The combat sticks to the average shift and strike sort of method

but still remains very very fun. There were times when I was on the edge of my seat, just slamming the respawn button to get back at an enemy who defeated me.

Speaking of which, this game does not treat you like a baby. It doesn't hold your hand through a two hour tutorial, the handling of mechanics is very straightforward, and most of all the difficulty. On a scale between a Disney Channel online game and Dark Souls, Breath of the Wild is somewhere in the middle. It's easy enough that you can progress without being a hard core gamer, but hard enough

to want you to keep getting stronger.

Likewise, there's something here for everyone. Hard core RPG fans can enjoy the rich worldbuilding and character design. Fantasy nuts can really enjoy the brilliantly created setting. And people who like fighting games can enjoy the very fun combat angle which is a very refined system which is based both on the player's skill and items. Everyday people who aren't too into gaming and just want to escape for a little can enjoy how investing the gorgeous graphics of the game are.

My gripes actually have reasons for them existing. I really don't like how weapons can break because its annoying to get a really cool or powerful weapon just for it to break to seconds later. However it prevents players from creating an OP build and flying through the game. I also don't like how the loading screen had awkwardly scratchy transitions and how riding at full gallop on a horse can make the bottom part of the screen sort of have an annoying 'ghost effect'. Again, this is the Switch's fault, not the game's.

Another gripe I have is the reliance on more powerful weapons as opposed to skill. To defeat stronger bosses you just need better arrows, which can be bought with the game's currency rupees. But this is just pretty tedious, grinding away at weaker enemies and selling their drops to exchange them for arrows.

Again this can be blamed on the simple fact that the game is an RPG, grinding is a simple facet of every role playing game. But it also limits the game heavily, you kill monsters to get drops, you sell drops to get rupees and spend rupees to buy arrows which defeat stronger enemies. You spend rupees on arrows pretty much. While limiting, I prefer this to simply having a purely skill based system which obligates newer players to just give up instead of grind when they reach an area of the game with too strong a boss.

I've never wanted to play a game that I hoped never ended except for this one. And when I finish it, I will probably play it again and again. And if you try it, you probably will too.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ReviewerT,15-03-2019,"A game that just about every gamer should have on their shelf. Very few flaws and the ones that do exist aren't really that bad.

The game has an insanely huge world with many things to do. It's a bit daunting at first but it's packed with more content than you may think, so it is surprisingly not really repetitive.

The concept of shrines is a great addition. It's unlike the other games in the sense that if you find a shrine you don't like then you don't have to beat it. That alone gives you even more freedom than the game already offers.

The game is good in terms of difficulty. It's on the harder side according to me and a lot of others who have played this game, but it's definitely not enough to make it so that inexperienced players straight up cannot pick up the game. I mean maybe a young child couldn't but any capable kid above 10 probably should.

The soundtrack is nice although it doesn't have any masterpiece songs in it, which is one of the few things about it you can actually complain about correctly.

Otherwise, a masterpiece that everybody should have. #1 Switch Game of All Time (as of writing this) in my opinion and I don't know if another title will come close in a while.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The runes grant you physics powers and nothing has felt more satisfying than crushing lizalfos with a bookshelf. The cutscenes are phenomenal and have never felt lacking. The DLC makes it even better with special items that even a casual gamer could recognize. But the Champions Ballad is the star of the show adding even more cutscenes, shrines, and bosses. If you are thinking of getting a Nintendo Switch get this game. This is my favorite game of all time and no doubt game of the year.

RGScompany,10-02-2019,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a pleasurable experience. It provides many hours of immersive fun and a sense of discovery that is hard to find in other games. It returns the series to its roots of discovery and exploration.
The main goal the developers kept in mind during development was to give the player a sense of childlike wonder and discovery. Eiji Aonuma, the head director, wanted players to explore and discover the world at their own pace and play it how they want to. This game appeals to everyone because of the game’s goal, which was kept in mind throughout its development. The only alienating aspect of this design is that the beginning is tough relative to the rest of the game. There is a noticeable learning curve at first, and the game doesn’t do too much to help you through it. As a result, this game can alienate people that aren’t used to playing video games, but the learning curve isn’t so unfair that it pushes players away from the game.
Open-world games launch with bugs; these bugs can either break the game or have no effect at all. Breath of the Wild is an objectively well-made game because the bugs that exist don’t prevent any mechanics from functioning. The mechanics work as intended and can be pushed to extremes. The environment has little to no visual bugs and keeps you immersed. The menus aren’t hard to navigate, and the user interface isn’t intrusive. The only major issue is that the game will occasionally drop below thirty frames-per-second in certain areas.
The game is so massive, and the mechanics have so much depth, that it’d be hard to find someone that doesn’t enjoy at least one aspect of it. This game gives a sense of freedom that not many games are able to match. The physics engine alone gives a lot more depth and variety to the game-play than one would think; it allows for creativity when handling any situation. This makes it intellectually stimulating to do simple tasks, such as traversing the world. And the game provides all the physics tools in the beginning for use throughout the entire game.
The game has quests and one hundred twenty physics-based puzzles scattered throughout the world, but the game shines best when you are immersed in its exploration and discovery. The content is the reward for exploring the world. It strikes a great balance between exploration and content because of this.
The game isn’t perfect though. The story is generic and leaves much to be desired, and much of its content is shallow. Despite these negatives though, the foundation of the game is so well-made, that it is still fun. When I go back to replay this game, I don’t play it for the story or the quests, I play it for the world and its mechanics. This game succeeds in its goal to give everyone that sense of discovery that the series was originally founded upon.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Epic-jakeyo,21-01-2021,"As a long time Zelda fan all I can say is if you enjoy frustration then this is the game for you. The game fights against you at all times and takes the fun out of everything you do. New Weapon? Yeah that will break in ten hits. New area to explore? Yeah, die. Here's an enemy to one hit you because you have no way of judging it's power. Climbing a mountain ? Here's some rain, enjoy slipping and falling to your death but if not here's some lightning to finish you off. Want to heal? Cook some meals one at a time! hot area? Cook some meals one at a time! Cold area? Cook some meals one at a time! Nintendo can release whatever they want and it's an instant 10/10, doesn't that seem strange to you ? I can guarantee if this was on Playstation it wouldn't be higher than a seven. Don't believe the hype.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
HugeyBear,21-06-2019,"The game looks gorgeous. The sounds are amazing and nostalgic, the sound when something opens or you unlock a way point through puzzle solving is highly satisfying and nostalgic. I’m not massively far into the game but I do find the climbing a bit of an issue. There are a lot of mountains and scaling them or finding a route around has put me off and made me dock the switch to try again later. I think that it’s greatest strength is it’s ability to let you get on with things and discover the game. This can also be its greatest weakness at times as you can be unsure of what to do or where to go and then feel a little underwhelmed.

So, I think it deserves a 9. I think it is a really good And think as I get more invested in it, it will only get better.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

2002,11-03-2019,"The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild is probably the best game I have ever played.
Pros:

Combat;I love what you can do with your Sheikah Slate, use stasis on a crate hit it 3 times and send it flying towards a bokoblin.Im in the middle with the weapons in this game, some are great with special abilities, others are **** vile and repulsive. When i get a new weapon that's really good i'm scared to use it because it might break in 20 **** hits. I have played Resident Evil 4 and people complain at how fast you lose bullets but weapons break way to **** quickly. It makes smart gameplay and makes you think what weapon you should use. (8/10 weapon durability never made it bad or annoying just frustrating)

Graphics; Beautiful so unique and nice, honestly character models, grass, trees ,mountains etc look so good. its not 1080p even though 900p is fine but 1080p would have been nice. (docked and it can go down to 810p at points) 9/10

Exploration/World: Volcanoes, mountains, deserts etc all look so good and there is so much to do Quests, divine beasts, shrines, koroks, memories enemy bases etc. (10/10)
Cons
Framerate: Yeah it sucks ass. A lot of the time (mainly in docked) the switch felt like it was gonna puke.
Freezes:The game freezes (who would have known?).
The Voice Acting: I hear people say ""It's okay"" but it's not it's not even okay it's bad.They pause on weird moments and should have paused on others and it's just bad. The voice actors I don't blame.
It honestly sounds like they did it in one take and had no context of what they were reading.

Overall a 10/10 this game now in 20 years will be like Ocarina Of Time now.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jsmith2334,12-03-2019,"I went into this game blind with few expectations and was completely blown away. I initially thought the great plateau (the starting/tutorial area) was the entire map and was perfectly content with the size. Boy was I wrong. The game world is MASSIVE and all the mountains and objects you see in the distance, you can go to. The music is minimal and serene, and fits the theme of the story perfectly without imposing anything. It makes the few times where the music is in the forefront even more powerful.

The game heavily rewards exploration and it seems like there's something around every corner. The content is well paced out for the first blind playthrough and rekindled a sense of wonder in me that I haven't felt in a video game since Windwaker. The physics engine allows you to do basically anything you can think of and I'm still discovering new things today. The game masterfully guides exploration without ever giving you a prompt or a quest (although there are many quests in the game), instead using visual cues and exploiting the player's curiosity to guide the gameplay naturally. There is no ""wrong"" way to play the game.

Now for the negatives. While the pacing and progression is great on the first playthrough I find it to be very easy once you've figured out the tricks and quirks of the game. I definitely recommended going in blind for the best experience. The dungeons are lacking as well and feel more like extended shrines than the dungeons in other Zelda games. Boss variety is limited as well.

Overall an amazing exploration game, easily in my top 10 all time favorites.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Lp1zarr0,23-03-2019,Juego de 10 con historia bastante buena sin duda de los mejores videojuegos creados,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
drakenvon,27-03-2019,Amazing game. Vast open world. Loved the puzzles in every shine. The graphics suits in my opinion. The most enjoyable part of this game is the exploration. I am the kind of person who loves wandering around in an open world type of a game.,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Icivindur,25-06-2020,"In times of rapid decline of video games finding such a gem as Breath of the Wild is somewhat marvelous. That said as an earnest story-driven games fan who values witty dialogues, complex characters and deep, involving and original narrative, who is often get bored by the so-called ""open world games"" I was least probable target audience for an open-world adventure game. If you'd ask me I'd say that it's very unlikely for a fan of Fallout 2, Septerra Core, Planescape: Torment, KotOR II, Metro games and The Witcher 3, who is bored by Skyrim and RDR2 to like BotW. Yet here I am, totally fascinated by it.

So what's so special about BotW? First thing you'd pay attention to is the visual design. This game in no way will overwhelm you with graphics excellence but nevertheless it has very distinguish and beautiful visual style which is almost ageless (it somewhat reminds the Prince of Persia 2008). Although beauty can attract your attention, alone it cannot make you stay. Music in the game is unobtrusive and memorable, perfectly fit to the game world which feels live and engaging. Link, without proper clothing, equipment or potions can freeze in the mountains or overheat in the desert, or even burn near volcano. Weapons can be broken (easily) and wile you are free to climb almost everywhere, you have limited stamina and will fall down during the rain. All of these add to the overall atmosphere and involve into this fictional world.

But something that really shines in the BotW is His Majesty Gameplay. This game literally adapts to the player - any player! - proposing to use almost all kinds of gaming styles and activities you can imagine. If you are hardcore player who prone to swiftness, tough battles and speedrun, you can easily find tough monsters to fight, go harass Lionels or head straight to the final boss. If you prefer unhurried exploration of an unknown big world (with very different and filled with secrets locations - from snowy mountings to sandy deserts, from tropical islands to frozen tundra), finding its secrets and diverse in-game interaction - you'll find it here. If you, like me, prefer variate meditative gameplay with explorations, fights, solving riddles, following the story, interacting with characters and using gameplay mechanics to differently approach the same situation - you would also enjoy playing BotW. This game allows you to experiment almost freely, it wouldn't restrict or punish any approach to play it.

The gameplay mechanics, so-called ""physics"" is truly marvelous here. Thing is - BotW sets some general rules of its world, very similar to real world physics laws, and within these boundaries allows you to achieve goals in whichever way you are pleased. You can fight monsters relying on your reaction and swiftness, you can drop rock on them, you can set them on fire or explode them, during a storm you can drop metallic object so the lightning will struck them, you can freeze them, avoid them or you can use stealth and steal their weapons, you can flee from them or even set wild bees on them. The same thing with riddles. I can't say that I'm very much into riddle games but shrines were my favorite part of the BotW. There are different ways to solve shrine riddles. Some of them probably weren't intended by Nintendo developers, Just think how use set of general rules of this world and you'll quickly find solution fit for your gaming style. Moreover those riddles (dungeons) are short enough to not become boring.

If you like stories, you can explore Link's past, reading diaries and recollecting Link's memories about his relationship with princess Zelda and Champions. Personally I preferred to collect memories and complete shrines in an unhurried manner, but other gamers' experience can be completely different. That's the secret - BotW is open for any type of player with any gameplay preferences. Experienced, demanding gamer such as myself is as much welcomed by the BotW as hardcore player or complete novice. You can cook here, you can upgrade armor, solve riddles, complete quests, find koroks, fight, explore, experiment. But all of those activities don't feel like separated, don't fell apart - they are expertly woven into the game world, creating complex and involving atmosphere. This game is like symphonic music, combining different instruments, harmonies and melodies into the one beautiful symphony.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Shatterfish,02-04-2019,"Zelda: Breath of the Wild is, quite possibly, one of the best games made in the last 10 years.
There really is no other way to put it.
I’ve played many Zelda games over the years, and in that time I’ve only finished 2.
The first one was Wind Waker, and the second is BOTW.
Wind Waker I played through many times, and BOTW is shaping up to be the same way seeing as how I’ve put almost 100 hours into my main file and just started Master Mode.
Perhaps coming into it late after all the FPS issues were ironed out helped, but I’ve had none of the problems so many on here complain about. In fact, after my playthoughs AND watching my wife play all the way though I’ve only see one full on crash.
Is BOTW a perfect game?
No.
It’s got its issues just like anything else. UI is a bit of a kludge but it does what it needs to.
Game is a bit light on story, but honestly it kind of fits with the memory loss/overgrown wilderness/discovery theme of the whole game.
I at least felt like I understood eveything going on, if not so much how it all came to be with some world building plot holes.
All of the negative reviews I’ve read have either started with, or included, the phrase “Zelda Fan” somewhere in it.
Speaking as a person who’s played a decent amount of Zelda, but would not call themselves a “fan”, it’s a great game. God forbid the franchise evolves past a 25 year old formula of linear dungeons and formulaic equipment unlocks.
And speaking from my wife’s perspective, who has never played a Zelda game, she absolutely adored BOTW.
Don’t let old fans who resist any amount of change try to tell you this is a bad game.
I suppose if you are REALLY into the old school Zeldas or aren’t that into open world RPGs then this game isn’t for you.
But if you’re willing to put aside preconceptions about what a Zelda game “should” be then this game is far more worthy of your time and money than just about anything out there these days.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It tries so hard to stray away from the traditional Zelda formula that it truly becomes something else. Things you know Zelda for: great music, large-scale dungeons with big bosses to defeat, an arsenal of weapons that DON'T break after a few uses. These things are lacking in this game.

The open-world letting you explore the world and go wherever you want is so amazing. The mini-bosses in the world are unexpected and rewarding after you beat them for the first time. The ''dungeons'' in this game aren't as big as in other Zelda games(at least that's what i've heard), but they are still a good puzzle with a pretty hard boss-fight at the end. I think that the ending is the single worse part in the game. Ganon could've been more than 4 blights summed all in one and he wasn't even that hard.

Beng119583,30-06-2019,"Overall a great and highly thought out game. However, it lacks some of the soul that make previous Zelda games so amazing. The size of the map is great, however there isn’t much initiative to explore as it starts to become empty and repetitive. There’s no variety in enemies or dungeons either. And some of the comedy in the game is not needed and detracts from the experience. Having said that, the art style, size of the map, and overall experience make this game a standout piece in the Zelda series and I think it is a great starting point for future games in the series to add to.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

vudgekek,01-07-2019,"Absolutely stunning and a joy to play. Probably one of the best switch games out as of right now, it completely changed the game that we know as Zelda forever. Hundreds of hours worth of content that you'll enjoy every second of (not to mention the DLC)! The open world environment lets players decide their own adventure, and the music and art style truly immerse the player in the game. And the fun doesn't stop at home, the switch allows you to bring the kingdom of Hyrule and all the Zelda characters along with you, so you don't miss a second of fun! The shrines and divine beasts are an important part of the game, as they serve a replacement to our beloved dungeons. Thank Hylia they are equally as good. One of my favorite aspects of this game is the easter eggs, for example, characters and monsters that made it in Breath of the Wild from other games in the franchise. Anyways, that just about wraps up my review of this great game, 10/10...! シ",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Skippy11,31-05-2020,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will be heralded as one of the greatest games of all time for generations. The exploration in this game has been masterfully crafted to feel like you can go anywhere, and you can. The average copy and paste empty buildings in every other open-world game are not present here. Another trick they used at Nintendo was to put interesting things in every corner of the world, so no matter where you go you are progressing throughout the game. I believe that if you make an open-world game from now on you need to include climbing. The climbing mechanic and ability to glide have completely changed everything about this game. They are probably the 2 greatest mechanics ever put in a video game, and with your sheikah slate abilities, the world is your playground. I do have 2 critiques that do drag the score down slightly though. In the game, there are 2 types of dungeons. You have your mini-dungeons that are just one little puzzle called the shrines, and then you have the divine beasts. The big problem with these is that since Breath of the Wild is so non-linear the shrines and divine beasts must be designed with the idea that the player just got off the great plateau and has poor gear this, in turn, hinders the experience because the developers are too worried to scale the difficulty based on what gear the player enters the shrine or divine beast in. But, I do understand why they would be worried to do this, Eiji Aonuma and his team did not want to scale the difficulty because there are no different difficulty options, and turning off difficulty scaling would be weird. Another gripe I have with the shrines and dungeons would be their color palette, if you look at Dragon Roost island from Windwaker, the Ancient Cistern from Skyward Sword, or the Water Temple from Ocarina of Time. All of these dungeons are colorful and unique with one mechanic that carries the dungeon. On the other hand, in Breath of the Wild all the abilities that Link needs to open these dungeons are given to him from practically the very beginning of the game, so that means they can't scale them or make them more unique for different items. Now onto the story, The problem with this game's story is that it does not even take place during the game. All cutscenes and flashbacks take place 100 years before the game started which makes it seem like the world is not changing very much around you. Also, if the world changed at all after the divine beasts, or taking down Calamity Ganon I would be okay with it because you would be fixing what went wrong 100 years ago. Other than some permanent weather changes the world feels stagnant. Also, the champions are poorly written characters because they feel tacked on, and their interactions with Link are very akward because of the voice acting.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
jiorl,23-07-2019,"I have never been a zelda fan, but this game made me one. And i suspect that it made a lot of people who never took an interest in zelda at least appreciate the series more. Due to it's openworld nature, which is a mainstream idea found in games such as GTA, and it's easy controls, this for many would be the best way to try and get into the series. Anyway, pushing that to the side, i really enjoyed this game. It was an experience. The visuals are beautiful, the story is excellent, the controls are great, the difficulty is challenging and rewarding. And there is so much more. Lots of puzzles in the form of shrines are great ways to take a break from the fighting and the travelling, while also going towards making link stronger in your quest to beat Gannon. The paraglider is fantasic, and is a joy to use. I like the weapon system as well. This is contentious, considering the weapons you pick up and find are very easy to break. But i am fine with that, because it adds a new dimension to fighting enemies, in that if your weapon breaks, it now a puzzle on how to take on the enemy. There are some drawbacks such as tedious, time consuming traveling and some fps dips, but i can accept those because this game...is a masterpiece. And the dlc has fixed the long travels. I can't wait to explore the zelda series further.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It has so much content that it will keep you going for months. Definitely a must have for the switch",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
JT0718,12-07-2019,"I want to make this clear to whoever is reading this review right now. This game is not perfect, but that’s ok because no game will ever be. What this game has accomplished is simply amazing. Nintendo finally took a shot at an open world game, with the genre being as popular as it is, and blew us away with their first go. (Spoilers from here on out)

PROS- Traveling throughout the world in Breath of the Wild (BOTW) is the most fantastic part of the game. You have so many options as you are traveling. You can surf down massive cliffs and snow mountains for a blistering way to get to places. Climb up mountains anywhere to get a good view on the landscape, plan where to go next and paraglide over their. If you want to get to an area quickly you can take a horse, or if you completed the DLC a motorcycle. If your in the desert you can use a seal to take you across it quickly. This game provides options when traveling throughout the world witch plays in part why it’s so fun to explore. The other reason this game is so enticing is their is something around every corner. Their are 4 divine beast, 120 shrines, 900 korok seeds, and many side quest and mini games. So while the world is massive their is always something to see or do. The world is most enjoyed when you take your time with the game. Both me and one of my friend got the game around the same time as each other my friend tried to collect everything in the game before beating Calamity Ganon, including all 900 korok seeds. By the end of the game he had put just about 300 hours in to it. He was completely burned out and hated the game for it. This is not the game where completing it 100% completion will be fun in a short period of time. I have had the game for about 1.5 years now and still play it because I don’t do the little at at once. I beat the game a couple months after I got it and completed all the main stuff along with it like, freed all dive beast, got the master sword, found all the memories, and beat the DLC. After I defeated Ganon I still wanted to explore the world and see what I could find. I still only have about 250 korok seeds and finally finished all the shrines but I’m till even to this day having fun exploring the world. I constantly come back and find new things. I stumbled upon a beautiful dragon for the first time and was blown away. Found full towns after beating Ganon and still have fun finding korok’s around every corner. Some of the best moments I have ever had in gaming are from stumbling into stuff naturally from this game. BOTW does this better than any game I have played yet.

Cons- It’s interesting because what this game achieves so well make the shortcomings seem like more of a misstep than it normally would be. The voice acting in many ways is just average, which really surprised me since this is the first time there are voice actors in a Zelda game that both Nintendo and the voice actors didn’t go for perfection. In many of the cutscene it seemed like they were took only a couple times. The Divine Beast are very interesting and unique concept the first couple you do but later on I realized they were extremely short and boring compared to past Zelda dungeons. They also have exactly the same boring interior look for each dungeon and shrine. Again, previous Zelda dungeons where much more creative and interesting than these and if one thing gets changed in the sequel I hope it would be this. Most of the other problem I had were small. The music in this game is perfect for what the game is supposed to be, but for a more personal problem I miss the bombastic Hyrule Field music or the optimistic Great Sea theme. Again this is not a problem for the game but a personal one. The durability system is almost great for the ability to keep you on your toes at all times but I would like if you got a couple more hits out of each weapon, so instead that would make players be more aggressive instead of being cautious about breaking weapons. The menu system works ok but I still often find myself stumbling around in it. Also I didn’t like how you can only hold 5 items at a time; I would like to be able to hold more.

In conclusion, this game is fantastic and I would recommend it to anyone who has any interest in it. This is probably my favorite game of all time, mainly because I have had so many memorable moments from it and I can call my adventures in the game my own. This game got me back into video games and I really appreciate it for that. Yes, the game does have flaws just like every other game ever will, but here hoping the recently announced direct sequel can fix some of those problem, retain what’s great about this game, and come up with creative ideas and story to make it unique from its predecessor.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The world is not empty it’s full of stuff like Koroks, shrines, and animals to take pictures of, and hunt.

AngrySir,04-10-2022,"The game is very good, it takes openworld design to another level, I really like freedom to explore every inch of the map, hunt secrets, and experiment with the game's mechanics and physics, however it isn't the flawless 10/10 experience, there are some issues, which fortunately can be fixed in the sequel:

- The weapon break mechanic, the major problem;
- I missed the music playing in the background while exploring, I wish it was more present in those moments;
- I was disappointed by the lack of traditional zelda dungeons. The divine beasts is the only thing in the game that resembles a typical zelda dungeon in terms of scope and reward, despite using a different design philosophy. A possible solution to that would be reduce the number of shrines by 1/3 and use the cut content to build 10 more complex dungeon with a unique boss fight
that would upgrade an existing special item, or give another special item at the end of it, I think this
would feel more safisfying and rewarding than just spirits orbs;
- Blight bosses could be more distinct and memorable;
- The Hyrule Castle section is quite simple to be the ""final dungeon"";
- Dark Beast Ganon falls into one of the curses of the games, being just another generic giant boss, the battle against him doesn't have that climax feeling of a final battle against the true form of evil, it's simple and without challenge, it consist in just waiting and hiting weak spots and that's it, although it ends with a good cinematic scene.

I believe the sequel has even more potential to be truly amazing, as the first game felt more like an introduction to a great story that is coming, and the solid foundation is already built.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

You get so immersed into the game and everything you can do, spending hours not even advancing the main storyline. However, it's not the best Zelda game I've ever played. The change from dungeons to shrines was a little sad for me.

GreenMenace,27-10-2019,"This game is a masterpiece. This is a game that I will compare all open world genres to. That's why I say that. The attention to detail is incredible. I compared the way I solved the various puzzles with a friend and the two of us solved most of the puzzles differently. That's just plain awesome. It's like the player themselves are interacting with the game. Few people will actually play the game the same way. I was skeptical about the idea of being able to solve a puzzle in several different ways (mostly because I thought it would make the game too easy), but this game pulled it off. I'm excited for BOTW 2 and I hope it improves upon BOTW.

Pros
This is the prettiest game on the switch
This is a huge world. Very few people have explored everything inside of the game.
BOTW departs from the tedious parts of the Zelda formula and lets the player go at their own pace.
The attention to detail is great. You can interact with objects, terrain, and enemies in a lot of different ways.

Cons
It's possible to skip pretty much the entire storyline if you don't know better.
While the characters are likeable enough, they don't contribute much.
The soundtrack.
You have to teach yourself just about everything. A little more direction would have been nice imo.
The enemies and items were great, but I would have liked more variety.
BOTW lacks replay value, but this is somewhat compensated by the fact that each save file can last hundreds of hours.

Link doesn't really ""scale"" in this game. The game only becomes more forgiving of his mistakes as he progresses. There are certain aspects of combat you need to learn to be successful. Otherwise, you will get destroyed by the enemies. For me, this was the most difficult combat in a Zelda game, and it was difficult in not a fun way. I was annoyed that enemies that were clearly supposed to be weak were able to two shot Link until I learned about certain aspects of the game. Additionally, this isn't the sort of game you want to start a new game after beating it. I don't want to run on foot again across the world. The dungeons were cool, but the bosses were only okay. The fun part of the experience lies within the exploration of the world. The soundtrack puts me to sleep. It isn't bad, but It's very bland (aside from Kass's theme). I could turn the music off and have the same experience. There needs to be more variety of music in the game. The main theme for BOTW is great, but I didn't encounter it until the end credits.

All in all, this game was far from my favorite Zelda game, but I can appreciate it for what it does well. I hope BOTW 2 takes note of what fans are saying and make the necessary changes to make the game more fun than it already is. I think it's a must have on the switch because of what it does well. It's fun to approach an enemy camp, decide how to ambush it, and enact your plan. It's fun to collect items as you explore or as you loot your enemies. It's fun once you figure out what you're doing, and you start getting more creative.

This was a great game and it was well worth my time and money. I would recommend it.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

My only complaints are number 1 a confusing interface that will take you time to get used to.Like cooking for instance , why is it not an option when by a fire? You have to go into the menu and then select up to 5 ingredients and then throw them into a pan. Which makes sense but it should explain it all better.Then theres the weapons breaking which is ok its just that its rare for one to last more than a battle or two.Then theres is random non sense like getting killed by lightning ? Im all for a higher difficulty its just sometimes some of the deaths feel extremely cheap and unbalanced.

I think they are on the right track and i am honestly looking forward to a sequel.

I was new to the Zelda series and didn't know if the land of hyrule could immerse me like other worlds. I didn't know if I would be captivated by Link. I didn't know if I would enjoy the gameplay. All I knew was that the game looked breathtaking and ambitious; and with an exciting and revolutionary console, I was eager to give it a try.
Needless to say, all of my fears were swept to the wayside just a few hours in. The world, soundtrack, gameplay, everything. I couldn't stop playing and quickly found myself addicted.
I was taking hundreds of screenshots; I was exploring every inch of the world; I was doing it all with a smile on my face.

The NPC’s are interesting, and charismatic, and the side quests are also nice Bosses: the game gives you so many ways to defeat bosses, once your weapon breaks, you find a new way, and another one. There’s so many options to choose from.

Combat: I really enjoy the combat since there’s so many ways to improve, every time you fight a new boss you just get better, and better. Music: the music is very nice and calming, it really fits with the whole atmosphere of the game Story: it gives you a sense of progression, and freedom. You could do whatever you want, however you wanna do it. Overall: I could see myself enjoying this game for years, with so many side quests, interesting characters, new swords, and armor to find. I could never see myself getting bored of this game . I’ll give it a 11/10",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Sijun,27-08-2019,"Zelda games always have a special place in my heart. Since I was a little boy I played Zelda games on NES, Gameboy and the SNES. Then I stepped away from playing video games entirerly until the Switch got released. The first game I bought was BotW and man it is a blast. Now, two years later I have played nearly 500h and still cant get enough of it.
My biggest pros:
- its Zelda
- its open world
- its absolutely beautiful and lovley
- its atmospheric like no other Zelda game
- it has great music
- it has great survival aspects

biggest cons
- close to no voice acting (but that is just a minor con really)
- it has an end",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
kitch,27-08-2019,"Breath of the Wild is a fantastic experience, the world is beautiful and full of things to do even small little things like killing off a group of enemies in a creative way, finding the Korok seeds or finding a shrine. The only thing I can do is nitpick at minor things. For me personally the shrines lack their previous character as does gannon just feeling like a monster rather than a main antagonist. Overall the core gameplay of Breath of the Wild is perfect it just lacks a little bit of extra character and style on top.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

If i had ever played a perfect game, it would've been Zelda Breath Of The Wild. The world is a vast, sprawling open world, teeming with life and enemies to kill. You have your usual Zelda towns: Gerudo, Kakariko, Hateno and More. There are 4 dungeound, or Divine Beasts. Most are fairly easy, with an exception for Vah Naboris, whhich kade me come back kager on in my playthrough. The game also includes Ganon, the Master Sword and Memories, whoch are my favourite things to collect, and each provide an insight into the world 100 years ago. As for the story, it can mostly be found in the memories and is very minimal anyway. However, Zelda BOTW is almost perfect in every way.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Además de que tienes la posibilidad de vencer al jefe final casi desde un principio, pero claro, el jugar y visitar todo el mapa te da la ventaja de ir mejor preparado.

Honestly that would be my only gripe. Not worth taking a point off the score of a perfect game. Also, I wasn't expecting so much heart(lol, no pun intended) in a Zelda game.

Los pueblos son legendarios una vez mas, tal y como en otros grandes juegos de la saga, y no digamos sus personajes. Un juego que roza la perfección, pero que nos deja con ganas de las legendarias mazmorras y jefes finales que son característicos de la Leyenda de Zelda. Aun así, un juego de mas de 10 que esperamos en su secuela pueda reforzar los puntos flojos que esta edición nos dió, sin embargo, para ser el inicio de estas nuevas y revolucionarias mecánicas de juego, un diez sin dudarlo, gracias Nintendo por darnos esta belleza de juego.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Breath of The Wild es un juego que cambia suficientes mecánicas para dar la sensación de ser algo novedoso sin eliminar las suficientes para que deje de ser un Zelda. Sin duda un clásico instantáneo que se vuelve una compra obligada bien sea porque tengas Wii U o Switch.

Lo Bueno:

- Un soplo de aire fresco en una franquicia con más de 20 años en los hombros.
- Un maravilloso mundo abierto por descubrir.
- Nuevas mecánicas que llevan al gameplay a otro nivel.

Lo Malo:

- Me hizo falta la experiencia de Mazmorra tradicional.

This game is not only a true revolution to the zelda Series, but to the Open-World Genre at full. This immense amount of freedom and lust for experimentation and exploration i have never seen in any game till this day. Therefore, even if some areas like the story and the dungeons surely can be approved in future, the sense of wonder this game sparks in the player has no equal seen to this day.

So the highest rating is definetly deserved.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SilverGriever,06-09-2019,Not my favorite Zelda but damn impressive in almost every way.

Lilmeeb,25-09-2019,"This game is absolutely phenomenal! Everything is so good! From the exploration to the characters to the puzzles, it's the evolutionary next step for the Legend of Zelda series. The Gameplay: The gameplay of Breath of the Wild is near perfection, it's simple from the outside as you can run, jump, climb, fight and glide but when all these mechanics are combined the right way you are a force to be reckoned with. Look out Lynels! The exploration: The exploration of Breath of the wild is one of the main selling points and is what you will be doing most of the game from looking for shrines to stumbling across 1 of the 900 hidden Korok seeds, there is a lot of exploration in this game that simply getting from point A to point B takes a long time but not because it's far away but because you WILL get sidetracked many times on your journey just by simply seeing something interesting in the distance and saying to yourself ""What is that?"" and you just go to see what ""that"" is. And that is what this game is about, you don't get crazy awesome rewards for everything you do, you get the experience of playing the game and having fun while doing it with the feeling of what will I do after this or how do I even do this popping up quite often. This game is a must have and you don't really understand what's so good about Breath of the Wild until you actually play it.

Trenk2009,14-02-2023,"An absolutely amazing journey carried by organic gameplay diluted in a charming world, giving an incredible sense of wonder and adventure!

Pros:
- Zelda BOTW world manages to embody to almost perfection the ""less is more"" concept.
Traversing the new open-world Hyrule has never been as rewarding and refreshing, as everything seems to have been crafted with such care.
- Solid, simple, yet efficient traversal mechanics; allowing for a great deal of freedom to explore that vast world.
- Creative, complex, and organic gameplay mechanics overall, allowing for a load of player expression when it comes to fighting, solving puzzles, or interacting with the world itself.
- Visually charming, with efficient cell shading effects and great art style overall.
- Music themes and the overall sound design are great.
- A decent deal of difficulty, especially early on.

Cons:
- Performance issues in some parts of the world.
- The overall narrative (even if it never was a strong suit of the Zelda franchise) is very barebone for the most part. Ofc, it's not as convoluted or cryptic as a Souls Game, but it still lacks a bit of depth imo.

MazrimTaim14,14-10-2019,"If you want to do an open world then this is how to do most aspects of it.

Navigation or how you traverse the open world is very vital since it will make travel less dull and more exciting. The paraglide and the swinging of spidey is what makes the map more fun to navigate.

The puzzles and the shrine system is also a great way instead of the usually unlocking of map icons just for the sake of going there.

Combat is something of a downer which is understandable since its a zelda game. Also didnt like the breaking mechanic of weapons. Never did like this concept although i understand it halts the power creep problem of rpgs nowadays with weapons getting more and more stronger and with the breaking mechanic is kind of like a gold sink. Still, even bows?

Storywise, its unmemorable. Story progression is nice in a way that the game takes into account sequence breaking.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Orthodoxist,09-10-2019,"This game is good, better said, really good. It is probably a must have if you own a Switch. However, the environmental storytelling, together with some limitations in gameplay, didn't make me love it. I just enjoyed the world, but it didn't stuck. Must have played about 50 hours and then moved on, never bothered to complete all the side quests as I never thought the rewards were important enough

Pros:
+ Freedom of movement: if you see a place, you can get there, one way or another
+ Physics! It feels good!
+ No performance issues
+ I honestly don't mind the lack of dungeons, I think that the puzzles are OK and some of the sanctuaries require brains

Cons:
- The story is a bit too simple. I understand the allegoric character of the story, but still, it was not enough
- Weapon durability. The day my favorite weapon broke was very sad.
- I think the variety of combat options, which is in principle good, makes the combat cumbersome, as you spend half of the time changing powers/weapons/arrows
- I found some side characters annoying
- Can't believe Link doesn't have voice yet.
- I would have appreciated a less modular approach in the game (defeat these 4 bosses and then go to the Castle). Bosses themselves. Likewise, random appearance of monsters at night is quite annoying while you're trying to explore.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Beyondthesoul,08-11-2019,"Let me start off by saying the Exploration is amazing. As soon as you start you can head in any direction you want. You can even go straight too the final boss if you want that is how open the game is.

The soundtrack is fantastic not the best I’ve ever heard but very good. The sound effects are good but the weapons could sound like they actually have impact and make me feel like I’m actually hitting something.

I love all the characters I’ve met during my journey but with games from the 2013’s and on everyone needs to be voice acted unless they are mute or something. It really brings me out of my immersion when two characters are standing next to each other with text boxes are popping up when they could just speak to each other.

Another problem for me is the durability of the weapons they should last a lot longer than 7 or 8 swings especially when it’s a sword. A lot of games seem to have this problem so I’m not taking it out on the game.

I’m kinda new too Nintendo games but the controller should have button remapping for new users during gameplay. That way it feels more inviting too new users that are used too other platforms.

Last problem I have is the main character Link he’s very lifeless and has no emotions to anything. I understand that’s how he’s always been but with what is expected of games nowadays he should’ve been voice acted and show to have more emotion from things.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
ElephantEric,04-11-2019,"This is a fantastic game. It has an immersive world, beautiful animation, and plenty of additions to the franchise. While the game is amazing, I feel that there are problems.

ragnarokandroll,17-11-2019,"This game, to me, is a masterpiece. In many ways it feels like the other Zelda games but there are new elements incorporated. This is one of those games that I had trouble putting down and when I beat it I wished there was more, in a good way.

The main dungeons are fewer in number but very engaging and present challenge. There are a lot of mini-dungeons (called shrines) and finding them gets a little tedious after 80-ish but once inside the shrines they are not tedious at all. The shrines are surprisingly unique and engaging for how many of them there are. There is a lot of exploration in this game; it feels like elder-scrolls in this aspect, IMO.

This game has breakable weapons and even the master sword requires recharging but I didn't find this frustrating. I always seemed to have enough weapons that did good damage as there are a lot of them to find. I don't see the point of it but I don't think it detracts from the game.
Not as much music as I expected but it fits well with the mood of the game.

JellyGamer,18-11-2019,"This was the best game I've played in a long time. The sheer scope of it was overwhelming and the amount of content kept me playing for an incredibly long time. It may well be my favourite Zelda game.

Pros:
The freedom: this game allows you to explore an entire region.
The design: a really beautiful looking game, the world was completely immersive.
The puzzles: many puzzles of varying difficulty. Each one feels rewarding.
The story: an itriguing story with (mostly) good pacing and endearing characters.
Value: there's just so much to do, it kept me engaged for a very long time.
A Good Impression: This was the first game I played on the switch and gave a very good impression.

Cons:
Endgame: You cannot keep playing after defeating the final boss. You must go back to a previous save in order to keep enjoying the world. I would have preferred some sort of postgame or the option to keep playing afterwards. (Having said that, as a sequel has now been announced, this makes more sense).

nanoka,18-11-2019,"This one is one of the best games I've ever played (and I've played plenty). The cons the game has got are double-cleared by all the great things it has. Another thought: there is NO game like this. There are tons of games that are set in an open world, but none gives you such freedom. There are ones which make you bound by the story, ones which make you bound by the gameplay. You can search for a very long time, but there isn't anything that uses all the open world ideas from our childhood like Breath Of The Wild. Do you remember how we always wanted a whole world in a game? The one with no restrictions, with no place we cannot go because going that direction is not provided by a developer. Here you can do whatever you want. One can spend hours of gameplay inside, with no constant rush because of a story. There are games which throw a player into a dissonance: here is a world to explore, please, hurry, you've got things to do. Here, the quests game gives are so unthinkable titanic you just take you time while doing them. Of course, there is no reason to pass on the game with such possibilities.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

AlSteiger,07-10-2022,"My first Nintendo game. A lot of emotions.

The graphics, although simple, are pleasant and do not cause a feeling of some kind of unreality of what is happening, or ""toylike"". Although the combat mechanics themselves are quite limited, everything is compensated by the physics of the world, opening up huge opportunities for the player, both in combat and in the usual study of the world.

The story is amazing, but the main story is only a small part of what the game provides. Secondary tasks, which are quite well hidden around the world, quite form an independent storyline that tells about the problems of ordinary people in this world.

Lots of micro-mechanics, cooking, upgrading or creating items, the need to change equipment depending on the zone or your personal goal.

A huge number of events in the world that occur both randomly and when a certain event or time of day is reached. Worldbosses that present a separate challenge for the player, and which you want to go through again and again trying different features of the game.

You can spend a lot of time in this game, and it is unlikely that you will be able to get bored, because even after 200 hours it will have something to surprise you with.

The only thing that I personally would like to add to this game is a cooperative opportunity when exploring the world. It is so huge that sometimes you want to visit it with someone.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The ending is the only thing i dont like that much. The Ganon fight is pretty easy and we didnt see what happend after the ending of the game. Especially that we didnt hear a single word about the Zeldas ""love"" for Link she showed in the newer memories.
But hopefully we'll get some ""Hyrule after..."" information or a realationship between Link and Zelda in the sequel thats been announced.

Jarsh,20-01-2020,"Here we have what will probably be the new template for future Zeldas to come. For an era, we had 3D Zeldas using Ocarina of Time as a template, and Nintendo finally saw fit to try something different. However, ""different"" doesn't automatically mean ""good"" and Breath of the Wild, for all of the interesting ideas it has, also has a lot of missteps. I'll start with my biggest problem the game has: the lack of variety. You will spend a lot of time climbing and traversing, and you won't get that much out of it except for the journey itself. For some, this is enough. To deviate for a moment, Nintendo has brought back an idea that existed since The Wind Waker, the ability to use enemy weapons; this time, you can keep the weapon and add it to your inventory. Only, all the weapons in the game are breakable (some a lot more than others). So to reward your exploration, the game doles out these breakable weapons and Korok seeds for solving minor puzzles. Only, there are so many weapons to find in the game, you'll soon have seen all of them after playing just for several hours, and, when the time comes to be rewarded, you'll be given a weapon that's likely worse than eight others you have on you already. Now, the Korok seeds are used mainly to increase inventory limits, but there are a bunch of them in the game. It sounds useful, but in practice, it really isn't. BotW throws so much stuff at you that it doesn't really matter how many arrow you can carry at a given time since there's probably a bundle of them waiting for you a short jaunt away. The best rewards you are given via shrines are Spirit Orbs, used to upgrade your hearts and stamina.

So, I've covered that the general gameplay reward loop isn't the most satisfying thing, is ""the journey"" itself at least fun enough to justify playing through it? Sometimes, but not always. This is the first Zelda in a while where dungeons aren't really the focus, and to me, it's a major detriment. Gone are the themed temples such as the Forest Temple, City in the Sky, etc; instead, there are four dungeons inside the Divine Beasts. This by itself isn't bad, after all, Majora's Mask had a measly four dungeons as well and was an excellent game. The problem is that all these dunegons look the same. They all have the same brown walls, and to boot, they're pretty short and easy, even by Zelda standards. The only things that really stand out regarding each dungeon is the location they're in, which you can see from the inside, which is kind of neat, but not enough to make up for the overall lacking atmosphere.

Then, another big part of the game are the shrines in the overworld. These are a bit better than the Divine Beasts but not by a lot. The puzzles are more clever, probably because they're optional content, so that most players don't have to use their heads if they don't want to; however, the same problem with the temples rears its ugly head yet again: they all look the same. That leaves the locales themselves, and they genuinely look great and different from each other. The overworld clearly had some effort put into making each area look unique.

The combat is perhaps one of the better things about the game, as you do have a few more options compared to the past Zelda games; you could plant bombs, for instance, to explode as an enemy approaches them instead of hacking them up. Or shoot them from above, the game has plenty of moments that give you multiple ways to approach a situation. Another issue here is that most of these enemies will be brainless fodder, like bokoblins that the game reuses all over the map. You won't have a problem outsmarting them the first time, nor any time thereafter. Luckily, there are harder enemies like Lynels and Hinox, but the variety of enemies, like with many aspects of this game, is lesser than it should have been.

Zelda is a series often known for its score, and here we have another area where BotW lacks, there's hardly any overworld music aside from a couple piano notes here and there; this might be a positive for some people since I see where the lack of sound would add to a sense of solitude. So this is where I've seen a trend: BotW is a game with good bones, even great bones, but it's lacking in variety in many, many ways. Recalling the game in broad strokes, I can remember some fun I had in puzzles, a few enemy encounters and an island in which you lose everything in your inventory and have to use your wits more than any other part of the game. These moments are what makes the game worthwhile, but we just need more in the sequel. I'm honestly a bit surprised this game is rated by critics as highly as it is since I see many areas that improvements are needed. When BotW 2 comes out, or perhaps a few Zeldas from now that fix this game's mistakes all around, will people still look back on this game as fondly?",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Rick-Cast,07-12-2020,"I have not played Nintendo games since I was a child...but I remember Majora's Mask being my top favourite one. This is the first time playing one in years and I am so loving Breath of the Wild.
One of the most charming and immersive games, this may be the first time I ever gave a game perfect score. The amount of freedom with such little guide to let you explore and experiment in the world of Hyrule may be one of the biggest highlights in this game, you are able to do whatever you want whenever you want. I find so much fun to using the world environment to my advantage to fight enemies and preserve my equipment like shooting a hornets nest near them. The story is very simple but the mystery of what happened 100 years ago is what makes it very interesting.
The combat is surprisingly complexed; like how u have total freedom to do whatever you want, there are various way to damage an enemy with a variety of weapons that have their own distinctive advantages and disadvantages.
The music and graphic are great, no words are needed however what I love more is that the game doesn't hold your hand and treating you like as if you don't what to do like in many Sony and Microsoft games. You are completely on your own in this game and that makes it feel more rewarding to learn new tricks and news skill all by yourself.

dennisonmeta,20-01-2020,"The Zelda game that doesn't really feel like a Zelda game.

Don't get me wrong: I really dig this game. The freedom you get to quite literally do whatever the hell you want is (in my humble gaming experience) unparalleled. You get to choose whether or not you pursue the main bad guy in this game, which is a form of Ganon, unsurprisingly. You could also just help out NPCs, collect Korok seeds, raid Bokoblin settlements or whatever combination of the above. The thing is that I don't really see Breath of the Wild as a Zelda game. It just happens to kinda sorta actually really look like a Zelda game. Perhaps that's because I haven't progressed the main story enough to actually get to Zelda (I don't even know if you can actually meet her) but I guess my thought process says more about what I think a Zelda game usually is.

So then, what is a Zelda game usually? Link is the chosen one, he meets a wise entity, gets his main item (some would say gimmick), gets an assistant, has to collect 4/6/8 of a certain kind of item (sometimes twice), the assistant nags him to no end, Link can't jump, there's an atrocious water level, the music is iconic, some iteration of Impa/Princess Zelda/Deku Tree, we are reminded Ganon, Link and Zelda all have a triangle that emits light on their hand (and is normally invisible except for during *the* cutscene) and Ganon dies. That's usually the gist of it. Does the deviation from the formula make Breath of the Wild a bad game? Not in the slightest. I mean yes, you could make it so the Luminescent Triangle Hand Gang never meets 100 years after the Calamity (the details escape me) but that doesn't restrict you in the way that older (Zelda) games would have: ""Haven't gotten a certain item? Sorry, no Light temple for you."" This makes the likelihood of you getting the absolute sh!t beaten out of you greater, but there are usually ways around that, either through sneaking or avoiding an area altogether.

One problem- or rather, annoyance- that I do have with this game is the inventory. It's not hearing the same two sounds for the map and the inventory over and over and over and over again, but the slots available. Many times I've made it to the 'Bonus Chest' in a Shrine only to have the game tell me my inventory is full and spending the next five minutes deciding whether or not the Flame Rod is really worth keeping for the *one* instance where it would be helpful. I haven't had much of an issue with the durability of items, though.
So if I had to nitpick and find something bad in this game, that would be it. If you own a Switch and don't have this game, think about what our old pal Reggie once said: ""What's wrong with you?""",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The open world is huuge and full of details. Visuals are beautiful and astonishing. Music perfectly appropriated for a long and lonely journey (seriously, this game needs a peaceful music, no a constant guitar riff). Fight mechanics are absolutely coherent with the idea of the game.

In games, as food, music or any other stuff in life, there are different grades of maturity and not all pieces are enjoyable for everybody in the same degree.

The graphics are quite pretty, and I feel like if they hadn't gone with cell-shaded graphics, this game wouldn't have been as easy to look at.

This game runs not-so-great at times, particularly in Korok Forest, iirc. All I can say is, this would be a fantastic game to market alongside a Switch Pro.

The gameplay is hard to talk about with devolving into tangents. There is nothing boring about playing this game. You can go ""literally everywhere."" There is a freedom to the game that could allow you to even go straight from the tutorial to the final boss and have a decent chance of winning, if you're careful and well-prepared enough. Story? Besides the final boss, all optional. Objectives? Sure, there are places you are ""supposed"" to go to, but the fact is that you don't have to.

There is endless enjoyment to be had in this game. As of now I have ~350 hours logged in this game, and I would replay it again in a heartbeat.

Passwurdz,12-01-2022,"Considering this is an open world game and people highly praise it for being so. I felt encouraged to just go my own direction and not focus that much on the main quest related stuff for a while. The result of this bad choice was that I explored over 60% of the map, maybe even more. By not having the sword that seals the darkness nor any upgraded inventory space since I first encountered the kuko seed guy.
How it affected my gameplay:
While having quite a limited amount of breakable melee weapons.. you don't exactly wanna use up your best ones on trash mobs or worst of all, risk having almost no weapons before a proper battle. This made me feel somewhat forced to use the bombs with nearly all the enemies in the game, which played out like this: Drop bomb, kite, drop bomb, kite, repeat until victory. In some cases I could drop the round bomb and then the squared one and stagger the enemy which was quicker. But was it fun? Not particularly.
Another consequence of this inventory space is that damn near every chest that provided me with a weapon was one I just had to pass on due to being full. Which doesn't exactly increase motivation to find chests.
So in conclusion, it is open world with the emphasis on how you should go to one exact place on the map for an unbreakable sword and inventory upgrades in order to have a good experience. However this location isn't marked on the map and needs to be found. A rather idiotic design choice, why have markers on the beasts for instance? You could see them from across the other side of the map almost..
So why did I not go into the forest to get the sword? Well after having cleared the third beast and seen 75% of the map or so. The area grabbed my attention. One thing thats actually really great about the game is the climbing and glide mechanics. You don't have to walk around a mountain, you can go over it if you want to. I often did such things. So I was in the lava area and decided to glide into that dark forest. As I got close to it I got teleported away. Why would that happen? Naturally I assume that this area is locked, off limits for the time being. That I must probably do something main quest related to make it available to me. So while being relatively sick of my weapons and inventory space I proceeded to get the 4th beast and I actually just went straight to ganon afterwards. I have had enough at that point.
It was a pretty tedious experience towards the end and I really missed a more propper rpg feeling, it wasn't very engaging to focus on armor or weapons or the character progression. It was in fact very limited and underwhelming.

I do understand that if one isn't as unlucky as me and goes to the forest early, the experience would be better. Most likely a 7/10 experience, maybe even a 8/10 experience. But that this game is considered the holy grail and a 10/10 from so many is just absurd. But maybe most Nintendo players aren't PC gamers as well? If this is about all you know or have tried in your life then I can understand it to be an overwhelmingly good experience. If I were to rate it on my experience alone instead of considering the technical elements of the game then I would go as low as 4/10. But since I understand the potential of the game and its many good aspects, I landed on 6/10.

Considering how its such a perfect game you'd probably expected me to be done with the negatives, in fact how could I even write this much? Oh I am not done yet.
Let me introduce the lightning effect. The first time it took place was when I had ventured a bit far north and was about to rescue an npc. The lightning begun and struck me twice until I died. I thought it was rather strange and wonder why it happened, concluded maybe I needed some special lightning gear or that I wasn't really supposed to be that far north so early.
Eventually it happened in other places and I didn't understand why it was so aggressively targeting me. Eventually I noticed the dragon and concluded it must be his fault and that I must kill him. I tried once but my attacks didn't land.. Ever since then I felt like I had no choice but to teleport away from my area if the lightning arrived, very fun! After my playthrough I learned that it happened because of the metal sword/shield I was carrying. Is that a connection everybody but me just knows just like that? There's plenty of metal in most umbrellas that people carry around in rain and thunderstorms, you don't see them getting struck every second. I can take some self criticism on this part, but I felt like at least some in-game characters could have warned me.
Coincidentally I learnt about the thunder crown in the desert not long afterwards and thought it was the solution! However I had to do all the quests in the desert and instructions like ""go directly south of the village"" to find someone etc wasn't sufficient. I didn't find what I was supposed to and gave up.

Normally in games I would attempt to do everything but either the side quests were bland or the game just didn't feel as fun after such a long time of playing that I just left it for a while. Meanwhile with this game, I could not stop playing!",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Sanghelic,11-04-2020,"the legend of zelda botw definitivamente no revoluciono los juegos de mundo abierto, pero logro adaptarlo al mundo de zelda y construir la jugabilidad a partir de esta base de forma estupenda, un juego muy entretenido con muchisima libertad, donde no importa donde explores, siempre tienes un lugar a donde ir, realmente divertido, un problema que tiene son las mazmorras y los jefes, estos eran el atractivo principal en los juegos anteriores pero lamentablemente no lograron mantenerse interesados con esta nueva jugabilidad, sin embargo estas duran muy poco y no son el enfoque principal del gameplay, la historia tambien es bastante simple, aunque para ser un juego de zelda al menos cumple con su objetivo de darte un contexto, ademas de romper con los estereotipos que los mismos juegos de zelda habian impuesto como no darle voz a los personajes principales o el hecho de que todos los anteriores juegos de zelda intentaban ocultar que era exactamente ""la amenaza"" a pesar de que siempre resultaba ser ganon. en general un juego disfrutable, simple y entretenido",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ThePSButton,27-05-2020,"Vamos a enfocarnos en lo negativo porque críticas positivas le sobran:

-El sistema de degradación de armas fue un error horrible, hay mejores maneras de hacer que los jugadores usen distintas armas. Lo único que logran es que las armas raras al final sean igual de irrelevantes que cualquier rama.

-La narrativa es muy débil. Tener que encontrar esos lugares secretos para que te cuenten el grueso de la trama fue la peor decisión posible.

-Solo 4 calabozos y están entre los más sosos y olvidables de la franquicia.

-Un villano sin personalidad.

-Un mundo abierto que se siente vacío y plano.

-El juego emergente es una de sus fortalezas, pero lo llevan a extremos ridículos como el sistema de la lluvia y trepar.

-Las misiones secundarias son muy malas y completamente olvidables.

-La actuación vocal (en inglés) es horrible.

En fin, BotW tiene mucho que admirarle, pero sus puntos flacos son muy evidentes y algunos de ellos afectaron mi disfrute del juego.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

BadLandsHere,14-04-2020,"My favorite game of all time. Its fun, the game gives you so much solutions for any problem you have that there is no wrong or right way to play. The weapons breaking forces you to get more creative, the runes, the paraglider and the divine beast powers really make the gameplay varied. This is a game which mixes the physics and combat together. You could throw your sword to the ground and use magnesis to float it as a way of killing a distant enemy. Most enemy bases have a way of being dealt with in a smart way, but that doesnt mean the smart way that is quite obvious like rolling a boulder on the enemies or exploding barrels always works well, one time i tried to kill a whole enemy camp with just a few exploding barrels and my bomb rune and boy did it not go well. The dungeons were fine, they werent good but not bad either. My personal favorite was the setup to the Goron Divine Beast. The game's tutorial doesnt bore you unlike most Zelda games and it can be completed in about 40 minutes if you know what you are doing. The shrines are a good way of challenging the player with puzzles that sometimes get pretty difficult, but the shrines arent frustrating like you'd expect, they are just fun! The story is good in my opinion. Its not complex or detailed but finding memories is a pretty interesting and fun mechanic. I'd say this is the best Zelda game ever, even better than OOT, which i have always seen as overrated.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Players can experience Hyrule as a living, breathing place with adventure, puzzles, and environmental story telling at every turn. Nintendo’s managed to craft a game that feels completely unique while still keeping the tried-and-true Zelda feel at its core. This is a true progression of not only an incredible series, but a progression of how open world games are experienced. Every player is able to create a story of their own while they embark on their journey. Puzzles and tasks usually have countless ways of being solved, leaving it up to the player’s imagination and skill level to solve it how they see fit. The music, art and sound design beautifully aids the game in its somber story about a lone adventurer facing a world 100 years after its own destruction.

ProsandCons,26-06-2020,"This game deserves every single award you can give it multiple people (mostly users) are giving it zeros, probably trolls but if any of them are serious, you really would like Sonic Rise of Lyric. This game has taken every single part of the current Zelda games and threw it out the window. It feels like it came out this year and it's amazing, graphics are really cool and they added in multiple features to the game that you cannot find anywhere else in the Zelda franchise, for example, you have multiple weapons and each one breaks after a certain amount of hits, meaning you have to switch mid-combat and fight with that weapon, as difficulty goes, of course, there is a singular difficulty setting unless you buy the DLC and get Master Mode, then the entire game is much harder, I am pointing this out because it has an interesting way of making sure you don't go anywhere someone new shouldn't like if you get too close to Hyrule Castle you'll be toe to toe with a guardian, and if you're fresh off the great plateau you're gonna run and be away from Hyrule Castle but if you've gained the Master Sword and ancient arrows your gonna beat that thing up and continue on your journey. My first ten minutes off of the great plateau were running away from guardians. The open-world concept is something that fans will love! There are many easter eggs for those who have played past games and there are many ways someone new can learn the combat system, the game actually has voice actors for some of the characters (not including Link) and it's amazing how good it is, you can go at any pace and can even choose to just barge into Hyrule Castle and beat up Ganon right off the great plateau. All considered The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is for open-world gamers that like exploring and combat. If you have a switch, PLAY IT.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

f0uwu,13-11-2020,"The Legend Of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a milestone in open-world games. Instead of having most of the content in a single place, It spreads it out over the whole map so you never feel like your in the wrong place. Unlike most open worlds, it doesn't tell you directly where to go. Nothing is really directly told to you, and that's the magic of this game. Discovery. When you first start the game you have no idea what to do, where to go, and what can happen. In BOTW, you don't have complete control of everything. The world feels alive and real, and you actually have to discover things. Instead of telling you where all the shrines and villages and stables are, you have to discover them if you want to see it on the map. That's the joy of discovery in breath of the wild.
But you also discover things like links abilities, which of course I won't talk about so you can discover them yourself. But enough about that... on to the combat and puzzles. Let's start with the shrines, which serve as mini-dungeons.
I love the puzzles in this game. Instead of one obvious solution, the are many creative solutions to the puzzles that force you to think outside the box. The shrines are spread out all over the map, so no matter where you're going you can always find them. Then, there are also 4 divine beasts which are more traditional Zelda puzzles. And these are so fun. The first one I've done so far, divine beast Vah Rutah starts in an epic shadow of the colossus-ey battle. Then, you enter it and it turns into a more traditional Zelda Dungeons, than ends in an epic boss battle against Waterblight Ganon which is very frustrating if you have stick drift, which segways into the final part of this review, the frustrations. Now, most of this stuff doesn't apply to the actual game, more if you have stick drift on your controller. If you have stick drift on your right controller (like me) this game can be unplayable. If you have it on the left, it's a minor annoyance. But besides that, this game is as perfect as an open-world game can get and I would recommend it to everyone. 9/10",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

nightstroller,30-04-2020,"What can I say that has not already been said about this game? It's a Zelda title and it's darn near perfect. I have a few personal qualms with the game, but I'm sure others see them as minor things (like weapon durability and the limited inventory space). Even after fulling maxing out your inventory slots, it doesn't feel like enough. But all of the flaws/faults I see are easily overlooked by all the great things this game has to offer.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Theuzetz,19-10-2020,"This game surprised me in every way possible. The game starts with link waking up from a hundred year nap, then he gets out of the cave, and you get a beautiful shot at Hyrule, at that point, you already know the game's gonna be good.
The game doesn't really hold your hand at all, it's not very challenging, but still, the fun of the game comes from exploring this vast world, the greatness of this game comes from climbing up a mountain, knowing there won't be anything up there, but you just want to climb it to have a view of hyrule from up there.
The story isn't really remarkable, it's not bad, but not anything mindblowing or too emotional, but that doesn't affect the game too much, since it's not story focused at all.
Link doesn't talk, but the rest of the characters feel very cohesive and different from each other, which makes it fun to explore hyrule looking for link's lost memories.
The game feels pretty balanced in general, although I personally think weapons break too fast, and there's too little variety of weapons, which makes for few standard combat styles, but that's not a problem, since you can pretty much however you want. Link acquires a few runes, which are normally used to solve puzzles, but the game gives you way too much freedom, enough for you to be able to use those runes in battle in any way you want, which can be pretty helpful.
This game is incredibly well praised, and it's truly deserved! A masterpiece of open world games, Breath of the Wild, Is one of the best games on switch, and rightfully won many prizes in the 2017 game awards (despite not being my favorite game of that year)",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The ability to get to any spot in Hyrule is great. The bosses are challenging to a LoZ novice such as myself and, when upsetting, provide a level of satisfaction upon victory that makes the frustration culminate into a worthwhile experience. What's keeps the game from being a 10 are the incredible number of korok seeds that make exploring more of a task rather than something to do for fun, which can be a bit disincentivizing to someone like myself.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
R0astedP1nata,09-07-2022,"Zelda is a series that obviously has an unreachable standard to meet, to the extent in which series' games that are satisfactory receive a disgusted reception. 2017's Breath of the Wild mediates this issue by refuting what its predecessors have done and takes design cues from old and new titles alike. In comparison, Breath of the Wild feels alien to works considered masterpieces, clearly Ocarina of Time. However, Breath of the Wild does carve out its own identity as a save the princess game. Many other Zelda games begin linear and gradual reveal an open world. Breath of the Wild does the same, but tricks the player into believing everything they are doing is of their own accord and they're the ones connecting the dots. Despite the sometimes trivial shrine quests, their discovery and completion is still the player's own and they feel the triumph that comes with besting a shrine that was clearly placed before them. If Ocarina of Time is da Vinci's Mona Lisa, a work that guides the audience through it through composition, Breath of the Wild is Seurat's Sunday Afternoon, a piece that shows everything at once but grants the privilege of sequence to the audience. This design philosophy extends to all the creatures of Hyrule. The Korok seed's require no collection of all, but their sprinkle across the map allows the player to distract themselves when and where they please to collect a few of the acorns. There is no penalty for ignorance towards them, but reward for getting lost in the moment-to-moment puzzles the little critters provide. The further provide the design of the world with a reach-around, great visual storytelling is implemented to breathe life into the chasms and cliffs of Hyrule. Villages of old are left in ruins, Lon Lon Ranch is scorched because the identity of Ocarina is a distant image in the rear-view mirror, and the only surviving civilisations are ones in the middle of expansive deserts, perilous volcanoes and impregnable valleys. While the difficult spike has a sharp fall for those who chose to get every gain they can early in their adventure, it is difficult to dislike Breath of Wild. It is one of the few games I have willingly bought additional content for, the music has ingrained itself in my mind to such an extent that my muscles tense when I hear the jingle of the guardians and the character of the titular Princess Zelda is actually... a character.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Daisuk,26-05-2020,"I had never played a Zelda game prior to Breath of the Wild - but boy, oh, boy, what a lovely game this is! It's a bit odd, as I consider it one of the best games I've ever played, yet the story in it is extremely forgettable (to the point of pointless), and a host of the characters in it are incredibly bland and downright boring - yet - the gameplay and the gameplay loop in BOTW is nothing short of superb. Exploration en masse, lots of weapons, enemies, caves, upgrades and puzzles to discover and solve. I played this for 130 hours before deciding it was time to march on the final boss (which in total took me maybe 20 minutes due to being very powerfully upgraded at that point) - there's just too much to explore in this game for it to be worth to rush the final boss too early.

The best part is just running around and defeating enemies. And its so rewarding when you get the master cycle zero if you get the DLC which i recommend getting because it adds a whole new story.

leohusun,27-05-2020,"Legend of Zelda-BOTW is an open-world game that stands out when compared to many others. As your adventure goes on, you become stronger not just because you have better equipments and more HP, but because the player yourself grows up as you get better understanding of the game mechanism and know all the possibilities in this open world. You perhaps face even stronger enemy later in the game, but maybe you are able to beat them with just a fair weapon or even worse weapons and do not lose any HP. The one that truly picks up the art of the combat is YOU behind the console. Such an experience can only be found in BOTW if you talk about games on switch.

Overall, the graphics are good, the DLC is worth it if you can dive into the game for 50 hours without getting bored. The plots are okay. The music is calm and peaceful. Simply 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

IvanPinesLol,22-11-2022,"This game's a masterpiece, it was extremely addicting. The world has so much content that even after finishing the game, you still have a lot more stuff to do, more side quests to do, it feels endless and that's freaking amazing.

I also love the combat, not only that you can use a variety of weapons and the amazing flurry rush, you can use the environment around you to fight your enemies. Rains with a shock weapon can create a shock field, fire that shoots ice lizards will instant kill them, ect.... This goes to show how much of a variaty of things you can use to your advantage against your foes.

The quests are amazing with countless puzzles to do and great stories to tell combined just gives me an orgasm. And the shrines, oh the shrines, are fun as heck, you don't just get everything in a press of a button but you have to earn your bonus which are spirit orbs by going through the puzzles the game gives you. This game unlike any other games that guides you through the whole quest by putting a dot in your map, botw doesn't hold your hand but it gives you enough information to guide you through your on going quest.

Now for the flaws, I kinda hate the weapon durability mechanic, when it breaks, it disappears. And then you have to go all the way back to where you found your weapon and take it back after the red moon. It's inconvenient af, and just annoying to just go back and fourth to get the weapon your already earned back again, why instead of creating a repairing mechanic they would rather make you retake it is beyond me. Secondly, some quests are pretty annoying, a lot of them forces you to collect some things that are pretty damn rare so you'll end up spending around 2 freaking hours to find them. Like some of the returning memories quest, the old guy was so hard find I just had to find the locations myself but it was too much of a pain in the ass so I had to search up the locations of all the memories.

But other than that, everything is perfect in botw, the flaws I just mentioned was the only reason why I didn't give this game a 10/10. To conclude, this game's no doubt a masterpiece and will go on my ""greatest games I've ever played"" list.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
deadlyb0,10-06-2020,"Zelda: Breath of the wild

After picking up this game for the WIIU I was surprised how badly the game performed some very choppy frame rates, frustrated me especially in the first town you visit. I failed to get into the game and always felt ripped off.
Fifty pound for the worst performing NINTENDO title I had ever seen on one of there consoles.

So roll on three years later having picked up a switch I was constantly thinking of taking the plunge and getting BOTW again even though the WIIU version was gathering dust on my shelf.
Having spent another fifty pounds (Yes one hundred quid) I actually started to get into the game, although the frame rate issues are still there they are only making brief more manageable appearances.
It must be said the game still looks great especially the cut scenes. One of the reasons I came back to this game was reviews overwhelmingly positive (97 on METACRITIC).
I struggle to feel the same way while this game is in no way a bad game, I really can’t understand the reviews. Maybe we are in a age of triple a big games have to get a big score. I am probably just being cynical.

I have so many issues with this game the controls are clumsy and fernicky to manage. Fighting the last boss I was still messing with the controls. Yes the world is open and your left to your own devices
but I found this mainly frustrating bordering on daft, sometimes even boring.
I’m not sure that’s what I want from a Zelda game. I have beat all the dark souls games and Sekiro ( Sekiro being the hardest of the lot ). BOTW difficulty is all over the place difficult to easy, that’s ok but not ideal. The main problem is its just frustrating most of the time, I cursed and shouted more at the TV then all the souls Bourne games put together. The shrines ended up being repetitive and boring.

The characters and the story felt bare to the bone. The music was easily the worst in any zelda game I have played. The weapon breaking system felt weird and unnecessary .
I don’t think weapons break that fast can I not maintain the weapon:).
I really didn’t get the sense of achievement or progression got from other Zelda games. Some quests don’t have any rewards why not give me a weapon its not like I am going to have it for long.
Jokes a side the boss designs are wooden devoid of life and mostly the easiest part of the game.

Zelda doesn’t need to be a open world game it hasn’t benefitted from it. Instead it has lost it magic of classic Zelda’s always moving forward, growing.
I don’t regret spending the money playing the game it definitely is worth a try. If Rumours of a BOTW2 are true I will be giving it a miss and going back to the Zelda classics.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

HERMIT1234567,16-06-2020,"Breath of the wild is the best exploration based open world game i ever play. World of hyrule is filled with secrets like shrines, mysterious ruins, mysterious creatures, mini games, korok seeds, quests, new settlements, some environmental details, etc. But they also hides this secrets most likely shrines by using vast stretches of land and it's terrains like mountains, cliffs, ruins, etc. This make finding them a navigational challenge. This force you to explore every nook and cranny to find everything. This makes world more immersive and interactive than any other open world game i ever play. Shrine quests give you many varieties in quests. Shrine follows old Nintendo rules to make their puzzles intriguing. I mean they introduced a concept in earlier part of shrines and increases challenge in later rooms. But many shrines are also one room which gives you a target but you had to find a way to solve puzzles by experimenting with its surroundings. It also causes many new ways to solve shrine puzzles. They are also physics based. It means you can find your own way to solve these puzzles. But this game has also some flaws like weapon durability system, small dungeon with same aesthetics, combat is fun because it encourages creativity but it also has too many flaws like flurry rush is broken, etc. But this game does many things better than any other games.

JimPickens,18-08-2021,"Breath of The Wild was only my second Zelda game after Ocarina of Time 3D, but even I could tell the game was a far cry from the basic Zelda formula, which both adds and subtracts from the experience in my opinion.

Fist of all.. oh baby this game is stunning, given the Switch's... relatively weak power output, many games have resigned themselves to unique art style > realism, which may be why I love the little thing so much, BoTW's art style is gorgeous, I found myself stopping in the middle of playing and just admiring the way the light reflected off the grass, or how the ruins of Hyrule looked from atop a mountain, it's so picturesque and I love every moment of exploration because of it.

In stark contrast to the beautiful visual design, I found myself very disappointed in the audio, it's all ambiance, except for combat and Hyrule Castle, and I didn't really notice before I got to Hyrule Castle and noticed a remix of the old Overworld theme and it was beautiful, but it made me realize how barren the rest of the world is, in a bad way. some chirpy exploration music would have been nice, I know everything is in ruins and it's meant to be sad, but come on, something would have been nice.

I hate to complain but, this version of Link, may be my least favourite of the 3D games. From Wind Waker onward Link has always been so expressive, and in a world with actual voice acting, you'd think Link would either have voice acting as well, or be EVEN MORE expressive than in Skyward Sword... he is not. Link barely emotes at all, even at the very end of the true ending after recovering all of Links memories and reuniting with Zelda, he doesn't even smile, he just stands there like a cute cardboard cutout. He doesn't react to fighting Ganon, he doesn't react to seeing long dead friends, he doesn't react to getting the Master Sword. I just hope this is fixed in the sequel, I've heard Link is quite expressive in Age of Calamity but I have yet to play that, so... hopefully it's fixed in the sequel.

Link aside, the rest of the characters are pretty great, I love Zelda in this, almost as much as Skyward Sword Zelda or Tetra, watching her struggle is so grounding. Zelda has always felt so far away with Tetra being the exception, even in Skyward Sword, she quickly outpaces you and in Twilight Princess she's barely even there, but here, you feel so close to her. Though less so with the Old Champions, I still felt close to them too, Mipha has funky voice acting but she's endearing nonetheless, and for some reason the second fish woman to fall for Link, not sure why, Rivali is fun in the ""I hate you"" kind of way, I can't help but like him, but I'd really like to know how the Rito and Zora exist at the same time when the RIto evolved from the Zora to adapt to the new world after the goddesses flooded Hyrule. I want Urbosa to step on me, that is all. Daruk is fun, I enjoy the big older brother type, and I know ""brother"" is a speech quirk all Gorons have, but I still like hearing it from him. Likewise I found the new Champions quite endearing, none of them stand out to me, but hey, at least they're alive.

Now for some totally original complaints that haven't been echoed a millions times already. Weapon degradation to too high, I don't like feeling nervous about using big cool shiny weapons I worked for, same goes for shields, but why can the Hylian Shield break? Isn't it meant to be the best shield? So doesn't breaking kind of negate that fact? The Master Sword doesn't break, even if it needs to recharge every few uses, at least it doesn't BREAK, what does that mean for the canon? is every Hylian Shield after this a replica?? I NEED ANSWERS NINTENDO! Next the dungeons, why aren't there any? The Sacred Beasts are fine, but get stale in design very quickly, none of their gimmicks are very interesting and the most fun part about them is how you get inside them, and the Shrines don't really make up for them either. And the story, why is all of it in Age of Calamity? There's a big story bit at the start, then some 40 hours later, a big story bit at the end, the middle is so empty, too empty, especially if you don't get all the memories or do all the Sacred Beasts, it's just disappointing.

Overall, I love this game, it's not personally my favourite Zelda game, nor do I think it's the best one, but it's definitely up there, it's fun and that can't be understated, the art is great, the story -when it actually bloody shows its face- is so enthralling, and the world is just breathtaking, no pun intended. I just wish it had better dungeons, a more expressive Link and some more prevalent music, those aside, one of the best games on the Switch, easily.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Benboj,23-06-2020,"This is an extremely great open world game. The amount of exploration in this game allows the player to sink hundreds of hours into it which I myself did. I have about 120 hours in this game over 2 saves and I've completed it once. To be fair, when I first started it I didn't really enjoy it that much. I wasn't very good at the combat and so I didn't really like going around and exploring because I'd always run into something that would kill me and it takes a decent while to get to the different objectives. But one day I returned to the game to play it again and I started to progress the story and I got better and the combat and suddenly I was hooked. Being able to find all kinds of weird ways to defeat your opponents was like a puzzle but also super rewarding. The shrines and divine beasts were also basically puzzles that at some times were quite challenging and took me a while to get. The boss battles were also challenging as they all had slightly different ways to defeat them. Also, the fact that things break is such a big deal as it means you can't just find the best sword and then power through the game with that, you actually have to be inventive and find other ways to defeat enemies. Using the bows were the most effective thing to do but arrows are also rare to come buy but the game does have shops in some villages and i spent alot of rupees buying all different kinds of arrows and random prices of armour.

The reason I'm not rating this higher is because although I like exploring in open world games i prefer to use things like planes an helicopters and cars and watch the explode as I drive off cliffs. I understand that isn't what the game is going for and it would be weird if link got into a helicopter and started firing missiles at ganon so im not saying that this game should have stuff like that im just saying I find open world games more fun when they do have stuff like that. In botw exploring can be tedious as you track for what feels like hours just to unlock a single shrine and i can't really think of a way to improve that because fast travel would just be too quick and then it would take away the exploring which is a big part of the game and most of the time is fun even if it is sometimes tedious.

What I'm saying is i prefer gta but this is still a great game by Nintendo that definitely deserved game of the year and i definitely see why some people may rate it higher than I did. Im still super hyped about part 2.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

INU4SH4,23-06-2020,"Adventuring through this Hyrule feels so refreshing, satisfying, and lonely. I loved every minute of it. This game is exactly what you would expect from a more mature retelling of the LoZ games. It plays like a classic 3D Zelda but at the same time feels brand-new and unique. There are only a small couple of other open-world games I can rank the same as LoZ: Breath of the Wild. Princess Zelda played a breath-taking role like usual, I love that character. Her design in this game is the best so far in my honest opinion. Also, I don't even feel attracted to guys, but Link looks really good in this game. The cross-dressing mission questioned my sexuality. Joke.

So, what are my complaints? Some shrines felt a tiny bit repetitive and too easy. Sometimes I also expected a greater challenge from bosses, but that's it.

Easily one of the greatest open-world adventure games I have ever played. I was very close to giving a perfect 10/10 to this one but there were very small things holding it down.

Not perfect, but almost perfect.

It enables emergent play with great freedom. This creates a challenge for the player.
Natural storytelling supports great freedom. This gives the player an immersion in the world.
It's a pity that there are few types of monsters and weapons destruction systems. However, the weapon destruction system is not an unconditional disadvantage in that it helps colorful play.
It's an almost perfect game with only a few shortcomings in terms of game elements. It can be said to be the most complete game ever.
Only a few technical issues, such as frame drop, are deductibles. However, it will not have a significant impact on play.

Also the dungeons are fun to complete and the game is good enough for you to keep coming back to compltet it.

Ninjeddie,28-06-2020,"It's a 9.5 but i'm rounding up. It's in my top 3 Zelda games, and i've spent more hours on it than any other Zelda game i've ever played. One of the only drawbacks is the lack of traditional dungeons. There's 4 sort-of dungeons, and really they are dungeons, but... you'll understand why they don't feel like a dungeon when you play them. They're not thematically different from one another, for one. Understandably, they couldn't do much in the way of varying creativity since the game is 100% open world, and you have to be able to play those dungeons at any given time you choose.
But I believe there HAS to be a way to have more creativity and have traditional dungeons that can also be played in any order. So it gets a mark down for that.

The weapons mechanic works perfectly as designed. You'll never run out of good weapons, the land is littered with them. So no fears on your weapons breaking eventually. Break them, the game will replenish them for you, you just have to go fetch them. What this does is that it incentivises you to re-explore areas where the weapons sleep, or find new places where others are yet to be discovered.
Without the breaking mechanic you would never have a want or desire or need to explore new areas and mini-dungeons. You'd be comfortable with that one Super-power weapon carrying you through the whole game if it never broke. So there's a good reason.
That said.
Even though it worked as intended and it DID enhance my enjoyment after all...
I still don't prefer this.
I would like a different incentive to explore dungeons other than ""cuz my swords keep breaking.""
The incentives should be how cool certain weapons are, materials that enhance your weapons, literally anything that's craftsmanship related. There is a problem with this in that it breaks the game's difficulty into making it easy if you keep your weapons forever and you keep enhancing it through craft, but games like Skyrim have shown ways to deal with that, a game that BotW shares many things in common with already. Another incentive is simply obtaining many different ways of achieving the same goals for the sake of it just being cool. Magic as another weapon would've been cool, which is a game mechanic that is sorely missed in recent Zelda games. Ocarina used to employ magic, like expelling walls of fire. So the point is, while the weapon-breaking mechanic works, and did enhance my gameplay... I strongly prefer alternatives and it never ever feels good seeing your weapons break. It sucks.
.
Story is good. This is one of the best incarnations of the Princess. Top 2? She doesn't top Ocarina's Zelda. It's hard to top a character whose alter-ego is a bad-ass ninja that was later split into two separate selectable characters of the same person in Smash Bros. But BotW's Zelda has such personality, and is fleshed out more in this game. She's very proactive in her scenes.
But the story overall is sparse. Needs improvement for the next installment.

But everything else is sublime. The exploration, discovery, the survival element... the food mechanic, the scavenging... the glorious difficulty... and the sandbox playground of playing things however you want is liberating. You can even solve puzzles in many ways that weren't even intended. You can get really creative with thinking outside the box to solve them. For example: A movable labyrinth where you guide a ball through the maze in order to find the exit. OR.... force the physics to launch the ball in the air, flip the labyrinth upside down to where its underside is all a flat plane, and catch the ball on that side, then simply slide it off into the designated goal. That's just fun feeling so clever because you cheated the system. And that's just a sample.

This game gets your brain on and in the zone. It's also peaceful and relaxing. The vistas are beautiful, and you feel like you're really out in the wild, braving the elements.
While it's not the same traditional experience of previous Zeldas where its linearity allowed for a more tailored story-centric experience, it allows for absolute freedom to go wherever you want to go whenever you want, and it eliminates the problems of ""getting stuck"" in a game since you can simply move on somewhere else. Overall, as someone who'se very critical of my Zeldas, this is one of the best Zelda games ever made and maybe my 3rd or 2nd favorite.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

KMC98,23-06-2020,"This game sets itself apart from any Zelda game before it, creating a very unique gameplay style that is very much welcome. The sense of exploration sets the game far ahead of any other Zelda game in its lack of linearity, and the dungeons/bosses are so well designed that those from many previous games feel clunky in comparison. The art style, too, is commendable; BOTW is in my opinion the most visually appealing Zelda game even in handheld mode. Finally, the length of the whole experience helps BOTW rather than hurts it since the world never feels boring and there is always so much to do. It takes an incredibly long time to run out of shrines to solve or side quests to hammer away at, and the addictive gameplay and near-infinite possibilities give BOTW excellent replayability.

However, where the game falls short is a poor technical direction (the ever present white fog filter is an eye-sore) and a refusal to use anything more than a very few set of assets to construct anything truly unique outside of the 5 main setpieces is a giant blight on an open-world game. Additionally, there are only two good English voice actors in this game, the rest sound like they where pulled off the street.

Mjcarrillo96,07-04-2021,"Took me two whole years to beat this game because I simply didn't want it to end. It's the very definition of a system-seller game, and I couldn't imagine a better console to play it on. My 60+ hours were spent on the TV, lying in bed, on my breaks at work, on an airplane... Wherever I was, I always felt at peace with the world they gave me to discover.

I love the cell-shaded graphics. Like most other Zelda entries, I think the art style will prove to be timeless and never really look dated. The open-world ""choose your own order"" was such a fantastic change in the formula that I'm very close to saying this is the best Legend of Zelda game. It has the full scope of the original NES game but with the mechanics of later entries, and some of the best storytelling the franchise has ever had. The only thing that really holds it back as my favorite entry, is that the bosses felt too easy and didn't require enough strategy. In fact, my favorite aspect of the previous Zelda games was aquiring new items and using them in specific ways to defeat the bosses. Breath of the Wild definitely compensates for this by having updated combat, a larger arsenal of breakable weapons, and the slate abilities, and it's more than rewarding in the context of the game. Breakable weapons and shields was a bit annoying at first, but I think it made the experience more strategic, and the game would've been far too easy if they didn't break. I did make it my goal to get the rechargable Master Sword as soon as possible, so that could be why I'm easier on the mechanic than others. But it consequently hinders the boss battles, which feel more like a family-friendly Dark Souls that require nothing more than patience and well-placed dodges, as opposed to the classic Zelda bosses that felt more like solving an evolving puzzle.

That was my only disappointment though. The exploration reached an unprecedented height. The story was grim and somber, but also contemplative and occasionally triumphant. The music is beautifully understated; a pretty rare treat when most games have such bombastic scores. Every character and location shined drastically in their own way. It was a joy to lose myself in Hyrule again, and I can't wait to return for Breath of the Wild 2.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Also, sometimes the game feels empty. You don’t notice it the first time, but it’s obvious if you have more than 200-220 hours played.

Shend,24-01-2023,"This game is a masterpiece. I don't have to say much, because we already know this. It's not the best in any particular category, its just good and sometimes even great in realms like combat, enemies and level design, etc., but this game is best in one thing: Exploration.

There is no game that is more fun to explore. To just get lost in the world. There are so many options for traversal, and so many unique locations with so much to discover. I love how the game lets you do whatever you want. It doesn't force you in any direction, or gate off access to some locations with overpowered enemies. Once you beat the tutorial, the game just says ""go"". And that's what you do.

If you play games for story, this might not be your style. If you play games for varied and diverse boss and dungeon design, like previous games in the series had, then this might not be for you. But if you play games for the sense of adventure, for the feeling of pioneering a journey through an unforgettable world, if you've ever wanted to travel a vast and beautiful kingdom on your own; if you've EVER wanted to go on an adventure, there's no game that does it better than this.

But once it klicks... there are no boundaries left and it pays off. If you look on youtube you get the feeling the game can handle every insane idea people come up with about what can be done in it.

Azaiku,25-11-2021,"I never thought I'd feel that way again. And then Breath of the Wild changed all that.
I finally put my controller down a few weeks ago after spending nearly 150 hours in this vibrant world. I've never come close to taking that much time in a single playthrough of any game, and by the end I felt satisfied while still wanting more. This was a special experience, and I took my time to soak it all in. What makes this game so amazing?

It gave me the same feeling of exploration and wonder that the original showed me back in 1988.

From the moment you first step into this world, you realize its something special. By the time you leave the plateau, it starts to sink in how amazing this interpretation of Hyrule is. This is a living, breathing world full of places to explore, discoveries to be made and adventures to be experienced.

It just felt...right.

And I think the key is the amount of detail and love the developers put into this product. Metal weapons attract lightning, people run indoors when it starts to rain, wooden objects start on fire, enemies get angry if you take their weapons. If you think something might work, give it a try and it probably will. This world feels like a playground, rather than a series of levels. You can explore endlessly and avoid the main quest, or you can go straight to the ending if you want. Hyrule castle is viewable from nearly every point on the map, serving as constant reminder of your final goal.

And I put off the final battle until I felt I was ready. The thing is, I still have nearly 40 shrines to find and beat. This is a game I'll pick up again when all the DLC has been released, and I'll pick it up again in a year or two to run through it again.

A nivel artístico y gráfico es muy bonito y los personajes igual. La BSO también es muy buena. Mi problema es el resto. La historia no es que esté muy allá, siendo los puntos fuertes las mazmorras de las bestias y consiguiendo los poderes para avanzar en la historia. Otro punto negativo es que puedas ir a por el jefe final desde el comienzo, lo que es un suicidio, pero se puede hacer, prefiero algo más guiado y lineal que te suelten en un mundo abierto y apañate tú como puedas. Otro tema es que las armas se rompan. Lo siento, no puedo con eso. Entiendo que las armas más endebles se destruyan, pero las espadas más duras y útiles que también se rompan me parece una estupidez. En cuanto a las secundarias, son las típicas que o las haces con guía o no las encuentras al igual que con algunas soluciones de los templos donde consigues corazones y resistencia. Otro punto negativo que le veo es el combate, muy simple y aburrido que consiste en salto, esquive y golpear y encima añade que se te rompa el arma. No lo aguanto.

Wwilliams23,06-11-2020,"I played and beat BOTW, and as a lifelong Zelda fan, I must say, it's one of the best, but not the best. That title, in my opinion, belongs to The Wind Waker, closely followed by Ocarina of Time. This new open world approach has its pros and cons. On the good side, it's massive, and discovering towns and enemies is always fun. On the bad side, it can feel empty and bland at times. That's understandable given the Switch hardware. But then again, look at Witcher 3 on Switch. The weapon breaking doesn't strike my fancy although many players seem to like it. The story is quite weak compared to games past, in my opinion. Sure, we get voice acting, but it's still lacks the narrative punch of games like Skyward Sword or Wind Waker. I also found the final boss to be a bit unsatisfying. The side missions were better than the main story, in my eyes. I also would have liked a post-game, because once you beat it, you just kind of ""restart"" the final section. Despite its glaring flaws, it still stands as a solid Zelda game, just not the revolutionary one many claim it to be.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Pbesfamille,02-02-2021,"This game is amazing.
The art, character design and atmosphere are beautiful. The game mechanics are well designed and quite simple; that together with the freedom that the game gives from almost the beginning leads to one being able to solve problems or win battles in many different ways. And when one becomes better acquainted with these mechanics and finds himself in situations that require ingenuity, the level design supports the player in finding their own way to achieve their goal. Thanks to this, one feels that he is always progressing and that he has an impact in the open world.
I've never played a Zelda title before, so I can't tell if they made things like the camera, combat system, or puzzles better or worse. But this game, by itself, seems to me to handle them very well overall. Because the camera doesn't work very well in close quarters, combat can get monotonous (hit, shield, dodge in their attack, hit) and kolog puzzles become easy and repetitive. But the game does not have many closed places, it changes enemies to avoid being repetitive and the puzzles are totally optional in case one wants more saddlebag space. This is why I think the designers knew about these annoyances when playing, and designed the game well so that they do not become major annoyances.
It is true that some areas of the game lower the FPS a lot, but it's a Switch and I use it not for the graphics or the speed, but for the games. And I would say that Zelda Breath of the Wild is so good, it's worth buying the console to experience it.

Is it absolutely perfect? No, but no game is. It is, however, a masterpiece. It reinvents the legendary Zelda franchise in a way that only Ocarina of Time has done before - and it does so beautifully.

Positives:
- Graphics are amazing. This really is a beautiful game.
- Greatest game ever made with exploration in mind
- Fun shrines and puzzles (though not particularly hard)
- Great combat
- Gameplay
- The stamina bar might be the greatest addition to the game since 3D. It allows you to gradually explore the world while keeping the sense of freedom intact from first minutes to the last.

Negatives
- Great music, but there's definitely too little of it.
- Tedious (but kind of fun) cooking system. QOL changes would be appreciated.
- Weapon durability. I get the system, and I don't absolutely hate it, because it teaches you to value your gear in a way that you wouldn't otherwise - but they could at least double the durability and keep that same sense of joy whenever you find a new (good) weapon.
- The ending was definitely lackluster. I was intrigued the entire game, which is why the ending left me feeling a bit unsatisfied.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Awanka,07-08-2022,"I finally got around to playing this legendary game and... it's pretty good, with some caveats. BOTW brings a lot of revolutionary concepts to the table. This like difficult terrain traversal, a large open world, and high environment interactivity with fires that can spread to anything flammable, and rain that can make surfaces slippery. As a whole though, for all the progress that this game has made, it also takes quite a few steps back. BOTW actually felt too open-ended for this player. The beauty of a Zelda game is the simplicity of storyline and gameplay. Zelda is a streamlined experience of tight gameplay, meaningful exploration, and minimal narrative to get in the way. It's an exercise in minimalism, and the player is always exploring, kicking ass, or moving to the next dungeon. Breath of the Wild has far more complexity than a typical Zelda game, and that's good and bad. BOTW has a lot of meandering around wondering what you're supposed to be doing next, or how to fulfil an obscure question condition, or how to solve an obnoxious puzzle in a shrine. A lot of times I was semi-bored.

An example of complexity is cooking food which is a pain in the butt. There are so many combinations, and it's hard to figure out what's optimal, or even remember how you cooked something earlier because recipes aren't stored anywhere. It's that needless complexity again.

Also this game is really wordy. The other thing I loved about Zelda is that there are few npcs, and they barely talk. BOTW has tons more people, and they won't shut up. You can't tell what is important information, and what's mindless npc dialog. I feel like this is another step backwards for the franchise.

El mecanismo de las mini mazmorras es bastante original para conseguir resistencia y corazones me sorprendió bastante este viniendo de la saga Zelda la cual en su mayoría se obtiene en mazmorras obligatorias y exploración del mapa profundamente en bastante inmersivo en ese aspecto y nada mas que decir el juego tiene su 10/10 muy merecido y sinceramente un juego hecho con amor y dedicación porque desarrollar un mundo así de vivo debe llevar un trabajo muy fuerte y constante.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

For example the seemingly empty world. While the land of Hyrule was destroyed 100 years before the events of the game. Villages could've rebuilt themselves. However it is still a brilliant game , with many things to do and collect. Not to mention that you can just mess around and you might find something nice like the games 120 shrines (12 more including DLC). Or 900 korok puzzles .

MrPajamas,23-02-2021,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild was my first game on Switch. After all, why not, when she has such praise and even won the game of the year. The game has a great atmosphere with beautiful graphics. I'm really smacking in front of the developers here, because they played perfectly with the graphics to make the game look good, even though it runs on a handheld console. In addition to graphics, I was also pleasantly surprised by the controls, which are luxuriously used by the Switches console itself. The story is great. You will change items for our main character Link during the game, but you will not upgrade it, as I am used to with other RPGs. When I have bitten the upgrades, you are not getting through a new level here, but across the fulfillment of various puzzles, which are quite simple at the beginning, but at the end they can be quite annoying. For fulfilling these puzzles, you then get the so-called Spirit Orbs, which you then use for the improvement itself, whether HP or stamina. But you don't just get it and you have to find such an illuminated stone that will give you the opportunity to replace these Spirit Orbs. What's magical about the game is that it still seems to force you to discover something. You, as a player, don't know much about it from the beginning and you won't actually find out anything as you progress through the game, but you have to figure it out yourself. Let's say you can cook, but the game won't tell you what ingredients to use, so you have to experiment yourself. This can be quite frustrating at first when you use your heavily fried food, which you cooked badly in the final and thus wasted your items. But other times, you can get the perfect feeling that you've mixed such a perfect blend that will give you a few HP with some time bonus in the form of resistance to fire, winter or a moment of increased HP. I was quite frozen that our main protagonist did not speak, and not only him. Overall, there is text all the time and the characters make a sound here and there, but otherwise they are silent. I understand that it's a kind of style of play, but for me personally, it wouldn't hurt to throw some dubbing in such a perfect RPG so that the game can draw you even more into the story. Overall, the absence of dubbing is, in my opinion, the biggest minus of the game. Otherwise, it's a great game that could convince you to try the Nintendo Switch and I, as a long opponent of the Switch with words, it's just a portable console without performance, I changed my mind.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

One frustrating thing I would like to mention is that when attacking or running from enemies I find the joystick on my joycon is easily pushed in and I find myself now crawling on the ground with an enemy closing in, or already beating me to smithereens. I’ve learned to finesse the joystick a bit more over time, but it distracts me from the gameplay at times, and other times I still end up crawling on accident. I would still give this game a 10. But, it may be better played with a different controller, maybe the pro controller(I don’t have one), and this may want to be considered before buying the game, especially if you mash hard on your joystick.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

- Graphics, for Nintendo Switch looks good, not a revolution in graphics, but not so bad.

Cons of the game:
- The plot, well, it is too primitive, a typical story ""SAVE THE PRINCESS"".
- Voice acting, it is very little, given that the cutscenes have excellent voice acting.
- FPS drawdowns, although they are few, are very few, but when they appear, they hurt the eyes very much.

There’s so much to do, the graphics are unbelievable, and the sheer content in this game makes it one of the best games ever. I was starting to loose passion for it, but that was instantly reignited after I purchased the DLC. The DLC is incredible, and if you liked the game for the lore, then this is a must have. Even without the DLC however, it’s replay-ability is insane. Even if this game could only be played one time, I would still make the purchase in a heartbeat. There’s so much to do in one save file, let alone multiple. There’s many ways to play the game and you can challenge yourself with infinite new ways to play the game. Maybe you want to do a shrine-less run, or not beat any of the Divine Beasts, great. If the game is too easy for you, try out Master Mode where it becomes insanely difficult.

También, algo en lo que mucha gente ha visto una falla ha sido en la historia, ya que esta es corta. Yo, sin embargo, si es cierto que la noté corta pero no lo suficiente como para no disfrutar del juego, de echo, hizo todo lo contrario, me gusto y me hizo disfrutar mucho más del juego.

Kaan514,10-11-2020,"First of all this game is a masterpiece. The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild showed to game industry that you do not need to have 4K resolution or real looking graphics to do a good game.

Story Telling
The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild story telling is way different than AAA games that you have played. There is not that much cut scene is involved but the ones are in the game are connecting you to the game. I defeated the Ganon after 175+ hours of play because I did not wanted to finish time game. I can tell you like this. You know when you like one book or the TV series so much that you do not want to watch the last episode or read the last chapter this game made me feel like that instead of the other games and I am looking for sequel games for the Zelda franchises.

Gameplay and Open World
I wanted to merge these two things because the gameplay in the Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is really connected to the open world elements to. In the open world you can go anywhere you want just from the beginning of the game. Zelda just leaves you free to explore its unique world just from the beginning. You can find bunch of different biomes, towns and even forbiden places. There is weather conditions happens during your journey. Now I heard you are asking how is this related with the gameplay? Well you can climb anywhere you want at the open world. You can use your paraglider to glide where ever you would like. On top of that you can use your 4 types of runes to interact with the world too. You can freeze your enemies. You can stop the time for some objects. I will not tell you all the runes.

Sparky__,17-11-2020,"A game that’s in development is about to finish and the launch of Nintendo’s newest console is around the corner and with that the face of the switch, the game that would change an entire series as a whole.

This game defined and brought a new light to the entire open world genre and took a turn for the greater for the Legend of Zelda series bringing in new people and possibly reviving it in some aspects.

Bringing new to old with the original Zelda premise into the open world genre as it did with the original game that introduced the series into a new dimension literally, The legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. It originally was the game to change the industry for 3D games and set an example for other games to come. Bringing the series into an open setting and further defining the beauty of what the Switch or even a handheld console can do and giving players the freedom to do whatever they want set in a loose story which gives players another freedom which most open worlds don’t have which is a flexible story that you get to choose how to play it. This also sets a divide and middle ground between the casual and professional players making it a game that can be played by anyone.

The soundtrack and atmosphere really bring a lot to the game with it being a light but sometimes hard hitting OST and a natural and wild atmosphere that really goes well with the idea of the Kingdom of Hyrule being abandoned and destroyed, giving you the player to explore it and defeat the evil that will end the world in due time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Cidor,01-02-2021,"Игру проходил 3 раза - в неё постоянно хочется вернуться, потому что аналогов до сих пор нет, хотя некоторые уже пытались скопировать её, например, immortal fenix rising или genshin impact, но это всё-равно далеко не то. Достоинства:
1) Интересные механики;
2) Огромный открытый мир и полная свобода действий!
3) Прекрасная, запоминающаяся музыка;
4) Атмосфера;
5) Игра очень реалистичная, не в плане графики, а в плане физики: здесь вода тушит огонь, а не как в horizon), против ветра тебе тяжело лететь, а по направлению ветра наоборот, с персонажа капают капли воды, если он вылез из какого-нибудь водоёма, вы можете срубить деревья, траву или сжечь еë, в общем, всë что работает в реальной жизни, с 90% вероятностью сработает и здесь, и не зря Зельду сравнивают с рдр2 в плане деталей;
6) Святилища сделаны достаточно интересно, большинство из них не похожи друг на друга (если отбросить испытание силы) и помогают разобраться в механиках игры;
7) Кто-то скажет, что игра выглядит как пастген, а я скажу, что это одна из самых красивых игр - благодаря своему визуальному стилю она сохранится на долгие годы, реалистичная же графика устарела бы спустя несколько лет, да и просто смотреть на леса, горы, озёра - на природу в целом, одно удовольствие.
Недостатки:
1) Поначалу, когда мы покидаем начальную локацию, игра может показаться хардкорной, ведь какой-нибудь каменный глыбник может убить с одного удара, даже если ты в броне. Однако, после часов 20-30, когда ты изучил механики боя, у тебя полно еды, которая не только полностью отхилит тебя, но и даст дополнительные сердца, игра станет очень лёгкой, и боссы будут отлетать от тебя спустя минуту;
2) Дополнительные задания в игре, в большинстве случаев никакие. Да, игра не РПГ, а адвенчура, но всё-таки.
3) На полную озвучку то ли Nintendo поскупились, то ли посчитали это не нужным, что отчасти верно, ибо диалоги - это буквально пара строчек, но видеть полную озвучку было бы приятнее.
Я бы хотел дать игре и 10/10, но по мне такой игры просто не существует, ибо это что-то идеальное или очень близко к идеальному, а в Зельде всё-таки есть косяки. В общем, над игрой работали очень долго, и результат того стоил! Breath of the wild стала самой продаваемой игрой в серии, получила кучу наград, в том числе и игра года, да и просто завоевала огромную любовь у игроков. Очень надеюсь, что уже сиквел не только привнесёт новые хорошие механики и идеи, но и исправит старые недочёты.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

There's plenty to do, enough to play for a hundreds hours. The story isn't the greatest but its still interesting and makes you want to know more. The Strongest point of the game is the freedom it gives you not just in exploration but in puzzle solving there are so many ways to solve each puzzle, some I never even thought about until I saw someone else doing it .

Creo que por lo que no le doy un 10 es porque aunque el combate es divertido y adictivo, no me acabo de acostumbrar al sistema de esquive:

1.- Tienes que fijar forzosamente a un enemigo para esquivar.
2.- El fijar a un enemigo requiere dejar presionado un botón (No me gusta para nada).
3.- El esquive se siente muy limitado a menos que realices un esquive perfecto, cosa que es algo complicada.

Me hubiera gustado un sistema de esquive más tradicional, es decir, que dependiera de un botón y que realmente fuera efectivo.

Pero eso no quiere decir que el juego sea malo ni mucho menos, creo que es uno de los mejores juegos que he probado y uno de los mejores del género. 9/10",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

- There is SO MUCH content packed into this game that I get easily distracted because why call your Mount when the next cool thing is a jog's distance away?

There are hundreds of Korok seeds to collect, each having a mini puzzle or placed in a hard-to-reach area. All four of the divine beasts are incredibly fun and creative as well, each having unique gimmicks and boss fights.

Mrpinguini,13-12-2020,"Nintendo managed to move the Zelda series forward without sacrificing the soul of the saga, a game that can be enjoyed by hardcore fans and newcomers. Exploration is the core of the game: the sense of adventure, the feeling of freedom and the curiosity for the unexplored drive the player wandering from start to finish. Visually stunning, breathtaking landscapes. Cons: A world without boundaries comes with a cost: every area has to be accessible to the player from the beginning, hence there is no real curve of difficulty or progression throughout the game (expect maybe for the first 5/10 hours when you are still getting familiar with the mechanics). Landscapes are beautiful and diverse but the game recycle a lot of assets and situations: you will find the same enemies throughout the world, the same architecture and aesthetic for shrines and ""dungeons"", same korok puzzles ecc. That being said, the game is enjoyable for dozens of hours even for people who usually dislike dispersive worlds. I prefer games with a tight focus, quality over quantity but i found myself spending over 100 hours with this game. Breath of the wild is an extraordinary game, there is a lot of space for improvement (combat system, inventory management, dungeons ecc.) and that's what keeps me excited for the sequel.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Nor-Gamer,15-12-2020,"This game is well made. I have heard this game's map is big as Kyoto in Japan. The game's fun to explore, and it's very fun with the mechanics.

Story:
It's about a boy named Link that has been sleeping for the past 100 years. He must save the Hyrule Kingdom and the princess Zelda who is trapped there. Calamiity Ganon made of malice of evil; has taken over Hyrule castle and soon will take over the world.

While Link need to talk with The King of Hyrule: The last Leader of Hyrule. As he must also talk to Mipha and befree the divine beasts wich is selected by four Champions that is in control of the Calamity Ganon.

Content:
As the game goes, you can freely explore the world of Hyrule and visit the Shrines in the game of puzzles and as reward: a Sprit Orb. The Spirit Orbs can you offer to the statues of the Goddes and in return of selected of an extra heart container or a extended stamina wheel wich you decides.

There are also three types or quests in the game: ""Main Quests"" is where you follow the story and other main content, ""Requests"" where you do task for the people (such as searching for something) and ""Srhine Quests"" where you do quests that make some hidden shrines appear.

Gameplay:
There are monsters spread all over that wants to take you down. Of course you need wepons. You can find meele wepons from a branch to a sword that's strong and able to shoot light of it. The wepons, bows and sheilds break and you need to hunt for more wepons. Many monsters are carrying wepons already in their hands you can just take from. Chests, rewards and lucky finding will you find wepons, bows, arrows and shield as well.

You can also male a fireplace and camp for the night and also day, cook up some recipes, dicover new combats and much more!

The main story is enhanced by a bunch of great side quests and detailed environment that told us more about the history of this world and take the player on a journey.

The gameplay is on point, but I sadly need to take away one point for the debatable way the item's durability is handled, because of the very poor textures of the game and its permanent fog effect. Yes the game looks great and the fact it's working on such a tiny handled device is mysterious to me, but it does not change a thing about the lived experience.

The beauty of this version of Hyrule that Nintendo has created is the most incredible yet, with endless hours of exploration to discover things that you had no idea were there. As a long time Nintendo fan (even beginning my own adventure on the N64 version of Ocarina of Time), I am extremely happy to say that Nintendo killed it on this one. Some may not be accustomed to the new combat system introduced, but I believe that this adds a degree of difficulty not yet before seen in a Zelda game, and it continually makes you explore areas for new weapons that are needed. There is always something to do in this game, and even after completing the main story (which has hundreds of ways to get to that point in time) you’ll never be left with nothing to do.

GrapesToHarvest,20-12-2020,"I came at this game being lukewarm towards both zelda as a franchise and open world games. Zelda obviously was a staple of early gaming for me on the original nintendo + super nintendo with link to the past. but zelda ocarina of time, a game that many consider the greatest of all time, didn't do it for me on nearly the same level that mario 64 did as a kid.

After playing the game and DLC for over 200 hours I can say confidently it was the best game of the generation and one of the best i've ever played. I rank it above monster titles like RDR2, GOW, Mario Odyssey, GOT and Spiderman PS4.

What makes the game so good to me is the world design, the inherent freedom of the game, the fun factor of simple exploration/travel, the art and style, the amount of content, and the superb balance on every level of the game (sound design / visual / game play / story / exploration),

For some of the aspects I mentioned above, BOTW isn't the best to do it. But where it separates itself is in traversing its' open world. Open world games often dont master making the world fun to travel, and then expect you to travel across it. They might make the world beautiful (which BOTW did as well in a very unique cell-shaded way), they'll give you many missions and quests (BOTW has some, but not as many as some of its' peers), but ultimately it feels like a chore because the travel mechanics and exploration game play become tedious. BOTW imo does this better than any other game. The climb mechanic, the ability to float, snowboard, using a horse, in the DLC having a motorcycle etc, coupled with the insane abundance of secrets and items to collect makes it never feel dull. Now, the travel isn't perfect, particularly being interrupted in an epic climb by rain can be really annoying, but that is minor.

The games I mentioned above are all superior to BOTW in one way or another. RDR2 is on an entirely different level from a story capacity. GOT and Spiderman absolutely obliterate BOTW on the fighting mechanics. Odyssey has a ridiculous fun factor second to none. But Zelda has the best balance of all of these things.

The world of BOTW inspires a child-like wonder and seems to be crafted with an appreciation for the simplicity of nature. It reminds you of a simpler more fun time in video games and life in general. If you haven't played this game you are truly doing yourself a disservice.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

To me, this game was a game changer (or you could say ‘this game changed the perspective I had on those open world games) because the game gives you a number of fun activities including entering plenty of dungeons, collecting special items and defeating the boss while receiving useful weapons and helpful tips letting players know where the glowing spots that would make Gannon weak are.

So I’ll just say this. If you’ve never played a Zelda game, you don’t need to, to enjoy this game. It is the least “Zelda” a Zelda game has ever been. Giving this game a play is one of the best gaming decisions you can make. It really is one of the greatest games of all time, with one of the largest, most immersive and expansive worlds a game has ever had. It’s really worth the time you’ll spend on it, which will be well over 100 hours.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
BeeSting1,01-01-2021,"Great game, if you like non-linearity.

Pros:
- vast open world
- items break. Throwing a sword thats about to break at the enemy feels good
- characters are interesting, very zelda-esque
- music is great
- parry system brings more skill to the table
- can approach many situations in different ways

Cons:
- zelda cutscenes need to be accessible without having to search the world. They are important to the story.
- maybe a bit too non-linear
- no return of classic items like hook shot.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

iCampoRamil,02-04-2021,"Todo lo que hace lo hace bien, a pesar de que te pueda gustar más o menos, o de que se encage en tu estilo.
Empezamos con un mundo bien amplio, que promete muchísimo, sobre todo si te gustan los juegos de exploración y tirarte horas y horas explorando, este es tu juego, y encima está bien gestionado, es de los mejores mundos abiertos que he jugado, hay cosas por todos lados, una gozada.
Me gusta mucho el tema de los recuerdos, cinemáticas que te vas encontrando por todo el mapa para avivar un poco el lore y la memoria de Link.
Eso sí, hay algunas misiones que son cansinas hasta decir basta, las típicas misiones que hay en todos los juegos que, si las hubiesen omitido, aunque entiendo que son necesarias, el juego sería de 10.
De lo mejor que tiene es la mecánica de la escalada, se puede ir a cualquier sitio escalando, eso es una gozada y un plus para el mundo abierto.
Quizás se te pueda hacer confuso, si no estás acostumbrado a este tipo de juegos, no saber a dónde ir, ni que hacer ahora, porque el juego te da libertad plena, lo único que tienes que hacer es acabar con Ganon, y listo.
Al final se acaba haciendo, aunque te acostumbras, un poco pesado el tema de que se vaya rompiendo todo, el tema del frío, etc., pero lo dicho, te acostumbras, y con los trajes, se va solucionando.
Los bosses en general me parecieron bastante sencillos para lo que nos tiene acostumbrados la saga, quizás es una de las mayores pegas que le pongo, te revienta tanto un npc cualquier de por ahí que Gaonon.
Lo dicho, lo mejor que tiene es el mundo abierto, todos los secretos que esconde, y todo el tema de mazmorras y puzzles que son una genialidad.
Por decir algo malo, este juego debería estar en PC, porque la Switch no puede a veces con él, sobre todo en el Bosque Kolog, la historia quizás sea demasiado sencilla para un juego de este calibre, y los enemigos, en especial los bosses, quizás se hagan sencillos de más.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Needless to say, I spent my quarantine exploring the vast world of Hyrule, it's creatures, it's puzzles and it's story. Whilst I had dipped into previous titles such as Twilight Princess and A Link Between Worlds, this was the first Zelda game I had become gripped into and finished. And boy, did it grip me tight.

From it's combat, gorgeous visuals to it's subtle symbolism and story-telling, I am not exaggerating when I say this game has changed my life. It has opened my eyes to a rich history of Zelda, introduced me to the warriors genre with Age of Calamity amongst other things.

For impression, the art style is pretty comfortable that just like a Studio Ghibli anime into zelda which is a very incredible concept. Also, for the gameplay that is interesting, the enemies type is small but they mixing other element make it be good. However, every one may think this games have bad graphis at switch and will u, the game experience with 960p 30fps and the game instruction is lack but I still think these did not affect the whole game experience because I paly this game just feel enjoy when every time open the game there is interesting attract me to explore this world so it make me feel a masterpiece is not just 3A project which can make you feel like your first meet videogame in childhood",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Hmokhmok,21-03-2022,"The legend of zelda breath of the wild is the game that was able to innovate open world and live up to what an open world really means. Where you can be anything. The game Starts out with the best tutorials I have seen teaching me the basics of the game while giving me freedom to approach a challenge anyway I want without zelda telling me to not do this instead she just watch me die repeatedly. But when I finally overcome a difficult problem. It give me this sense of satisfaction as if I actually beat it with my smol brain of mine. After the tutorial I realize iam just literally 3percent done with the game with a large and dense open world . Compare to most open world botw is more serene and lay back. It's just a relaxing journey where climbing became a fun game mechanic.The music makes the environment of villages more peaceful especially the hateno village theme and the stables theme. These music makes the village feel alive with children running around and people talking. God I love the visiting the villages.The art direction also plays a major role and makes the village just so beautiful even on the swtiches underpowered hardware. Who ever makes the box art for botw needs a raise with his/her stunning art work. The combat is just like your average zelda combat its good but not dark souls good . just your basic dodge perfect parry combat with breakable weapons.

ksk_2606,21-01-2021,An amazing game! Zelda Breath of the wild invented a new genre with its perfect gameplay!,10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
DonnieTrump,27-01-2021,"The last couple of weeks I played Breath of the Wild extensively and I was living and breathing (pun intended) Zelda until I finally saved the land of Hyrule. This is a landmark in gaming history, a masterpiece and when people say this is the best game of the last decade I'm inclined to believe them. For me however it has become a unique journey in an immersive world, but as it sometimes goes with journeys, not everything goes as smoothly as you like. I'm not going to discuss the spectacular open world, fantastic physics engine, the inventive puzzles in the shrines or the amazing Divine Beasts. Plenty of people have already done that and probably in a better way I ever could. Instead I want to discuss - and what I've rarely seen in other reviews - is the experience curve. Because Breath of the Wild is an experience I've never experienced before, both in a good way, but also with a plethora of inconveniences.

The game is truly open world and the masked tutorial in the beginning is somewhat friendly for the player, but after this part the world of Hyrule can become a very scary place. Every enemy is a potential death threat and enemies will find you. With a scarcity in resources the game resembles Resident Evil in more ways than one. When Nintendo said they have rethought what a Zelda game is they weren't kidding. The questionable mechanic that weapons break in an instant makes the game hard, but for all the wrong reasons. The first few hours in the game were not enjoyable for me and probably neither for the majority of other players I guess. It's only when I have resolved a number of shines, have collected a respectable number of weapons, increased my heart count and possess a number of potions that the game really shines.

And shine it does! Exploring this seemingless organic world is maybe the greatest strength of this game. I have visited several outskirts on earth and Breath of the World equals that experience. I've never thought this was possible in a game. The game really unveils itself when I start to visit the different peoples and Divine Beasts. The moment I visit Zora's Domain is a magical moment where everything comes together and you only encounter a handful of times in your gaming career. And Breath of the Wild is the proud owner of such a moment. It's on this moment that euphory starts to kick in and in my brain I already have concluded this is the best game ever. However, the more I explore this imaginative world of Hyrule I'm starting to discover the game mechanics, the somewhat repetitive structure of shrines and Divine Beasts and the game loses its magical touch.

The plenty of minor inconveniences that are available in the game start to annoy me. Not able to climb when it rains is a nuisance, the swimming is way too slow, the voice acting is sometimes of a questionable level and the slow commutes between locations can be a hassle. I'm no longer in love with this game. As in each relationship the biochemistry of love doesn't last forever, but here the feeling of routine comes sooner than expected. The unanymous appreciation of an open world Zelda causes the gameplay to be unbalanced. Say what you want about the more linear adventures of Link, but they never felt unbalanced. Here it does. The beginning is maybe a tad too difficult, but after dozens of hours into the game the mainquest becomes too easy. The final battle with Ganon is a piece of cake compared to taking down a Lynel. I think the diversive Twilight Princess is the best Zelda game to this date because of the ingenious design of its dungeons and Breath of the Wild doesn't replace that experience. It's a very nice addition to that game, but no replacement.

There is plenty to talk about this game and that is what the internet still is doing. After four years major gaming websites such as IGN and Gamespot are still releasing articles and movies about this game. It's a testimony to the impact, power and greatness of this game. While I think this game is unbalanced, has a somewhat skewed experience curve and possesses plenty of minor inconveniences, it all pales in comparison in what this game has to offer. An unrivaled open world experience that is unique for every player that has set a new defintion not only for this genre, but gaming in general. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and a few games have already copied the structure of Breath of the Wild. This game is after four years still the darling of the games industry and I don't see this changing anytime soon.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Pretty good graphics. Thanks to the powerful engine, the game is realistic physics, for example: you can climb the rocks, mow the grass (it's very fun), realistic behavior of characters and so on.

6Maschine,01-02-2021,"After Skyward Sword my expectations for Breath of the Wild were non existent. I hated Skyward Sword and I was so unhappy with so many decisions Nintendo made. While other developers were innovating and evolving in terms of story telling, world size, graphics etc. Nintendo played with gimmicky controls that often felt clunky and unresponsive. Nintendo felt like a shell of its former self.

it is for all those reasons that I could not believe I was playing a Zelda game by Nintendo when I booted up Breath of the Wild and stepped out into the Plateau. It really felt like a breath of fresh air. The colors, the vastness, the beautiful piano, it all gave me a feeling I didn't feel in any Zelda game since Twilight Princess when it first released.
That feeling only grew stronger when I played the same scene again to show it to my girlfriend only to notice that now there were 2 birds flying by as if coded into the cut scene. The very first 5 Minutes already felt so alive.

I immediately loved the cooking and climbing mechanics of the game. There was always something to discover. Even the enemies were harder than usual for a Zelda game and I absolutely got my ass kicked when I tried the first camps.

I loved it. And the craziest part is, that this feeling never left me throughout the game. I never thought to myself ""ah... ok... that sucks"". No game is without its inconveniences but BotW makes more than up for it. For every ""that's ok I guess"" moment there were at least 3 ""holy **** that was awesome"" or ""They really thought of that ? Genius!"" moments.

The only thing that I really didn't like at all is the ending. I didn't like the last battle and I really hated that you cant continue after the ending. That was by far the worst experience for me.

Some would say there is no game deserving of a 10/10. Some would say that only those single few almost perfect classics - relics of an old time, are deserving of a perfect score. Others throw their 10/10 out like there's no tomorrow, even rating games like Pokemon or Fallout with a perfect score.

For me a 10/10 is a masterpiece. Something that's born only once every console generation. Although there are games of this generation I think are on par with BotW I truly believe that this game is deserving of a perfect 10/10. I will remember this game fondly not only when I think about the masterpieces I've played but also when I play other games. I will probably forever compare climbing mechanics and survival elements of other games to Breath of the Wild in the same way I compare dialogue options of RPGs to Mass Effect and Fallout: New Vegas or open world structure to The Witcher 3.

I hope Nintendo can keep up this level of quality for all future Zelda games and I am looking forward to BotW 2.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
yertre,03-02-2021,"What a pleasant surprise! I must say I'm really taken by this game. I bought a switch recently, and this is one of the best games of the decade.

Still not my favourite zelda, Link to The Past was more consistently great, but the nice thing about BoTW is that during its best moments, it really reaches heights no other game has reached before.

So there really isn't much to be said about the vast open world that hasn't been said. The title is suitable, the world really is alive and breathing. However, I want to address the 2 most controversial
things about the game: The story, and the weapon durability.

The story is admittedly quite lacking. There seems to have been a change to zelda's personality as a sort of nerdy, weird geek or something, and I actually think it was supposed to be endearing somehow. I'm having a hard time remembering much else of the story, so that sort of goes to show.

The weapon durability is there to encourage players to think creatively, but in my experience that was hardly needed. There really isn't much incentive to be creative as armour pretty much breaks the game. Only way to make botw's combat work is to have many self imposed restrictions, which is a bit unfortunate. However, when you can be creative, you can be REALLY creative. This video should suffice to prove my point (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EvbqxBUG_c). The weapon durability was a good idea somewhat poorly implemented.

In general, BoTW gives the player a huge amount of freedom, which is fantastic. However, that comes with its own downsides. The problem is that when you're climbing or skating, you have no real obstacles, and so are somewhat disengaged. The climbing is great and all, but it really can wear out it's welcome.

The game also holds your hand too much, the puzzles are rather easy, the bosses are a let down, but honestly, when you hold these against the pure joy of freedom and exploration this game offers you like no other, they are minor issues, flecks of dirt against a wonderful and vast whole.

A 10/10 wouldn't be fair of me, but this game has its moments where it can feel like one. If you enjoy exploration, you really owe it to yourself to play this. Highly recommended",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

This game is the first Zelda game I have played and my first opinions are great.

-Pros-

•This games visuals are stunning (For the switch at least) and I love the art style.
•The combat is really fun and challenging.
•The main gameplay mechanic is to just get creative with how you fight and move around and that's something that a lot of games don't have
•shrines are short and designed for people to be able to complete them on the go like on the bus or on a short car drive
•This game gives you the ability to go and fight the final boss with a twig which is something barely any games do.
•The world is full of... I don't know! I haven't finished the game.

-Cons-

Most of the cons are visual problems that don't effect the game too much though

•Textures are low resolution
•Things don't render from a distance (As to be expected for a switch game)
•Framerate is at 30 FPS and rarely drop to 20
•Story is mediocre at best and is also mostly made up of flashbacks.

Visuals-8/10

Story-6/10

Ratingss,18-12-2021,"This is a game that gives you that joy of figuring stuff out by yourself, and almost from the very beggining you can explore the world however you want even going straight to the last boss if you are a bad enough dude.

The game world reminded me of Shadow of the Colossus, just a little more lively.

The combat and bosses are easy but we cant forget Nintendo games are meant to be played by children.

I was really impressed by this game, Nintendo seems to still know how to make a good game when they try, too bad it isnt , oficially, released on PC.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
cfc1998,19-02-2021,"The best open world experience I had in a videogame. This game is almost perfect and its the definition of what an open world should be. You can go anywhere you want, explore freely every single piece of grass there is (and the map is pretty big), everywhere you go you discover something new and interesting. Also the music is very good and the fighting fun. Never played a Zelda game before but this was a mindblowing experience.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
MittensJa,19-02-2021,"Absolutely adored this game when it came out. I have been playing this series since Ocarina of Time on the gamecube collectors edition. I since then played almost every Zelda game baring Phantom hour glass and Minish cap.
This game adds such a fresh air to the series! From the very first step out the cave all the way to the finale it's engaging throughout. This game tackles one of the most difficult aspects of an open world game. Linearity and Interest. Being able to tackle any of the shrines in any order or literally attack the final boss in your underwear, or being able to solve a puzzle in 30 different ways then intended makes it so freeing. Exploring and discovering new foods, shrines, puzzles, enemies, and side quests was one of the most fun things I have ever done! This game would easily hit a 10/10 for me in my book.... Except for one glaring flaw..

The second playthrough... Everything I have just detailed is immediately squashed after completing the game and starting a new playthrough. The main draw, the mystery and discovery... It's gone. That first playthrough made me feel like a little kid again, that's not something I take lightly, not much can do that for me. I genuinely love this game.... But unlike with Majora's Mask. That second play through doesn't leave a lot to do. That's all there is at the end of the day.. And that's hard to realize it sucks to. It's so SO much to do... But when you break it down.... There is no replay value... I am hoping the sequel tackles this issue just like how Majora's Mask did with their side quests.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Poxoo69,20-02-2021,"El mejor exclusivo de Switch y de toda la generación.

Nos ponemos en la piel de Link, el cual despierta de un letargo de 100 años y emprende la misión de salvar al reino de Hyrule de las garras de Ganon.

Historia: la narrativa es el punto más flojo del videojuego, quizás el único. Nos cuentan la historia en forma de 12 recuerdos localizados en diferentes puntos del mapa de juego. Veo poco desarrollo en este aspecto, pero Zelda no suele destacar por la narrativa individual de cada juego. Lo realmente interesante es el Lore alrededor de la saga y la conexión entre las distintas líneas temporales.

Jugabilidad: La jugabilidad es sobresaliente, introduce muchos cambios respecto a las entregas tradicionales. Gran variedad de armas: lanzas, espadas, mandobles, hachas... Todas ellas se rompen, obligando al jugador a variar el arsenal continuamente en los primeros compases del juego. Después todos tenemos nuestra Tier List personal de armas y sabemos aprovisionarnos.

Gráficos: Este juego es un milagro, que ocurre cada cierto tiempo. Digo milagro porque siempre hay algún juego en todas las generaciones de consolas que nos parece imposible a priori que un hardware de esas características lo pueda mover. Zelda ofrece un gigantesco mundo abierto lleno de vida, está entre los 10 mapas más grandes de la historia de los videojuegos. Todo ello lo mueve con la posibilidad de jugar en modo dock a 900p 30 fps y modo portátil a 720p 30 fps. Personalmente, el rendimiento deja algo que desear, llegando a bajar de los 30 fps en algunas zonas del juego como el Bosque Kolog, que es la más notable en cuanto a bajada de rendimiento. Por lo demás, sobresaliente.

Duración: Completar la historia principal siendo un jugador medio en su primera run, entorno a las 20 horas. Pero este juego es mucho más que eso, la forma real de disfrutar esta obra maestra es explorar cada rincón de Hyrule y descubrir sus innumerables secretos. Eso nos puede llevar centenas de horas. En mi caso personal, he completado 3 partidas distintas, entre las 3 sumo más de 500 horas. Y lo peor de todo, ninguna de las tres las he completado al 100%, se me resiste buscar las 900 semillas kologs. Una run normal centrándose únicamente en la historia, recuerdos, bestias divinas y los 120 santuarios sobrepasa las 100 horas.

Banda Sonora: No es necesariamente mala, pero me parece de las más flojas de la saga. Pero todo ello es un gusto personal, no me considero un experto en la materia.

DLC: añaden contenido adicional al juego, pero salvo alguna excepción como el modo experto y el santuario de la espada los veo bastante pobres. También he de añadir la inclusión de algún objeto bastante interesante, como las bridas y arreos ancestrales y el teletransportador.

Conclusión: Juegazo IMPRESCINDIBLE. Seas o no fan de la saga, es una rotura de los cánones tradicionales y una vuelta a los orígenes, con un clara referencia en Zelda (1986).

Nota: 10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

FireZD,22-02-2021,"This game is clearly a 10/10 game, I will not go over what it does right, as that would take a while but I will say that if you are on the fence about this game, buy it. I had never played a Zelda game, nor an open world game but the game was pure bliss, however, it is not without flaws, the main one I found was the replayability, unless you enjoy messing around, the post-game content is lacking. Some other ones are the weapon system, I found it to be a bit to easy to break weapons but I did enjoy the variety each weapon had. The last one I want to go over are the shrines and divine beasts, all the shrines look the same, and it looks OK, I think it would benefit from a few other designs that are different depending on where you are in the world. The divine beasts I found boring to solve and they too look the same.

Overall fantastic game, would recommend.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Iggy41,03-03-2021,"Einfach nur unglaublich! Es ist und bleibt mein Lieblings-Spiel aller Zeiten und das wird sich auch niemals ändern. Es ist nicht nur das beste Switch-Spiel, sondern vor allem das beste Spiel aller Zeiten. Außerdem ist es meiner Meinung nach das beste Spiel der Reihe und ich meine, Zelda natürlich zurecht ist die beliebteste Spielereihe aller Zeiten. An alle die eine Switch ohne Botw(Breath of the wild) haben: Schämt euch! Man findet auf der ganzen Welt keine Top-Liste der besten Switch-Spiele ohne Botw auf Platz 1.
Doch wieso liebe ich dieses Spiel so sehr?
1. Die Musik ist unfassbar gut. Und das obwohl sie nicht von Koji Kondo ist. Das schafft sonst fast kein Nintendo-Spiel. Ich liebe das Main-Theme! Aber allein der Trailer des Spiels ist unübertrieben epischer als alle Trailer (auch von Filmen), die ich je gesehen habe.
2. Die Story und die Charaktere sind so interessant und genial! Die Story ist einfach nur herzzerreißend und so unfassbar nachvollziehbar. Man startet mit Link ohne jegliche Erinnerung in der postapokalyptischen Welt Hyrule und man erlangt langsam seine Erinnerungen zurück und erkundet die Welt. Die Charaktere sind einfach nur toll dargestellt. Die Entwicklung von Prinzessin Zelda ist super dargestellt. Die verschiedenen Dörfer und Völker sind auch witzig und interessant.
3. Die Freiheit ist einzigartig. Es gibt kein Spiel, das so ein Open-World-Game ist wie Botw. Es gibt keine unsichtbaren Wände. Du kannst überall hin, wo du hin willst. Du kannst in jedes Haus, was wirklich einzigartig ist, denn so ein Spiel gibt es sonst nicht. Kein Open-World-Game hat wirklich keine Grenzen, außer Botw.
4. Dann gibt es da noch die kleineren Unglaublichkeiten, die ich jetzt alle in einen Punkt packe. Es gibt 120 sogenannte Schreine, in denen man kleine Rätsel und Prüfungen absolviert, die jeweils 5-10 Minuten dauern und für die man auch eine Belohnung bekommt, die sich lohnt, wenn man alle schafft. Es gibt über 150 Sidequests, die zwar teilweise nervig sind, aber trotzdem viele Spielstunden füllen. Und dann sind da natürlich die 900 Krogs. Sie verstecken sich unter Steinen, auf Bäumen, in Teichen und vielen anderen Orten. Sie sind auch hilfreich, da man mit ihnen seine Waffentasche vergrößern kann, die Belohnung, die man kriegt, wenn man alle hat, ist aber lächerlich. Sie bringt absolut nichts. Natürlich können diese Dinge auch negativ gewertet werden, wenn man 100% schaffen will, aber eigentlich bedeutet das nur, dass es extrem viel Content gibt und das ist es wofür Botw steht. Dann kommt hinzu, dass man Pferde reiten kann, dass es viele verschiedene Kostüme mit verschiedenen Buffs gibt und dass die Waffen zerbrechen. Das könnte auch als negativ angesehen werden, was ich aber nicht finde, da man sonst die ganze Zeit nur mit seiner besten Waffe spielt und die anderen nicht braucht. So muss man überlegen, was taktisch klüger ist: Die gute Waffe zu benutzen oder eine eher schlechtere.
Doch natürlich hat auch Botw schlechte Punkte. Der größte ist, dass der Bosskampf lächerlich einfach ist. Ohne zu Spoilern: Der Bosskampf hat zwei Phasen. Die erste ist nicht schwer, aber anspruchsvoll und die zweite kann man nur schaffen. Der Boss macht keine Attacken und du selbst musst ihn nur oft genug treffen, dann ist er down. Außerdem wurden die alten bekannten Zelda-Dungeons durch vier Titanen gestrichen, die erstens weniger sind als die Dungeons und zweitens viel leichter als die klassischen Zelda-Dungeons sind, also kein guter Ersatz. Die 120 Schreine hingegen sind wirklich eine tolle Idee, sie machen wirklich Spaß.
Aber jedes Spiel hat so seine Macken und Fehler. Nichts desto trotz: Spielt dieses Spiel, ihr werdet es lieben und falls ihr es durchgespielt habt und es nicht mochtet, dürft ihr diese Bewertung ruhig mit ""Nein"" bewerten.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I highly recommend to play this game, this is the game with more liberty that i have played, you can go where ever you want, and keep the fun up.
The only bad point i would have to make is the shrines, no shrine is the same and you get fun and challenge in some of the side quests that lead us to them, all tho i dont seem to enjoy the shrine itself.

You can literally go from riding horseback to fighting divine beasts& guardians to exploring the vast amazing shrines, etc. Also it's easy as pie to replenish health and stamina with cooking. My personal favorite is cooking durian fruit. There is so much to do! I love this game",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Gonhl,06-03-2021,One of the best games ever. This openness without it getting boring. With 120 shrines and 900 koroks you also have a lot to do. Unfortunately the Reward for the 900 Koroks is garbage. The playing time for 100% is 220-300 hours.,9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
LukeCaputo,09-03-2021,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an outstanding game that offers players a variety of different avenues to pursue, regions to explore, and adventures to take on. The main character is Link, whom, after being asleep for one-hundred years - trapped in a long slumber - is tasked with defeating Ganon and saving Hyrule from an apocalyptic end.

What makes Breath of the Wild so different from other open-world games, however, is how much freedom you have in the world. You are free to do whatever you want in a giant, expansive world that offers loads of side quests and opportunities. Typically, with other open-world games, they have a story that they really want you to adhere to, but with BOTW, there's no set-in-stone story that you have to follow in order to progress yourself in the game. There's a main story, yes, but that's only for people who really crave a direct storyline from start to finish. You can do whatever you want from when you wake in the Shrine of Resurrection to the final boss fight in Hyrule Castle.

There is a tutorial in the beginning of the game to help you get acclimated with the controls and mechanics of the game in the form of five shrines. These individual shrines teach you how to use runes, which are very beneficial in the game and can help you overcome many obstacles. They are referred to as Remote Bombs (both spherical and cubic), Magnesis, Stasis, and Cryonis. You get these right at the very beginning of the game, because they will be very beneficial to you in the long run.

Then, once you get the paraglider from the old man (who actually turns out to be King Rhoam) by completing those shrines, you're free to do whatever you want. You can follow the main quests and go complete all the Divine Beasts (which I'll dive into later) and turn them back to the good guys' side, or, you can just roam free and do whatever you want. You can even attempt to take on Ganon straight away, although it would require an immense amount of skill and aptitude in order to defeat him with only three hearts and one stamina wheel. I personally wouldn't recommend doing that.

You can go ahead and try to get started on the conquest of completing all one-hundred and twenty shrines, each offering their own unique puzzle, and try to collect as many spirit orbs as you can so you can garner more hearts and stamina wheels, but finding the shrines can be a puzzle in its own right. There are some shrines that are locked away and have to be solved via a puzzle and some that are buried deep underground, waiting for the chosen hero to unlock them and bring them up to the surface. A lot of puzzle-solving, yes, in order to get some shrines, but it will all prove to be beneficial when you commence your fight with Calamity Ganon.

There is also a lot of lore in the game as well, providing backstory on Hyrule's past and how it fell into despair. These can be found through the 'Locked Memories' main quest, which has you go on a journey, scouring through Hyrule in search for a place where Link can recall them. This can be a trying task in its own right, but it's definitely worth it, and I would highly recommend it. And, also, if you want to advance the story at all, you kind of HAVE to do it. No pressure, but it's a very good thing to do in the game.

You don't even have to do that, though, in order to beat the game. As I mentioned earlier, you're free to do whatever you want in BOTW: fight enemy bases/camps, search for the lost spirits (otherwise known as Koroks) of the world, or just walk around and bask in the majesty and splendor of the world you're in. And complete a variety of different side quests, allowing you to explore the world in a new light each time.

The game is really all about exploration and finding things to do, and it's amazing how much attention to detail there is in the game. You could be exploring the Faron region, for example, and notice how the sky changes as you immerse yourself into that region. In that specific region, the climate is typically in a monsoon sort of state, which means it's almost always raining and very wet from time to time. But in the Gerudo region, it has a desert-like feel and follows the same guidelines that deserts do: intensely hot during the day, extremely cold during the night. It's amazing how diverse each region is.

One of the bigger and important quests in the game, however, is freeing the Divine Beasts. What you essentially do is take back the four Divine Beasts (Vah Medoh, Vah Rudania, Vah Ruta, and Vah Naboris) from the clutches of Ganon (who represents himself in different forms in each Divine Beast) and use them to take back Hyrule Castle, which has been overtaken by Ganon. Each Divine Beast offers its own challenges and obstacles for you to overcome, using your own wits and the tools the game has provided for you. Another reason to give Breath of the Wild infinite credit when it comes to adventure and survival.

MatchlockSamura,15-04-2021,"I do not understand why this game has so many 10 and 9 reviews. In my opinion, most things that 10 and 9 reviewers say is not true or at least shows inexperience with games - and what's more - Zelda games.

Let me start by saying what many ""negative"" or mediocre reviews say: this game isn't bad. It's actually pretty good on its own. But it's a terrible Zelda game. It really is. I came into this game expecting an amazing way to experience what I experienced in Twilight Princess, Skyward Sword, Ocarina of Time, etc. That did not happen, and if you're hoping for that, well you'll be as disappointed as me, sorry to say.

1. Exploration: That's the number one feature of this game. You explore, you see incredibly beautiful things, you climb mountains, soar the skies and swim up rivers. It's the definition of adventure. But here's the negative bit: it's. REALLY. boring. I don't know why, but there are very few rewards for exploring. What you get are Korok Seeds that you find throughout the map (there are over 900 of these lol) and you find Shrines. Korok Seeds get pretty pointless midway into the game because the upgrades you use them on get so expensive. But, this is what you get for exploring. Scenery, shrines and a pretty meh currency. That's it. You very very VERY rarely get unique weapons, clothes, or anything else for that matter.

2. Shrines: These are not fun. Please stop praising them. 80% of them are puzzles made either by or for children, 10% are just a freebee with no level and 10% are obscure puzzles (like the constellations one) that you will probably go online to see how to solve.

3. Story: People say the story, cutscenes and whatnot are very compelling. They are not. This is the most basic Zelda formula since the first Zelda. It's literally ""Gather X Y Z W and save Zelda."" I will, however, praise the freedom. The game is anything but linear, at least (which can be confusing at times, but it's alright). None of the characters are particularly interesting nor captivating but I suppose that's a matter of perspective. I find myself skipping 70% of the dialogue, and the cutscenes are some cringy **** sometimes. I don't know why there's voice acting either. Another ""new"" feature that has never been in a LoZ game, added for absolutely no reason whatsoever.

4. Music: The music is also very lackluster. It's quiet, and I respect what they were going for, but it's just too bland for me. Zelda has always had beautiful orchestral or woodwind scores, and for this game they heavily relied on the piano and silence. I personally really dislike it. Climbing a giant mountain in silence is really dull.

Now here's why this game is not a Zelda game:

There are no dungeons with mini-bosses and cool unique items.

There is no rolling.

There is no green tunic/hat unless you do all the shrines.

Most themes from past games aren't there.

The Triforce barely ever gets mentioned despite being consistently central to the series.

There are no unique bosses. Most ""bosses"" you fight are aspects of Ganon or overworld big mobs that you can find more than once or twice throughout the world.

There is no main gimmick like in many other LoZ game. In TP you can become a Wolf. In Minish Cap you become tiny and explore the world in that perspective. In OoT you travel time. In BotW there is nothing of the sort.

There is NO companion like Midna, Navi, Tatl, Fi, King of Red Lions, Ezlo, nothing. You play the game on your own, basically. Which is AWFUL because Link's companions have always been there to fill in the silence. Link never speaks and barely has any reaction to anything. The companions have always filled that void with their intricate personalities or interesting input. This is no more in BOTW.

There is voice acting.

Regular ****ty mobs can one shot you a lot of the times.

There are health bars for some reason.

I could fill a small book with many other complaints about this game, and I wish people would read it and stop looking at this game with such dramatic and in my opinion misguided opinions. Fanboys of the game tend to call negative opinions bots or triggered rivalry or even worse, ""purists"" for criticising the odd, new formula the game follows. It's a terrible witch-huntish way of thinking that curbs any and all discussion this game might summon.

I was very hyped to play it until I figured 5 hours into it that it just wasn't the type of game I wanted or thought it would be: a Zelda game. Many will call me a purist and say the old Zelda formula was stale: I disagree wholeheartedly. The ""old"" ""formula"" was Zelda's identity, and in my eyes, Nintendo has made BotW to be a generic open world RPG with no particular identity. It does nothing new, at best it improves features that other games had before it. It's a beautiful and alright standalone game, but it's certainly not groundbreaking and certainly not a 10, not by a longshot. It's likely the worst Zelda game in years.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Coolms9,18-04-2021,"This game is... interesting. I find the game incredibly good on the first initial playthrough, something just captures you. But on repeat playthroughs i find this game to be straight up boring, the main gameplay is based on exploration which gets pretty boring once you've explored enough. The main quest is also incredibly boring, only 4 dungeons which are incredibly simple. The combat is also pretty slow, while it is creative, it just isn't that fun.

beastmodeilleri,27-11-2021,"AMAZING GAME!

This game is hands down one of the best games I've ever played. It took a step out of the box when it comes to Zelda games. A ridiculously huge game with a huge, detailed landscape. However, it is not perfect.

The first thing that I must point out about this game is its graphics. Holy moly I've never seen better graphics, or even something that comes close to it in any game. It's nothing short of sexy. It's the first thing I notice and am reminded of every time I turn the game on.

Although the story in this game is not what is generally perceived as one of its main strengths, I think the story is underrated. Waking up in the shrine of resurrection after a crushing defeat at the hands of Ganon with all of your memories lost, just to wander back into the world were you are referred to as a ""hero"" in the presence of the public, and finding out about the events that took place before your defeat, piece by piece is according to me an element that makes the story very interesting and tempting to pursue. There's the different divine beasts and your comrades that own title of ""champions"", for instance, that are the main topics of every main city you enter, which plays a part in the whole ""finding out about the past"" part of the game.

Then there's the 120 shrines spread all across Hyrule. I think this was a good addition to the game. Entering a new shrine, where an entertaining puzzle/battle awaits brings a sense of excitement every time you spot a shrine.

Then to the negatives of this game.
The size of the world that the game takes place in is one of its main strengths, however, it was a little too big for my taste. You could sometimes wander around, confused about what to do next because of the huge map. This part of the game was extremely boring to be honest.

The soundtracks were also lame and didn't live up to the standard in comparison to the previous Zelda games.

So to conclude this review, although this game was indeed amazing, it's also overrated in my opinion. Still a 10/10 in my book, though. Is it the best game since its release? Yes. It is the best Zelda game ever? No.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

wuki,19-07-2021,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a really good Zelda game. The game's map is incredibly large and also incredibly extensive. The cutscenes in BOTW are also pretty good. However, I find the passages between the memories and also between the villages, shrines etc. far too lengthy. The music in BOTW is also good. (Fun fact: if you speed up the music from the Hylian field, you can hear Zelda's Lullaby). Unfortunately, I miss the story too much, which is what games like Ocarina of Time or Skyward Sword have. I give this game a rating of 8 out of 10 because the game feels incredibly free. You can cook what you want, you can carry the weapons you want, you can be where you want, this game defines freedom. I don't give it a 10 out of 10 because I just miss the story too much and the music isn't the best music in the whole series either.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

In adult life, it is a rarity to find media that produces a child-like sense of excitement with respect to the exploration and immersion into a new environment. Nintendo has successfully captured that feeling with Breath of the Wild's completely nonlinear game design with its spirit orb and Korok seed collectables and limitless exploration with this groundbreaking open-air design. The story is a little too bare-bones for what Nintendo touts as their story-telling franchise and there are a few annoying gameplay mechanics (i.e. excessive rain limiting your ability to climb), but these are minor issues in the face of what the game does right.

Though compared to other titles in the series, the dungeons are lacking, that criticism leaves such a small dent on my enjoyment of this game is doesn't even knock it down one point. This entry is very different to other titles in the series and feels almost like a survival game in a way. If you have a flaming sword and you strike wood, it makes a campfire. If you go out in the snowy mountains, Link's cheeks will get red from the cold. This game has so many small details like that packed into one small cartridge I'm still finding new things every time I boot up the game. Unlike any other Zelda game, weapons break, which, especially early on, makes you think about how you can take on this enemy (or get away) rather then just swinging your sword blindly. In terms of story, its simple. VERY simple. Your objective is to beat Ganon, and you can do that as soon as you finish the tutorial or after you collect all 900 Korok seeds. It's your choice.

Tikur,12-07-2022,"I have just completed this game and in my opinion get this game more praise than it's deserve.

Sure it is a very fun and experimental game, where you have many opportunities to complete it.

The good aspects first.

I really like the concept of the game that you can go to Ganon, the final boss, when ever you want. This leads to countless different ways to play and experience it. In consequence it gets also a lot of replay value, because of the different options you have to reach the goal.

The shrines, one of the most controversial new addition for nearly all of the players, is also one of my favourite new elements the developer have added. The little puzzle rooms, work like a collectible and also as tricky little puzzles to keep the motivation high. The player is always in control of the pace and able to make free decisions on his own.

Another top aspect is the world itself. Hyrule looks beautiful, has a lot of secrets to explore and offers a variety of environments. The complete world feels alive and the music which unusually subtle for a Zelda game fits it all perfectly.

However, now here are my issues with the game.

The new element, that your weapons will broke down, is annoying all the time you play and especially at the beginning simply frustrating. You only get weak weapons which will broke down very quickly, so you need to get another weak weapon. Thankfully this gets better when you make more progress. But this Problem runs through the entire game.

The second complain I have is the camera angle, especially in combat. They have never improved on that since 1998. At that time it was not that bad, because at that time there weren't much enemies on the screen. But now You it can easily happen, that you have to face four or five enemies simultaneously. At that point you realise that the combat system is not made for situations like that.
The final boss fight against Ganon is really bad and a huge disappointment. Clunky controls and an outdated concept are the main reasons for that.

My last complain is the praise itself that the game gets. This is by far not the best game on switch.
Super Mario Odyssey and Kirby and the forgotten Land are by far the better games, because they implemented their new features, way more clever than Breath of the Wild did. Both games also feel more polished, than Breath of the Wild.

It is clearly a good game but far away from being a masterpiece.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

lowey,22-04-2022,"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said about BOTW: it's a beautiful game which, for the most part, plays very smoothly, and is generally just great fun.

As I picked my way through the 140+ hours I invested into this game I imagined I would leave the game with a score of around 5-7. My main complaint was with the controls, they just never really gelled for me. But as I got to the 50+ hours mark it started to be less painful to play, and by the time I was 100+ hours in I was in love with it, in spite of the controls.

At the beginning of the game I was frustrated that it seemed as if every single character in the game was much stronger than Link. I was burning through my resources staying alive in even the most basic of fights. And it was impossible to find enough arrows! Every NPC I met would talk at length about how Link was a great hero and only he had the strength to wield the master sword, yet even the smallest enemies would murder me with just a couple of hits!

But all of these things improve if you persevere.

What I found very frustrating was the fact that, at times, it wasn't clear what was needed in order to progress and often I had to look things up. If I have to look things up then the game's failed to communicate its ideas properly. And some things that you need to do regularly, like cooking, aren't done in a way that allows you to work in bulk to get the job done quickly so that you can return to gaming… it can be a boring process cooking meals so that you don't die in the middle of your next battle!

While I loved exploring the large open world and getting quests, the main storyline was actually a bit boring. Music was, in places, very good. But in most places, listening to the same few tracks for 140 hours got somewhat tedious. Voice acting was good for some characters, but not great for Zelda herself. As the principle character and the character with the most lines I honestly expected better.

While there was evidence that the designers had tried to make Zelda a stronger character in this game, rather than just a damsel in distress, they didn't really succeed. She has her moments, but ultimately, at its core, this is really just another game about a bloke fighting a dragon (of sorts) to retrieve a princess from a castle. I'd have loved to have seen something new and original here. Still, it didn't feel like a waste of time, I just felt like the main storyline could have been so much stronger.

So my verdict is that this is a game that takes a while to get into, for me at least, but it's worth sticking with to the bitter end as I thoroughly enjoyed the game in the end and was glad I invested the time. It just took a lot of frustrating hours to get to that point!",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Pembroke_Watts,13-03-2022,"In breath of the wild, you have the freedom to play the way you want. If you choose, you can go the final area as soon as you finish the great plateau, or you can spend 300 hours exploring every single corner of the map. Every playthrough will be different, as the game does not have a strictly linear way of progressing through the story. Lastly, you always have quite a few options on how to approach each fight, with no clearly superior choice, which makes the combat extremely creative.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
TGious,17-10-2021,"This is the greatest game of the decade hands down. Everything about this game is just so damn fun to do.

So many mini dungeons and korok puzzles to do that I am 300 hours in and still am nowhere near done with this gigantic game. While the dungeons are not the strongest in the series, they fit the style of breath of the wild, and the 120 shrines make up for the lack of larger dungeons. Hyrule castle is the best it has ever been in terms of the sheer scale and amount of secrets. So many unique enemies and different areas to explore. The map is so detailed and has some of the best designed areas in any video game map. I could go on for hours ranting about how good this game is, but this review is getting long enough.

With the best tutorial segment of a game ive ever experienced, within an hour and a half the player has access to the entirety of the enormous map, leaving them free to climb, run, sail or ride across the incredibly diverse and stunning landscapes Hyrule has to offer.

With a vast and expansive physics engine the player is free to experiment with anything and everything leading to hundreds of exciting discoveries and ""wow, i never knew you could do that!"" moments.

The story, while a tad too bare, is good enough and the post apocalyptical theme of the game is clearly insinuated through the ruins and abandoned buildings throughout Hyrule. Players will find themselves in an enormous stone coliseum which is falling apart and swarming with powerful enemies, an abandoned place of worship, and a ruined and fragmented castle, once the symbolism of royalty and power in the land.

Music and sound design are stunning, with ambient piano melodies taking up the majority of the background themes. this lets the player feel relaxed and depicts the peace and tranquility of the ruined Hyrule, once a bustling metropolis. There are some amazing orchestral arrangements too, most notably Solitary Warrior: Revali, Hyrule Castle, and Attack on Divine Beast Vah Medoh.

The rest is just a hide and seek map game. Not Zelda. Hopefully they change that in the next Zelda which I hope is not Breath of the wild 2.

So u won't stuck in the middle of the game because u can't find a place/npc to proceed.

The only complain is some shrine is really hard to find. I only manage to find 90/120 shrine when playing on my own without googling/youtubing for guide. (but then u still can complete the story without finding all shrine, so...perfect?)

thomanime,26-11-2021,"Probably the most overrated game of the last 10 years. It has many solid aspects, as art direction, animations, and in my opinion, combat, but the repetition and design problems in this game go much deeper than the good aspects. There are pretty much two types of enemies in the open-world of Breath of the Wild, Bokoblins and Lizalfos. And that's such a weird decision for me, because there are many types of enemies in the game, but 99% of the population of the game is these two. Of course, there are various variations of these enemies in each region of the game, depending on the climate, but still, they have the same A.I. pretty much. It's fun for the first couple of hours, and considering how much variety the combat can have with sheikah state habilities, even more than that, but it eventually drains out. Doesn't matter how beautiful and interesting an open-world is, if there is the same type of enemy everywhere. Another overrated aspect of this game is exploration. I remember having really high expectations for the exploration of this game at the start, until I realized the only new thing you find is loot that will break in 3 hits, and...shrines. Some shrines work very well and are fun, especially considering how dynamic and flexible some of them can be, but those that are less flexible and depend on controller movement are just boring. And in general, they could be way more difficult.
The weapons are also too fragile, and, the game uses that as an excuse for everyone to try new and different weapons, which is pretty valid by itself, but every weapon feel like it's made out of wood. There's no reward hunting new and better weapons, because all of them break in a feel hits. They could get rid of this system entirely, which would already make it more fun, because as much as it was made thinking about variation, in the end, everyone keeps some good weapons in the inventory and uses only the bad ones, because we don't want it to break. Another option would be making the bad weapons very fragile, and the good ones resist hundreds of hits. Or just make the better weapons unbreakable. That way you would try various weapons at the start of the game and then keep using the ones you know are good and more fun.

Another problem related to design is the divine beasts. They look very interesting, I like their start, but the puzzles are just...awful. Badly designed, not making clear what your goal is. They are basically giant shrines, but, worse. And the boss battles are interesting until you realize all four are the same. It also serves as a base to the history, but, there's pretty much no history in BOTW. Everything is lore, there's pretty much nothing envolving the modern link and how he is adapting to the loss of memory, it's all about the stuff that happened with him 100 years ago, which makes the player disconnected with the world.

The world is also way too bloated in relation to the content. You will expend most of the time of the game floating through air or riding a horse. It's just too little content spread out, unlike a game like The Witcher 3 for example, the density of the game just doesn't compensate the content.

I could go on and on about how they could improve the systems and make the history, characters, boss battles, and weapons more interesting, but this is already a good enough summary of what I think. I hope Nintendo learns lessons with this game.",6,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

When Nintendo announced that the new Legend of Zelda would be an open-world RPG (that runs on Wii U) I was skeptical that they would archive something great and original, without creating cliches in gameplay mechanics.
Zelda Breath of the Wild not only it's original, but it's also so revolutionary that every single new open-world game has ripped off its mechanics.
There is a problem with open-world games, and it's the open world. An open-world game that just uses these mechanics to fill the entire world with sidequest and collectibles has failed to reach its purpose. What's the point of having a vast world where it's possible to reach any location if there is nothing to do? Or what if I'm too low on XP to enter a specific region? At that point, the game loses its mechanic of being open-world, because it demands the player to do specific quests or farm enough to enter a location.
Breath of the Wild has none of those problems. The game starts immediately by saying what you have to do, and you can do it right away. The only real main quest is given at the start of the game, all the other quests are story-related, and will give you a big advantage in the final boss battle.
Breath of the Wild also has a very specific level system. Instead of farming XP to use better equipment or unlock skills, you get better by playing, and so do monsters, becoming stronger and stronger, and dropping more quality weapons.
The only thing that can be level-up in Zelda is the HP and Stamina, in order to do that you have to complete shrines, which are scattered across all the map, and that is the best part of the game. No matter where you go, you will always ""progress"" in the main quest, by getting stronger and having more chance of winning.
There are also many side quests, and each one of them is different from the other, resulting in a unique experience for all of them, and removing the sense of already seen, that many open-world games have.
The things you can do with the elements reminded me of the golden age of Far Cry 2, while the physics are well thought almost to a Half_life level.
You can set fires in a forest and direct it with the wind of a fan through the enemies' campsite; during a storm, you can equip an iron blade to attract lighting and toss it near enemies when they are about to strike. There is so much potential in this game that you can spend hours just having fun with these two mechanics.
The game isn't perfect as it has some bugs, and with the DLC, after upgrading the Master Sword to the max level, the game gets too easy; while the Master mode, unlocked at the end of the game, takes too long to kill one enemy, especially at the start of the game. Perhaps the biggest problem is the inventory; being able to carry 100 dishes that fully heal back all my HP makes the game way too easy (and I just need to collect some fruit to do that).
Zelda Breath of the Wild it's an incredible experience, something that many game houses should take note of, sit down and understand, and try to elaborate in a new experience rather than just straight up copying its mechanics and gameplay, because no other games were able to.

Kostas_Spirou,23-12-2022,"An Artistic Masterpiece.
Breath of the Wild has the most enjoyable Open World I've ever explored in a videogame, I've played the game for hundreds of hours and I never got bored, there's always something to do in it.

For a game that doesn't emphasize on telling a story... the story is actually quite interesting, nothing special but it serves its purpose.

It's a very rewarding experience, and the world is absolutely massive with so many secrets and details, everything works as intended, which results in a masterfully crafted world full of life.

Finding shrines, doing puzzles, clearing camps and endlessly exploring the lands always feels fresh, there's a good amount of content within this game, and despite its repetitive nature, the game never actually gets repetitive.

As for the combat, it's decent, it might feel clunky at first but everything gets better once you get used to the controls. Also, the weapon durability can get in the way, it's a little bit annoying because most weapons break very easily, but it's not a big issue later on.

Weirdly enough, the physics play a huge role within the gameplay... just wow, the way every little thing coexists and interacts with each other is absolutely insane, and the attention to detail is groundbreaking.

There are so many things you can do, so many ways to interact with the world, use the environment as a tool or a weapon, solve puzzles in very creative ways and so much more. This game makes you think outside of the game, it treats the player as a smart person and gives you time to think before you act.

The art-style is very unique and pretty, but it's inconsistent, the lighting during night time can look weird, the textures are outdated, and there are some slight frame drops. It's a beautiful game sadly held back by some very small graphical and technical problems, but nothing to worry about, the game runs very well most of the time.

Breath of the Wild is a revolutionary game, and it changed the Open World formula forever, which inspired many other games to follow its steps.

Final Rating: ""Masterpiece"" ~ 10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
SaraMetacritic,30-12-2021,"Warning: this has a lot of spoilers.
This game is one of the best of the Zelda games, but it also has some bad things, though, and that’s why this is a nine for me. Note: this is personal opinion, some people may find some things that I consider bad as good things.
Bad points:
- The puzzles in game (usually kolog seeds puzzles, there is more variety on other puzzles) are too repetitive, always same mechanics in most of them, there are some of them that are creative, and so more difficult, though.
- The bosses don’t have personality, they are just a kind of shadows that attack you, everyone of them with different attacks depending on what bosses they are but they are all the same. In other Zelda games, like Ocarina of Time, the bosses had different forms, being some of them a kind of clone of Link that is a ghost to a dragon that looks like the chinese ones. It would be really cool to see bosses like this in this game, but after all they are used to be things that only think in destroy, according to the game, so this can be good or bad depending in the opinion.

Good points:
- This is the first Zelda game where the characters talk (Link is the only exception, as he’s the only one that doesn’t talk), making the gamer feel more like if they were inside the game. Also, the traductions to different languages are perfect, in my opinion.
- There are many things to do, many missions, many hidden places to discover, many places to visit, many monsters to attack, many other animals to interact with between others, so you can enjoy this game by many ways, trying to get the final boss, Ganon, faster or trying to complete everything in this game.
- The cooking system has many varieties, you can find them by seeing a poster somewhere, a character telling you a recipe, trying all possible combinations of food, or even a recipe book. It’s also a good point that if you are in a cold place you’ll find things that are adapted to a cold climate and give you resistance to the very hot places, in the “normal” places, with “normal” climate, you’ll find insects, mushrooms, etc. that will give you other effects like speed or attack boost, and in hot climate same thing, but with the respective climate.
- Something a bit similar to the last point, if there is a storm, the metalic items will attract lightning, so you will get struck by one, if you are in the volcano, the wooden items will break, etc.
- The mechanics: a bomb kills all the fish in the zone the bomb is exploding, breaking trees can give the player access to other zones by acting like a bridge, with fire arrows you burn ropes, that will make something fall, like a ramp, giving (in the case it was a ramp) access to the player to get to wherever the ramp ended, bomb arrows don’t work when raining, wind makes the bombs move, if you explode a bomb near to something explosive, it will explode too, making a stronger explosion, between many others.
- You can climb, swim, cook, walk, run, snowboard with shields, swimming faster consumes more energy, climbing faster consumes more energy, running consumes energy. You can’t dive, but the point I want to get to is that you have many ways to move.
- The variety of clothes: there are many different clothes, all of them with different characteristics, depending on where you can find them, the amount of money or the difficulty of the puzzle and what do you need to get them, for example, clothes in Gerudo city are clothes with heat resistance and usually girl clothes. Clothes you earn by puzzles related to electricity give you resistance to lightnighs and electricity in general, not complete resistance, as if you have full electricity resistance a lightning might still hurt you. If you upgrade clothes, they will defend you more, with my personal best armor enemies hardly make me severe damage.
- Last but not least (I would add more but there is a 5000 character limit), the graphics. Just by seeing the trailer you realize how fresh this game looks, in my opinion it looks so beautiful, I don’t think there are big light glitches, maybe small details, but that’s something that I can’t say with all games.
Hope this helped you!",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

F1ightless,06-01-2022,"Breath of The Wild is on-par with many celebrated open-world experiences and creates a powerful and intriguing immersion between you and the world it creates. Zelda has always been prominent on the market and is one of the most critically acclaimed games in recent memory. Rather than creating waypoints and forcing players to trek the barren world with nothing inside, it spreads the content throughout the map facilitating getting lost and creating one's own experiences. However, it would be a surface level observation to classify the game as perfect and as time has progressed the game has aged poorly. My first complaint lies in the shrines, having many mini-dungeons instead of half a dozen big ones is a new direction for the series and while some are fun, short challenges, others feel boring, monotonous or easily cheesed. Divine beasts are nice reliefs but if they are actually on par with previous areas is debatable and I'd argue against it. My next issue is the story and dialogue, with LoZ being Nintendo's 'story game' it's disappointing seeing it being as average as it always has been and cutscenes which look visually stunning are off-put by Link yet again being a grunting, emotional wall per usual. It's definitely time to give Link a voice and is what I'm hoping for most in the remake actually being achieved well. Enemy variety is small but only a minor complaint due to the versatility of the minimal monsters available as well as their hilarious interactions. All of these are only minor in comparison to the next issue: replayability. The Great Plateau is an hour-long tutorial if you want to make sure to pick up all the items around the place and can never be skipped and if you're not trying to speedrun the game, most runs continue similarly (go to kakariko and see impa, run all the way to hateno, go back and then take on your divine beast of choice after maybe tackling a couple of shrines) and pulls you out of the experience for the first couple hours. However, once you leave the early game, it presents you with a magical adventure coupled with the childlike whimsicality contrasted by the edge that makes Zelda so entertaining.

You literally have to do a picture quest if you want to get any semblance of a story or character development. The open world is pretty empty other than scattered enemy encampments and repetitive inns throughout. The puzzle dungeons were interesting but repetitive and not very fun.

The open world is fantastic, if a little underwhelming in terms of the number of interactions with actually interesting characters. Side quests are plentiful but many of them are a little, well, lame, and several have anticlimactic conclusions. With that being said, they’re still an absolute blast and the puzzles and riddles are great. Speaking of puzzles, the 100+ shrines are quite fun too, if a little easy in most cases. The ONLY real gripe of mine is the durability system. You will often find multiple weapons and shields breaking within the same battle against just one or two enemies. It’s easily the most frustrating aspect of the game and the only thing that you’ll find actually detracting from the experience. If you have a Switch, BOTW is an absolute must-play.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Apartado artístico que a dia de hoy, me sigue pareciendo el mas bonito, graficos que explotan las capacidades de la consola a la que pertenece, siendo un juego de salida de consola y que a dia de hoy no ha sido desbancado de esa posición. En lo jugable es una delicia, la exploración es extremadamente satisfactoria y el juego logra provocar cada 10 segundos la curiosidad de que habrá si sigo este camino, detrás de esa montaña o en ese acantilado. Una minuscula pega, quizá la unica junto con los jefes de cada bestia divina, es el desgaste de las armas, excesivamente rápido aunque entiendo su finalidad. La historia es sencilla pero muy bien realizada y con momentos que favorecen la inmersión en el juego, breve y presentada de tal manera que no entorpezca el eje central del juego, la exploración y sensación de aventura.

No voice acting for link how come a game like this the protagonist do not talk currently one of the most important aspects of the best games ever made is the protagonist and voice acting of the character that makes us fall in love with games like arthur morgan or kratos , nathan drake and many many characters. zelda botw is good game but not S tier or best ever or what so ever you call it you can not put it besides red dead redemption 2 or god of war, last of us or many many games who are much better on many aspects and again i am not telling it is a bad game i am playstation fan but i really like to explore many and different games from the playstation system it is a really good game but not that much as most of you claiming it is the best ever or the 10/10 reviews i think it’s fair review 8 or 8.5",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

BrianDavid94,29-08-2022,"Quick background on me the reviewer, I tend to like single player games that is heavy on narrative the most. I also play a lot of racing games and use to play multiplayer games in my high school days but now that it's hard for me and my friends to find a good time to link up so now it’s more rare for me to get into a multiplayer game. Up to try any genre of games and sometimes I find something new that I didn't think I'd like. I own a PC (built by me), Xbox One X, Xbox Series X, PS3, PS4, PS5, and a Switch. I prefer Playstation due to their focus on narrative games. For scoring, I’ll be using the Gameinformer review scale and of coursed influenced by my personal opinions.

(10)Outstanding. A truly elite title that is nearly perfect in every way. This score is given out rarely and indicates a game that cannot be missed.

This is my first Zelda game and I enjoyed every minute of this game. It got me through a 7 month deployment without getting bored. You can spend an eternity finding all the little secrets of this game. I enjoyed all the puzzles and the world building. The only thing that could use a little adjusting is how often your weapons break. The world and side stories is more then enough to carry this one inconvenience.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Rydia030,21-02-2022,"Aunque debo aceptar que la formula clásica me gusta mas para zelda, creo este juego cumple y muy bien, aunque hay muchos sitios en los que avanzas sin realmente hacer nada, se sienten vacíos, es algo que suele pasar en la mayoría de títulos de este genero por el tamaño del mapa, aunque se extrañan los dungeons y las peleas con sus jefes, las 4 maquinas sagradas en el juego tienen su plus que lo hace muy bueno, la pelea final se ve bien, pero creo si deja algo que desear, no se si por que el final en twilight princess fueron combates finales muy emotivos contra ganon-ganaondorf o que fue porque lo senti muy simple, pero eso no significa que mal, creo lo mejor del juego mas que terminarlo, es el crafteo de armaduras, buscar los dragones y estar cazandolos por una escama, y las batallas con las bestias sagradas es lo mas destacable.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

mars042,21-02-2022,"To this day (feb, 21st, 2022), Breath of the Wild remains as my favorite game of all time: I wish I could erase my memories of it so I could play it again ''like the very first time''.

I like the gameplay mechanics, the music, the art style (wich will age pretty well compared to many contemporary games).
Many people complain about the breakability of weapons. But I felt it was I good mechanic to encourage combat creativity, it encourages the player to use every single tool on it's inventory (food, clothes, arrows, shields, weapons, special abilities) and also the enviroment.
I've played all 3D Zeldas and most of the 2D ones. BOTW is a nice turn back to some of the features that made NES original such a great, challenging game.

Mechki,26-02-2022,"Per me il gioco migliore di sempre. Un open world vastissimo e pieno di segreti, una lore che abbraccia tutti gli altri Zelda, un comparto tecnico chiaramente adatto alla potenza della switch però accompagnato da una direzione artistica strepitosa. Ogni cosa che pensi che si possa fare, si può realmente fare, visto che la fisica è accuratissima, inoltre le musiche ed i suoni sono tra i migliori nel mercato videoludico. Chiaramente non è esente da difetti, come qualche calo di framerate, qualche sbavatura grafica, qualche glitch qui e li e qualche albero che non può essere distrutto.

rome_del,27-02-2022,"I give this amaing game a 9. I don't give it a 10 for two reasons. the map sometimes feels empty even tho there is plenny of mysteries to discover, the lands still a bit empty. The second reason is the difficulty of the game. there are only 4 bosses to defeat before ganon and if you defeat them ganon starts the battle with half of his health so that makes it easier. If you go strait to Ganon the difficulty will be increased and its a chame that the finam battle it's easiear when you beat all of the bosses and harder when you don't.
But overall this game is amazing, with lots of misteries, amazing cutscenes and carismatic characters plus the liberty to wear whatever armor you want and explore the field.
I'm looking fordward to BOTW2 and i hope they will correct theses little flops",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

DarkwingSchmuck,04-03-2022,"Breath of the Wild is a necessary and mostly successful reinvention of The Legend of Zelda. Everything about this game was taken back to the drawing board -- so much so that it takes a bit to rewire your brain from all the things video games have taught you in the past.

As far as open-world exploration goes, Breath of the Wild is second to none. Its vast, gorgeous wide open map is like one big Zelda dungeon that you can explore at your own leisure. Go anywhere, do anything, and experiment with anything and everything. You can't walk 10 feet without tripping over things to do in this game.

If the inevitable sequel can ditch the awful weapon degradation mechanic, add some full dungeons to explore, and allow you to climb when it's raining instead of waiting around for five minutes until the skies clear, then it will have the potential to be something truly special.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

guicalistrato,04-03-2022,"The Legend of Zelda:Breath of the Wild é, na minha opinião, o melhor jogo da história. Nos próximos parágrafos irei discutir o que me faz pensar desse modo.
Pra começar, o jogo tem, literalmente, centenas de horas de conteúdo, um mapa gigante e muito diverso, contendo desertos, planícies, tundras, taigas, muitas montanhas, pântanos e mais. Mesmo depois de muito tempo de jogo, você acaba encontrando algo novo periodicamente. A exploração do jogo é fantástica, a melhor entre todos os que já vi. O combate do jogo é sensacional, com dezenas de armas diferentes que exercem seus papéis, uma grande lista de estilos de luta e estratégias, itens pra auxiliar em combates, bençãos, etc, o jogo bera a perfeição num aspecto que nem é seu foco.
A história é surpreendente boa, apesar de não chegar no nível de outros aspectos. Descobrir e relembrar o que aconteceu em Hyrule por memórias perdidas, contos e ensinamentos de outros foi uma boa ideia, apesar de que acho que faltou se aprofundar um pouco.
Não tenho palavras para descrever a trilha sonora, composta boa parte por sons ambientes que se encaixam bem, o destaque mesmo vai para músicas de verdade, posso citar Lurelin Village Theme, Revali Theme, Calamity Ganon Phase 2, etc. É impressionante como há músicas incríveis em tantos estilos musicais diferentes.
Os maiores problemas que vejo em Zelda:BotW são a baixa variedade de inimigos, perda de performance em alguns momentos e gráficos não tão bons (algo que pode ser explicado pelo hardware não tão potente do Switch). Apesar disso, o jogo é incrível e com certeza vale a pena jogar",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The story is amazing, the combat, travel and action is so god damn fun and the enviroment helps the combat a lot, the way you can interact with everything makes the world feel so realistic, it looks beautiful by an amazing art direction, the characters are very well written and interesting, the Open World is MASSIVE and it doesn't feel empty, it feels ALIVE by the overwhelming amount of animals, NPCs and enemies (There's a few areas less inspired than others) but in general is great, there's an infinite amount of interactions by the overwhelming amount of options to attack or experiment in general, you can challenge Ganon (The final boss) after inmedieatly finishing the tutorial (The tutorial itself is massive and fun), I can't express enough how good this game is.

The only complaints i would have is that some of the shrines feel a little bit repetitive but nothing truly annoying, the desert and snowy areas have sections that Do feel kind of empty and the Korok forest makes the game run at like less than 20 FPS. But it didn't ruin the overall experience.

highly recommend, excited for the sequei",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ReyhanFarook,24-03-2022,"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an absolute hallmark of game design. The open world is absolutely breath-taking and the mind boggling level of freedom in the way you explore and interact with Hyrule truly is incredible. The game is far from perfect, but what it does right is done so well that it far outweighs the negatives of the game. The story is quite bad, most of it is exposition and the voice acting is not good at all. However, the story is not shown that much in the game, it seems more like a supplementary thing than an actual part of the game. Another gripe I have with the game are the dungeons. The divine beasts were relatively fun but they lacked the variety that was seen in older Zelda games. I am hoping the sequel improves upon this.
Overall, I believe that this game is one of the most innovative games ever. While there are issues with it, the stellar gameplay almost completely invalidates those issues.

CouchPotato200,06-04-2022,"On its own, this game is amazing. But when compared to other Zelda games, it doesn't really stack up. In fact I really don't think this game should be compared to other Zelda games because of how different it is. They completely changed the Zelda formula and I'd say it didn't work out. And with a sequel of this game on the horizon, it makes me think that maybe open-world is the future of Zelda. And I'm not a huge fan of that. When can we go back to the old Zelda formula? With the dungeons and the items and stuff. This game barely even has dungeons! Again, it's a great game, it's just an awful Zelda game.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Koukaboora,28-04-2022,"This is my favorite Zelda game to date. The style of the game is great and the world really feels like a battered and broken Hyrule. The characters you run into are funny and charismatic. There were tons of hidden mechanics in the game that I loved finding out about like the ability to warm yourself in cold temps by equipping red hot fire weapons. There is so much to like about the game and there is a big emphasis on exploration and creativity.

With that said, the reason I didn't give this game a perfect score is because there were so aspects of the game that I was not the biggest fan of. One of the biggest complaints that people have with this game was the weapon durability. I never really had an issue with this mechanic until I played on hero mode. I basically took a couple of weapons per enemy and it got to the point where I was using cheese strats to deal with enemies because it was more efficient. Another issue I had was with the enemy/dungeon variety. It was cool to see the classic Zelda enemies rendered in modern hardware but it sucked that there were only 6-7 enemy types and just recolored versions of them. I wasn't too excited for the DLC and I don't think it made the experience too much better.

For being one of the first games on the switch, let alone the first Zelda entry on the Switch, it was a really good entry into the franchise. I am excited to see what they have in store for future entries and hope that they improve on the system/world that they have already built.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Rhex98,01-05-2022,"Directamente lo considero el mejor videojuego de la Nintendo Switch y de los mejores videojuegos de la historia. Visualmente se ve bastante bien, no necesita ser un portento grafico ya que el apartado artístico hace que se vea hermoso. Argumentalmente es bastante ambiguo pero es interesante el ver como Link se encuentra en un escenario 100 años después de que hayan perdido contra Ganondorf. Lo que mas destaca en este juego es el gameplay, como este va evolucionando de manera orgánica mientras avanzas por el escenario y como puedes interactuar con prácticamente todo. En el juego puedes avanzar a tu gusto y en el orden que desees, si quieres vencer a ganondorf desde el principio puedes hacerlo, si quieres hacerlo después de tener el 100% puedes hacerlo, es espectacular en este apartado. La música es en su mayoría ambiental pero funciona por el tipo de juego que es.

Immediately stepping out from the Shrine of Resurrection and looking out over the vast world, I knew that this game was indeed something special. Combat, dungeons, enemies, and bosses are all reimagined to fit this giant open-air world. Honestly, anyone can dump hundreds of hours into this masterpiece and not experience everything it holds. Every square inch of the world is littered with hundreds of collectibles that will keep you busy.

Just plain and Simple its great. the gameplay is great, and the bosses while similar feel different enough that they don't feel the same. the divine beasts while not the greatest Zelda dungeons are pretty good. they strike the perfect balance of not a cakewalk but not so hard you just look at a guide in frustration. the graphics are great the art style is unique and gorgeous. the amount of little things to find and do in this game make it feel endless. Breath of the wild is great because of how you can play how you want, if you want to do all the divine beasts get all the memory's do every shrine and quest and all the korok seeds etc.. (you see why the game feels endless?) or do nothing of that and make your fun in the wild, its in the name after all Breath of the WILD. you can go mess around with the physics of the game when you get bored. you can nitpick it all you want but i bet your favorite can be nitpicked to death aswell. no game is perfect for everybody but this feels the best ""real game"" for anybody due to being able to do whatever it you want and make your own fun. the only ""main"" cons i can think about is weapon breaking and the story not being huge but weapon breaking never felt annoying it made it feel like you had to strategize a little bit for the ""perfect playthrough"" but there was always ways to get most good items back or get better ones. for the story its a double sided blade you make the story more prominent but loss a little of the ""no rules, make your own fun"" mentality of the game and the story itself is not bad it just not a 4 hour directors cut of the worlds best movie type of story. this game is great to the point that it overcame nostalgia to beat out Mario galaxy as my favorite game of all time. no game is perfect but if any is the closest Breath of the wild is.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

WaffleBoiX,28-08-2022,"For the people that hate this game let me tell you that this isn't the game for everybody, this is a very different zelda game and people need to accept that. This game takes place 10,000 years in the future (of the other zelda games) so of course its gonna be different. I love exploring the world as there's so much to do, the game wants you to explore and basically find out stuff on your own by exploring its vast world. Compared to all other zelda games this one is a very slow paced game and that's why some people don't like it. I like the shrines since most of them have different puzzles and you get rewarded for completing them. Enemies are hard and you will die a lot in this game but I like a challenge, it feels satisfying when you finnaly beat a boss that took lost of time to beat. I love the game but there are stuff I don't like like how fast weapons break, I understand rusty weapons but other weapons break too fast, kind of the only flaw with the game in my opinion.

justko,01-01-2023,"The open-world adventure game The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is genuinely revolutionary and has raised the bar for similar titles. Breath of the Wild, a video game created and released by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch and Wii U consoles, has garnered numerous honors and awards since its debut in 2017. These awards and recognitions include Game of the Year at The Game Awards and multiple Game of the Year awards from different publications.

As Link, the main character of the Legend of Zelda series awakens from a 100-year nap to a world that has been altered by an enigmatic force known as the Calamity Ganon, you take control of him in Breath of the Wild. You discover the mysteries of the past and find the strength required to finally destroy Calamity Ganon as you traverse the game's expansive and gorgeously rendered land of Hyrule.

The open-world concept of Breath of the Wild, which lets you explore and learn at your own speed, is one of its most stunning features. A variety of settings, including lush woods, snow-capped mountains, parched deserts, and perilous swamps, may be found throughout the game's wide, spreading landscape. The game's dynamic weather system and day-night cycle further enhance the richness and realism of the world, which is filled with secrets and hidden treasures to be discovered in each location.

However, Breath of the Wild's impressiveness extends beyond only its setting to the ways in which you can engage with it. The game features a variety of novel gameplay elements, such as the capacity to climb virtually any surface and the capacity to solve puzzles based on physics. The game encourages experimentation and exploration while allowing you to tackle difficulties in a variety of inventive ways thanks to these mechanisms.

Breath of the Wild offers a plethora of side quests and mini-games in addition to the main quest. These range from preparing meals and making remedies to racing other players and taking part in archery competitions. You can gather materials and make your own weapons, armor, and other equipment using the game's complex crafting system.

The combat system in Breath of the Wild is one of the game's most notable aspects since it is intricate and difficult. The game adds a number of new tools and skills, such as the capacity to parry and block enemy blows as well as perform elemental attacks. The game's AI for the adversaries is also very sophisticated, and they react differently based on the time of day and where you are.

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is an open-world adventure game that, all things considered, is incredibly impressive and raises the bar. Its expansive and exquisitely detailed universe, cutting-edge gameplay elements, and intricate combat system all work together to provide for an absolutely remarkable gaming experience. Breath of the Wild is a must-play whether you love open-world adventure games in general or the Legend of Zelda franchise in particular.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

ELYS1UM,21-09-2022,"This game changed my life when I played it five years ago. Back then I liked playing video games, yes, but it was just something to pass the time. This game was the first time I was ever truly immersed into a fictional world, and it led me down the path to becoming who I am today. I would never have discovered my passion for the medium of video games if not for Breath of The Wild. I would never have met some of my closest friends if not for Breath of The Wild. Three are so many facets of myself and my personality that I discovered because of my time playing this game. It has such an incredible soundtrack that's minimalistic and tries to stay out of the way of the sounds of the world. It has beautiful graphics and art direction, and incredible UI. It has a rich world that's rewarding to explore from head to toe. It has a fun combat system that encourages players to not only upgrade their gear, but learn how to employ advanced techniques like parrying or flurry rushing to speed along tough battles. The game is pure, unadulterated, fun. Of course, video games are art, and people will never be able to come to unanimous decisions on it. As well as this, the game is not perfect. It would benefit greatly from a stronger narrative, and better performance. Yet, these issues mean nothing to me when I'm running, or swimming, or climbing, or riding, or even warping my way around the vast and enthralling world of Hyrule. I will always love this game no matter what happens. Because this is one of the few games that I can truly say from the bottom of my heart, changed my life.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

TheRadiantMoth,21-10-2022,"This game is far from perfect but it is still one of the best games I have ever played.
It has many issues which people who are very critical of it are quick to point out. The combat has issues like the weapon breaking system and very imbalanced late game scaling, the story is lacking and told in a boring way, the dungeons and bosses are disappointing, the materials you get are generally not that useful, etc.
The thing is, none of those really matter, because they aren't bad enough that they ruin the things that are good about the game. The story is lacking but it has a cool premise and isn't that important to the gameplay. The combat has severe flaws but all of its core aspects are still fun and control well. The divine beasts and blights are disappointing compared to past dungeons/bosses, but the shrines and overworld bosses serve as replacements that fit better in the open world context. The game has many flaws but none of them are crippling.
And what the game does well is more than enough to make up for these excusable flaws. It has some of the best presentation and atmosphere in any game, period. Which I do not say lightly. The artstyle is undoubtedly beautiful, and that gets all the appreciation it deserves. The game looks incredible even on more limited hardware because the devs didn't try to make something hyper-realistic, they just made a cell shaded style that looks really pretty. Strong art direction matters more than pure graphical fidelity in most cases. There was also immense care put into details and animations of everything from Link to enemies to the environment to make it all believable (for example details like Link's visible breath in cold areas as a basic one. Details like these are everywhere when you pay attention and contribute greatly to immersion.)
The audio design is just as strong. The music is slightly contentious, but I think the criticism is largely unwarranted. I agree that the overworld themes on their own aren't great pieces of music, but it's important to remember that they should be judged in-context. The context is a game that's trying a great deal to bring to life the atmosphere of its world and also has incredibly detailed audio work put into the environment. The ambient music with long rests isn't for no reason, it's to give a chance for the sounds of nature to shine. (to allow for the ""Breath of the Wild""). Those long rests also convey a feeling of loneliness better than anything more involved ever could. And apart from those, the music is all pretty good. Town themes have great atmosphere, boss themes are exciting, etc.
The audio and visual design of this game are what makes it a work of art, and show that presentation is important. The incredible presentation of this Hyrule are what make it a compelling world that players want to explore, because being in a game world that is beautiful, immersive, and atmospheric makes that game world feel good to be in.
So what matters then is how the game lets you view the beautiful world it creates. Which it does by giving the player complete freedom in exploration. This is one of few games that seems to be open world because it's actually part of the intended experience, rather than just for the sake of it. The game doesn't try to railroad you into any of its content because it doesn't need to. It takes almost all markers off the mini map and permits you to go wherever. Which plays off of the captivating environments. You see something in the distance, think ""ooh, I want to go there"", and inevitably find plenty of things from Koroks to shrines along the way. Even if the stuff you find gets repetitive, it doesn't really feel that way, because the exploration is player driven. If you find something that you aren't interested in, you can always choose to ignore it and just go to wherever your destination originally was. This is also where the map's size helps, because it isn't just an arbitrary talking point. The vastness of the world gives the player more to see in the distance and want to explore.
This game is truly a magical experience on a first playthrough. The presentation makes the game world beautiful, and the freedom it gives means you never have to do anything if you don't want to. That combined with the complete lack of knowledge you'll have on a blind playthrough makes that first experience amazing. You can wander around, not knowing where you're going, and what's different about this game is- that's fine. There's nowhere that you need to be, only wherever you want to be.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Crimson9,12-12-2022,"Never have I played a game that does so much right AND so much wrong. For instance:

No game does overworld traversal quite as good as this one. The tutorial where you cut down a tree to create a bridge to a raft and then use a leaf to produce wind to go to the other side blew my mind.

But the rewards for traversing the overworld, other than finding shrines, are largely meaningless.

BOTW has such a wonderful physics engine, combined with such excellent array of abilities and weapons that combat is a real joy.

On the other hand, since you can just PAUSE COMBAT AND HEAL TO FULL, there is no actual threat in this game other than being one shot. Which happens regularly and isnt remotely fun.

And so on.

Ultimately, Zelda was clearly influenced by other games to evolve in a positive way. But it abandoned some parts of old Zelda that it needed here, and it also didn't take as much from other game's design as it should have. This a very, very, mixed experience. Some of the highest highs for sure, but broken or outdated game design in other ways.",7,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

En si, el juego es una verdadera revolucion en mecánicas, uso de físicas, mundo abierto inmersivo, ambientación preciosa pese a limitaciones de hardware.

""Breath of the Wild"" é realmente um sopro de renovação para a franquia Zelda. Não que ela precisasse porque os jogos sempre foram, no mínimo, bons jogos. Mas o que foi feito aqui, meus amigos e amigas, é uma obra de arte de cair o queixo!!!

A maneira pela qual o jogo te fornece suas habilidades e te coloca em contato com o mundo aberto faz com que não existe um lugar de Hyrule que não desperte sua curiosidade! Os elementos clássicos e característicos da série foram reintrepretados de uma forma extremamente inovadora! O combate é fluído e continua sendo explorado por jogadores de longa data mesmo cinco anos após o lançamento! Tudo em ""Breath of the Wild"" impressiona, é o tipo de jogo que a gente fica bolado quando acaba porque não queria que acabasse...

E, para mim, o melhor desse jogo está em sua história. A forma como a narrativa se desenvolve e a busca pelas memórias perdidas permite que a gente reconstrua a história de Hyrule na medida em que nos apegamos aos personagens durante a jogatina. É simplesmente fantástico!

Eu sinto pena das pessoas que por ventura passem por este plano sem ter a oportunidade ou o privilégio de experienciar ""Breath of the Wild"". E esse é o maior elogio que posso fazer.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Pedro21608,22-11-2022,"Review em Português Brasileiro.

Desde seu lançamento esperava anciosamente para jogar este lindo jogo. Em 2019 pude desfrutar do me atual jogo favorito de todos os tempos, e sem dúvidas pra mim ele merece esse prêmio. Após 200 horas de jogo e ter zerado o game 2 vezes venho lhes apresentar meu review sobre The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild Não preciso nem dizer que esse jogo foi feito com muito carinho, e podemos perceber isso de forma clara em sua trilha sonora, mapa gigantesco com 100% de fator exploração, mecânicas divertidas e funcionais, puzzles incríveis e muito bem planejados e etc.

Gostaria de ressaltar como esse jogo preza muito pela liberdade de poder zera-lo da forma que bem entender. Esse é o jogo menos linear que ja joguei em toda minha vida, você tem um mapa gigantesco pra explorar, e 100% desse mapa é bem aproveitado com segredos, puzzles, coletaveis e além de belíssimos cenários impecáveis que demonstram o quão lindo esse jogo é, além de suas trilhas e músicas que foram planejadas de uma maneira incrível. Todas as músicas desse jogo são impressionantes e muito boas de se ouvir. Toda a saga das divine beasts instigam o jogador a ir atrás da história daquele local onde ela se encontra, onde temos npcs com história e que realmente passam uma impressão de uma comunidade viva.

Poderia falar muito mais desse jogo, realmente impecável, e digo que vale muito a pena comprar o switch só por este jogo. Você vai se divertir e se emocionar por centenas de horas, pode ter certeza.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

The amount of fun exploits and tricks, make thisbgame easy to go back to. It has arguably the best tutorial in gaming history, and rewards you for exploring. The game is designed to keep you with a constant stream of challenges, cool things to see and do, with weapons. Weapons may break a lot, but never do you run out unless you try to run out. And the weapons you get are always upgrading as you progress. To think a game this big is so, surgically designed makes thisna joy to play. Tje issuesni have lie in tje bosses, especially the last one, but specifically the last ohase of the last boss. UGH. It doesnt take away from the experience too much though.

QUIICKCLAW,13-12-2022,"An excellent open world to explore, filled with interesting shrine challenges, fun puzzles to ponder and interesting characters to encounter. The physics-centric gameplay found both in the world and shrines is also extremely enjoyable to experiment with as well.

Breath of the Wild's approach to open world design is a breath of fresh air when compared to many of the other open worlds that litter the AAA scene that often are lacking in content and meaningful reasons to explore.

Some negatives I cannot overlook with Breath of the Wild, however, are the lacking ""dungeons"" found in the Divine Beasts. The ""samey"" interior design and relatively uninteresting boss designs stick out like a sore thumb when compared to the (usually) intricately designed dungeons and wildly varied bosses of the series' previous entries.

Yuulfuji,19-01-2023,"A masterpiece of a game and a must-buy for any switch owners. The game gives you unlimited freedom, with you being able to go to the final boss straight away if you wanted to. The world never feels dull, small or empty, making the map very fun to explore. The story can feel a little lacking at times, but is sort of bittersweet and has a good plot.
10/10.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
YuNuSeMrEcAkIr1,26-01-2023,"The world design of the game is amazing, you discover new things wherever you go.a game that doesn't limit you.The story is classic, but you immerse yourself in the atmosphere and the story as you follow the story in the world of the game.

Jarkob,31-01-2023,"Die Grafik ist für Switch Verhältnisse sehr gut und auch die Steuerung so wie die Story gefallen mir an diesem Spiel sehr,
Nur die 4 Hauptdungeons sind nicht so gut wie ich es gerne hätte. Sie sehen sich zu ähnlich, sind nicht sehr anspruchsvoll und die Bosse sind alle gleich. Sonst ist das Spiel aber eine 9 von 10, hoffe der Nachfolger macht die Minuspunkte weg.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
Forcela,29-01-2023,"Uma verdadeira obra prima, diferente de qualquer jogo que já experimentei, o jogo contém uma magia própria e o mundo parece sempre muito vivo. A história é excelente, personagens marcantes e inúmeras possibilidades de gameplay. A liberdade oferecida pelo jogo é algo que nunca havia experienciado, não existe uma forma errada de se resolver um problema. A dificuldade não é das maiores, mas também não é o foco do jogo, os puzzles e inimigos oferecem uma dose balanceada de desafio.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

It is an adventure of a lifetime and I have squeezed over 230 hours into this game and plan on many hours to come. The gameplay is fun, the story is so cool and the game gives you what feels like endless options to mess around with. I mean you can ride a damn Grizzly bear which makes this the most outrageously good games of all time.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

fogmann,01-02-2023,"This game is near-perfect from the countless ways to fight enemies to the endless dungeons and collectibles. The combat is refreshing and infinite.

If I could ask for anything more, it would be the story, for me, the story is kind of blank, you only really pick up on it while doing the Devine beasts or after beating the game, I also wish the DLC’s were made free, I don’t like how you need them to upgrade the master-sword, this feature sounds like a core game mechanic.",8,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

I've given this game 10 chances to redeem itself over the years and I never got what the hype behind it was. i die constantly and the map is incredibly small, they hint that you can reach the castle but you die when you go off the platue?? also the shrines are inactive and I can't progress. worst game of the year",2,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

uninteligible,03-02-2023,"an expertly crafted open world that pioneered gaming as we know it. when you first step out of the shrine of resurrection, you can see just how far the world goes, you feel such an overwhelming sense of excitement unmatched by any game before or since. from the mountainous peaks of the Hebra region, to the rolling hills of Akkala, and everywhere in-between you can feel how well crafted the game is. but that isn't all, even going hunting for truffles in the woods, then making some food feels so polished that you could spend half an hour doing it. my only problem with it was that it deviated from the Zelda series and it's well thought out progression system.",9,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC

Jbijman,09-02-2023,"One of the best videogames on the history, free gameplay, good graphics for the nintendo switch, good history, after completing the main missions there are many things to do, and, many weapons, many armor and clothes, Bosses that are complicated, but without excessive stress,many many enemies, and different ways to defeat them, npc with interesting stories and a world from which to get theories, a bad thing are the bugs and glitches, the first are 50/50 in my oppinion, because there are some that are funny that happen, and well, glitches that a player who has been playing for a long time has done, and not infrequently, something that is not completely bad, allows the player to obtain things in a satisfactory way, but illegal , which for me is not good or bad, although the errors that ruin you obviously should not be let go, but for me, this is the best video game in history, let's see if its sequel lives up to it.",10,ZELDA BOTW,METACRITIC
