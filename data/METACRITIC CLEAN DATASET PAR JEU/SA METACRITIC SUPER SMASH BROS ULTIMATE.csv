Sensoker,09-12-2018,"Finally a Super Smash Bros game that has a extremely fast gameplay since Melee.
It has a lot of content for both casual and competitive players. FURTHERMORE, it is the most balanced smash game ever.
Online is trash but I am sure they will fix it.

BEST SMASH GAME EVER",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Arma15,07-12-2018,"The best super smash bros. Starting with the story, the adventure game, having to unlock one by one all the players, the new feature of having spirits, it’s the best. The only thing I would change is the same of all the switch games, I don’t understand why they’re not able to use the touch screen, ir would be easier to select players/spirits and I would have given a little more protagonism to spirits, as giving an specific power as summoning a thunderbolt pushing a button every x seconds or something that is more visible, since it feels a little bit abstract the power and how it affects the game, however the game is still perfect.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
felipenavarro92,07-12-2018,"Absolutely perfect! The last Smash Bros that I played was the 64 version, and everything is great on this Ultimate version, lots of characters, stages, soundtracks... graphics are very good, as much as the ultimate blows.

Melee: More complex and faster game than N64
Brawl: Slower game rythm..bad (Project M was a must have)
Smash 4: Better.. but low content
Ultimate: The Best.

Nintendo has achieved the best Smash Bros ever created, but it seems that they have not been satisfied with just that, they have also created one of the best games in history, wich will talk about it in the following years.

It not only celebrates Nintendo but gives everyone a chance to shine, from Mario to Simon Belmont from Castlevania to King K Rool the villain of the original DK games. The gameplay after 20 years is at its best. It combines every Smash game in some way, wether that be every character returning, a fine selection of 100 plus stages from all 4 previous games, master class music pieces, a fun and addictive single player adventure mode and many many more hours... days... months worth of content.

EpicLadySponge,07-12-2018,"At the time of 3DS and Wii U's release, you thought that they would stop making more games for the franchise especially if that hype for said installments was a blast, but of course Nintendo thinks you're wrong since they can obviously do a lot better and bigger than said installments. The result is a game that has so much everything that not even the word everything can be compared to the amount of everything Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has. The best part about that is that they all feel ambitious to the point where it is impossible to determine where to start your journey. Nintendo has not only created the most enthusiastic and magnificent Super Smash Bros. game in history's namesake, but they have also managed to make it one of the greatest video games in whatever timeline you are living. I usually do not ask people to play games or watch movies as if I was forcing them to do it, but when you're talking about one of the biggest games of possibly all time, you know I have no choice and I will not resist such a game that deserves all the praise I can give it. Please look forward into getting this game and playing it especially if you do not have a Nintendo Switch.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
thaesino,07-12-2018,"I can't fault this game anything. Oh wait, wait. I can, and for that I give it 9.9999999999998/10

They forgot to add the Aquatic Ambience (DK), Fi's Gratitude (LoZ:SS), and Kapp'n's Song (from New Leaf) to the Audio Vault... and also, just because the Wii U version had it, Ballad of the Wind Fish (LoZ: LA)

If you are looking for a fighting game that isn't 100% about ""serious fighting"" (BandaiNamco, Koei, and Capcom are in charge of that, and I guess Warner Bros., too these days), but a fighting game that has more features than any other fighting game (yes, even more than Mortal Kombat X with its gimmicky faction war), then look no further.

I was expecting a rehash of the Wii U version, you know, with maybe a couple of features, just like Mario Kart 8 and Splatoon 2. I was thinking, I'm sure they'll add more stuff as DLC.

No, guys. Nintendo has brought it all in, in a $60 package. Everything is already here, and as they said, ""Everyone is here!"" It is insane the amount of content this game has, especially when one thinks about how other companies handle content these days. And even with all that, there are 5 more committed DLC packages to be released for the next few months, each bringing one new fighter, as well as other smaller items.

I wanted this to be a spoiler free review, mostly because I truly appreciate the developers and companies that, in their own way, fight back these megagiants who continue ripping us off with microtransactions and ridiculous disc-locked content. And I appreciate this game as much as I appreciate something indie, like Stardew Valley, Dead Cells, and Into the Breach (with all their content at their respective base prices), and something not-so-indie, like Witcher 3 or the Disgaea series.

Either way. If you enjoy these brawlers, this one won't disappoint... for like 4-5 years to come, or more, if you're into the ""pro scene.""",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Sandman83,07-12-2018,"Best fighting game ever made by far. Awesome game with all the greatest characters in gaming all in one package. It got everything you could ever wish for like adventure mode, spirit mode (challange mode) etc. If you don't love this you are not a gamer.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
SameOldCJ,07-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is really disappointing. When it was first announced, I felt it would be one of the best 2018 games. However, when I saw it at the E3, it let me down.

The new fighters, like Daisy, Isabelle and Chrom, are nothing interesting with the exception of King K. Rool, Inkling and Ridley. No new 3rd-party characters neither, which is why there's a huge fandom of this series and, anyway, their requests are not taken in account.

My most disliked announcement was the new Assist Trophies. People felt disappointed when Waluigi was an AT once again. In my case, I really felt depressed when I saw Bomberman was one too. I mean, really? An Assist Trophy? Since the announcement of Super Bomberman R as a launch title for the Switch, both Smash and Bomberman fans determined it was time to include him as a playable fighter in the next Smash, not something else. Even notable personalities and brands agreed with it. There are a lot of reasons of why he deserves it much more than the current 3rd-party characters such as Wario Blast!, the series in every Nintendo platform, the Mario Party series developed by Hudson Soft, etc. Is this a joke? Even though both Bomberman and Hudson Soft had a long relationship with Nintendo, they just gave him mere respect.

Going on with the Assist Trophies, this feature really ruined more 3rd-party characters. Later, they announced Ashley, Isaac, Knuckles, Krystal, Shadow, Shovel Knight, Starfy and Zero as AT's as well, despite being requested by fans too. What? Why the overuse of this Assist Trophy thing? I thought Smash accepted relevant characters like those as fighters but no, looks like in a very different way.

The 3rd-party characters are disappointing too. Bayonetta is not a very notable series as others. So why is she here once again? She doesn't deserve to be in a crossover fighting game like this. Nobody requested her. Hideo Kojima, who I don't think is great, asked Nintendo to include Solid Snake to Brawl. He left Konami and wasn't included in 3DS/Wii U but is here again. And later, they announced the only new 3rd-party character: Simon Belmont. So why did Konami re-add a character whose latest game was hated by the Internet media and fans and one whose series is dead since 2014. Bomberman is the only current notable series owned by Konami thanks to the success of Super Bomberman R. Nonetheless, Bomberman is less important than Metal Gear and Castlevania? Just because they're overrated it doesn't mean he doesn't deserve to be playable. Bomberman is a more iconic and original video game character for both casual and hardcore gamers than Snake, Bayonetta, Ryu, Cloud and Simon. He is just like Mario, Sonic, Mega Man and Pac-Man. The problem is that Konami doesn't know how to treat him. He was much better with Hudson Soft instead.

Even some of the 1st-party characters are disappointing. Daisy is just like Peach and could better fit as a skin for her and not as a separate character. The same with Dr. Mario: you still treat him as a different character apart from Mario even though he is a clone of him. That's absurd. He is just Mario wearing a doctor suit. Why didn't you add him as part of his interchangeable skins? Also, why are there a lot of Fire Emblem characters? Most of them are echo fighters or clones. Even Zelda and Kirby have more legacy and popularity than Fire Emblem and they don't get a new character at least. And Wario still has his boring WarioWare style instead of the more appreciated Wario Land one.

The game doesn't have so interesting features. The new story mode, World of Light, is repetitive and nothing like the Subspace Emissary, whose removal was due to a pointless reason. How they made all of the Final Smashes automatic and the addition of more Echo Fighters and clones is worthless. All this make this game look like a Deluxe version of the 3DS/Wii U game rather than a new game.

Moreover, another disappointing thing was the new Spirits thing, which took off the possibility to even more characters like Rayman, Shantae and, once again, Bomberman. This new Spirits feature messed the crossover style of this game up a lot, together with the Assist Trophies.

To end up, I totally dislike this game. I don't deny I had my hopes to it but I do say this game screwed itself. I learned you don't have to expect anything good about it like requesting your favourite characters to appear in it. If they do, they will most probably end up being and AT or a Spirit, but not playable. I will never play nor have interest in Super Smash Bros. ever again. This game is the major disappointment of 2018 and one of the main reasons why the Switch isn't as cool as it was in 2017. I would rather play with the characters I like in their respective franchises than in a crossover fighting game like this.

Thank you, Nintendo. Just go and take care of your other IP's and make this entry the last one of its series. Super Mario Odyssey is way better than this.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The online conection is not good to even consider that now is paid connection that is even worse than before and that the matchmaking hardly does what you want, also Spammers and Campers is just not fun But apart from that it still to yet to say is worse than prequels so for now it's a 9

Uniscion,18-12-2020,"Ive been playing smash since 64, all the way up to now, and I was frankly quite good, by the time Wii U came around I had no one around who could compete, and while the online wasnt perfect, it was still responsive enough

But this game? This game breaks my heart. I just want to play smash at a high level, but this horrid input delay and methods makes the game basically unplayable online. No longer is it about quick response time, no longer is it about out maneuvering your opponent. There is only one true tactic to this online dumpsterfire of a game: predicting the future. Its the only way. You have to hard read EVERYTHING, and even if you do,, theres a 90% chance you'll get a missed input because of a lag spike that failed to register your command. Ive never played a smash game this frustrating,,if youre gonna make it be online, make it playable, or else youll end off with former fans who just want to stop playing entirely because it simply doesn't feel good to play. The amount of free hits my opponent got because the shield doesn't pop up when I press the button is absurd. Fix your game, learn from these mistakes, please.

Owen76287,10-02-2021,"This is the PERFECT Smash game. This review is being made during the Sephiroth update, just to make sure nobody get upset because I didn't mention a newer DLC fighter.

Smash Ultimate is the biggest Video Game crossover of all time. Fighters come from Zelda, Metroid, Xenoblade, Mario, FFIIV, Minecraft, Arms, Splatoon and more.

Controls for the game are supreme. I use a GameCube controller, but a Pro Controller is also a good option. A,B,R,L,ZR and the right stick all function the same as they did as standard controllers in Melee.
Controls can be easily customized just as they were in previous games.

There's easily at least 3 time the amount of stages that Smash for Wii U contained. You can find stages from past games and newer stages from Ultimate.

Certain fighters are improved upon as well. For example Ganondorf, Now uses a sword, extending his side smash range and power.

World of light is also an amazing experience, especially if you're a lonely nerd without friends like me. The fights are fairly easy in WOL, but my only major complaint is length and the time it takes to unlock fighters.

SSBU is one if not the best fighting game on the switch with lots of characters that you can chose to play versus a CPU, friend or random online. There are the most iconic characters in this game like Mario, Link, DK, Samus and much more. Thereis a story that looks interesting and it can help you to understand the controls of the game. Even if it looks easy to understand the controls its really hard to master them and thats why you will keep playing the game. I see lots of people that start playing Smash and ask me ""who is the strongest character?"" there is no strongest character,you just need to like them to play them good with obliviusly some practice, practice makes perfect. So should you buy for 70$ SSBU? Yes if you want to have some fun with friends!",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Vegisgod,15-07-2022,"It is not called Ultimate for any reason. Its Ultimate because they found the perfect combination of speed, movement, spacing, balance with characters (for the most part) and everything else. This game is the culmination of a fantastic team and a director who really cares about the product. This game is just the perfect refining of a game. As a big Melee fan, i absolutely love this game. When Brawl first came out almost everyone I knew was pretty disappointed with how slow it felt, the character roster, and other letdowns (tripping we remember you).

This game has every character from all smash games and then they even went above and beyond putting characters in that we thought we would never see like Steve (minecraft), Sephiroth (FF7), Ken (Street Fighter), Sora (Kingdom Hearts) to name a few of the mind-blowing characters. The game feels good, and you still able to use your Gamecube controller with the adapter they released for the Wii U being compatible. Not only that but almost all controllers work on this console and work well with smash. I sometimes use the 8bitdo controller / sometimes the Switch pro controller depending on my mood.

The amount of great music this title holds makes it a library that you can just chill out to and use the music player to listen to it. Its like you got a bunch of albums of music just for free along side a fantastic fighting game.

This game set a lot of standards that make it almost impossible to follow up on. I feel almost bad for any other fighting game trying to compete. But it seems a lot of fighting games are trying to follow the same type of style but most have been a letdown with the content, the tight controls and the overall polish.

This game has all of that and more. It has so much to offer that this is the only game you really need on the switch and you can have unlimited fun. The grassroots community for smash is huge so you will be able to find a tournament no matter where you live as people hold this game up to the competitive standard you would never expect.

While the online isn't at it's finest and requested characters didn't make the game, that doesn't make it a bad game. Echo fighters isn't a big deal, so stop complaining. there was no subspace emissary because the fans released the cutscenes on the internet- the fans led their own downfall. world of light is fun to play and is a great, underrated part of the game. I'm not supporting spirits or the new classic mode, but this is a great game, and i feel like it is getting negative reviews for the wrong reasons. this is an epic game, one of the best to have on the switch, and many of the changes were made for the better. this game was made for the real players. i can understand if you don't like classic mode or the online, but you can't even call yourself a real gamer if you didn't like this. all you salty noobs can play brawl with items on in norfair for all i care. stop dissing this epic game that most of you negative reviewers haven't even played.

No es un juego perfecto, pero se acerca muchísimo, no solo por el contenido desorbitante, sino también por la sólida jugabilidad que ya es característica de la serie.

KingMikeX,12-12-2018,"If this is Sakurai's last Smash Bros game he went out with a bang. The new adventure mode, World of Light, is the story mode many people wanted. It had a simple but great story, some fun and sometimes overly frustrating challenges, and had some challenging battles. I was a big fan of how we unlocked characters in this game and I some of the newcomers had very interesting play styles that I instantly grew a liking towards. Also, I was in shock and awe over the new classic mode and how each character had a different route they take where each one had different enemies and bosses to fight. There where a lot of callbacks and I love some of the new bosses which I will not go into but they are a lot of fun. Overall this is the best smash bros game to date.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Gaxeiro,12-12-2018,"Impresionante en casi todos los niveles, llevo jugando desde el lanzamiento y cada vez me abruma más el contenido de este juego.
La jugabilidad está trabajadísima y se nota el lavado de cara de todos los personajes, sus sets y sus escenarios. Se aproxima a Melee, pero bien sea por nostalgia o por excelencia, no creo que vuelva haber un Smash igual.
El multijugador es donde tiene el lunar... En modo local es impresionante, y la forma ideal de jugarlo, sin fisuras, entretenido, muy ajustable y frenético. Ahora bien, Nintendo tiene que hacerse mirar sus servicios online (por los cuales ahora pagas), ya se cargó la experiencia en juegos como Mario Tennis Aces y ahora cojea por la falta de filtros y las caídas regulares... Es jugable, pero a un título así con aspiraciones al competitivo se le queda corto este servicio online.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

However, there are some missing modes many smash fans will know including, stage builder and stadium modes. A new adventure mode, World of Light, is also in place including a variety of challenges and some amazing boss battles. Although it is great in many ways, it starts to get repetitive after some time.

the online matchmaking system works in theory but it's executed poorly in a crappy way, and the input lag isn't really noticeable by a normal player but more skilled ones will surely notice it. of course, both of these are probably bound to change in future updates to the game, so a 9.5 is more than deserved",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

joacoandresen,12-12-2018,"Hands down the best casual fighting game of all time. Oh, did I say ""casual"", indeed, Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a rare breed, a fighting game that's accessible. Today most fighting games such as Street Fighter and Tekken are very difficult to get involved in do to the competitive scene, however Smash has both great competitive and casual aspects.

For the competitive scene the mechanics are great and ultra polished, it may not be as fast and solid as Melee but it's close. This game makes sure that the competitive aspect of smash doesn't get lost like brawl did.

And for the casual side, Ultimate is huge. A massive roster, more than a hundred stages and more items then ever, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is pure gold for those who are looking for a great multiplayer game.

My only complain is the online, as usual Nintendo games have a tendency to dissapoint in this department, and Ultimate is not the exception. When I choose to play a 1v1, I expect to play a 1v1 instead of a three or four player match. In my opinion the Wii U game handled this aspect in a better way.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Snoober,12-12-2018,"First of all, I will start out by saying this; DO NOT believe anyone here who is giving this game a zero out of 10 score. Anything below 7 is absurd, and probably being done by butthurt Sony fans trying to rain on Nintendo's parade here.

With that being said, I will say that Ultimate is the greatest Smash Bros. since Melee with ease (given more time with it, I may even come to terms that it surpasses it). Everything about Super Smash Bros. Ultimate lives up to the name; there are over 70 characters, 100 stages (each of which has a Battlefield and Final Destination layout choice), and 800 tracks (which can be listened to even when the console is sleeping) to choose from, leaving an endless array of match combinations for fans to enjoy. Trophies have been replaced with pictures of characters (all of which dwell not only into the history of Nintendo, but also the likes of Capcom, Square, Konami, and more), known as Spirits, and there are well over 1000 for gamers to collect. These Spirits are the central point for the story mode, World of Light, which pits Kirby surviving an all-out massacre of every Smash character. It is then up to him to save them in a map reminiscent of a Super Nintendo overhead RPG title. Characters you battle on the map have spirits attached to them (for example, there is a battle where King K. Rool has the Spirit of a Snorlax and literally is giant and doesn't move). Along the way, you will gain many spirits that will give you an advantage as the story progresses (don't worry if it sounds confusing, there is an auto-equip setting that will give you the best suitable spirits before each battle). The story mode is also pretty long as well (we're talking 24+ hours, and that would be rushing). Classic Mode, All Star-Mode, and a couple others are here as well, so there is a lot to dive into single player-wise.

Ultimate (like all Smash titles) shines in multiplayer. There have been QOL tweaks that really boost the overall experience before battles, with the rules being displayed first (you can even save your own set, which is really a lifesaver for those of us who invest countless hours into multiplayer). Stage selection is then shown before characters are selected, which can alter the strategy a little bit. Every stage now supports up to 8 players (after 5 it gets hard to keep up with the action IMO). There is also a new mode called Squad Strike, in which each stock you have remaining is a different individual character (think of it as an elimination match). Online has been given a giant overhaul this time around, with match-searching criteria added in to make this the easiest game yet to find opponents who want to smash the same way you do. Online is really great this time around, so I recommend you experiencing it for yourself without me spoiling it too much.

What I love so much about Ultimate is its refusal to hold the player's hand, unlike many modern Nintendo offerings. Whereas Brawl felt geared toward the casual audience and, Smash 4 felt like a mix between Melee and Brawl, Ultimate feels like it completely cold-shoulders the casual at points and welcomes the hardcore. This is noticeable from not only the CPU strength (Lv 3 in this game is equivalent to Brawl's Lv 7, easy), but also in the combat, which is where Ultimate absolutely gleams. The combat gameplay and physics are extremely close to Melee, with hits feeling harder and gameplay much faster than 4. These updates are welcomed by not only the competitive, but those who felt as if Nintendo abandoned them with Brawl. Sure, 4 was definitely an upgrade, but not near as much as this. I strongly consider Ultimate as the spiritual successor to Melee in every sense of the word. With that said, I be no means am implying that this is ONLY a game for the core audience; Ultimate is a blast for EVERYONE, but how you choose to indulge in it is strictly up to you. The casual gameplay is still there, only this time its deep enough to hook in those who left after Melee.

Super Smash Bros. Ultimate stands true to its name in every way I could have ever imagined. When Brawl was announced at E3 2006, I was anticipated beyond belief for the true successor to the game I spent so many hours with during my childhood. When Brawl failed to live up to my expectations, I was hesitant about 4. Although it was a step in the right direction, it failed to live up to the standard that Melee set. I am proud to stand here today and say that Ultimate more than lives up to the hype; it is a true sequel to not only Melee, but your childhood memories. Turning on the Switch makes me feel as if I am 12 years old again, and I have enjoyed every second of it. So let the good times roll, in the most ultimate way possible.

UPDATE: After having the game sometime, I change my score from 10 to an 8 due to the horrible online implementation.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

he110me,15-12-2018,"All in all it's mostly an upgrade over Sm4sh. The only downgrade is the online matchmaking sometimes putting you into 4 player ffa when you want 1v1, but patch 1.2 reduced that drastically.

The only thing keeping it from a 10 is the single player. While it is an improvement over Smash 64, Melee, and Sm4sh's single player, it still falls short of Subspace Emissary. The matches are fun, and the rpg elements are neat (and necessary for many of the fights, dear god!), but it lacks that sweet sweet high-production fan-fiction feel that Subspace had. There are much fewer cut-scenes, and there isn't really any interaction between the roster beyond the intro scene. That being said, it is definitely a big part of the game. I still haven't finished it and I've clocked nearly 25 hours (the map you see in the trailers is only map 1!). There are indeed boss battles, some of them very fun, others kind of easy. It's no subspace, but it's the next best thing imo.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Amazing character roster and more to come, great stages, fun gameplay for newcomers and old fans of the saga alike. It's great. Only thing that wasn't so great was world of light.

Espolosin,15-12-2018,"El mejor juego de lucha de la historia.

Tanto en diversión como en contenido Nintendo y sobre todo Masahiro Sakurai, nos han entregado lo que es el culmen hasta hoy en día del genero de lucha.

Cientos de horas para desbloquear todo el contenido que viene incluido, y cientos de horas de diversión con sus 74 luchadores todos ellos únicos y sus muchos modos de juego que harán que la experiencia sea muy enriquecedora.

En mi caso los 3 primeros días de juego ya le he dedicado 30 horas y solo he podido desbloquear el plantel al completo, que puede parecer mucho, pero eso solo es una pequeña parte del juego aun me quedan mas de 1000 espíritus por lograr, y muchas horas en conseguir completar el modo árcade de cada uno de los personajes.

No contentos con esto tenemos también el mítico modo Smash donde tendremos miles de combates con las reglas, objetos y personajes que queramos.

En cuanto al apartado gráfico esta muy bien los efectos de iluminación y texturizados, sin caídas de FPS, gameplay fluido y con una gran profundidad que si queremos refinar al máximo nuestra habilidad podemos tardar literalmente años.

El apartado sonoro es sublime, unos efectos muy cuidados y de gran calidad, y una banda sonora para recordad toda la vida con un opening impresionante que cuando lo escuchas te entran unas ganas tremendas de jugar.

Other than a few drops in frame rate online works relatively well. Takes the best parts of all the previous games and puts them into one jam-packed package of good fun. Competitively might even beat melee with how difficult it can be to memorize all the frame data for every character.

Also, my favourite game soundtrack ""Crocodile Cacophony"" from DKC2 is in it! I love battling to that track.

On top of all that, there are so many modes to play and you could sit on it for hours with the biggest smile on your face. I know from experience.

Zisis151,08-12-2018,"Fighting games these days are the biggest cash cows as most of them are polluted by scummy DLC practices, little content and small rosters. Thankfully Smash Bros Ultimate doesn't follow that path and shows how a complete game should be.

It has a roster of 70 characters (I think it's the biggest roster ever in a Smash Bros game), tons of collectibles as well as a single player mode that lasts around 15-20 hours. I also heavily admire the fact that unlike every other fighting game, this one doesn't just throw the whole roster in your face from the very beggining. You start off with just 8 character and from there you can ulock the rest by playing through the story mode. It's a key feature for me because it actually makes you feel rewarded for playing the game, something that many developers do not understand today.

The only criticism I have for Smash Bros Ultimate is about the roster. I don't want to be ungrateful towards the number of characters we get to play, but seeing 3 different variations of Mario, Samus and Link taking away slots is annoying and unfair. I'd take Pyra/Mythra from Xenoblade Chronicles 2 over 1 of those variations any day.. Octopath Traveler, TWEWY, Golden Sun, all those games could've had a playable character (NOT assist trophy) but no... Instead we get Link, toon link, young Link and fat Link. I also think there are characters who should have been skins or assist trophies instead of actual playable characters.

The game is great and worth your money, but I'll take away 2 points just for the fact that some franchises got left out for the sake of getting Mario and Zelda duplicates.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Malooga,10-12-2018,"Lets get all the bad out of the way right now - the intro song SUCKS. That's about it, everything else is more or less the epitome of Smash, if you've played any of the recent entries you'll feel right at home.

The game is PACKED with content, so value is there in spades, and if there's a Nintendo character left unrepresented by either playable characters or the new support characters (known as spirits) - then it must be the most obscure character license they own.

Literally its as overwhelming as starting a new massive open world game, just staring at the list of unlockables. It's almost too much, but Nintendo does a masterful job of layering elements and peppering in extras at certain intervals that keeps it from becoming too much of a chore to manage.

The combat is still the same, but the same for somebody not akin to Smash, that may like a more traditional ""hard-counter"" set-up like in SF, this may be a little bit of a turn off.

Not every character has fluid movement, for instance. Some feel floaty, and not as impactful. This is a far cry from something you'd see in a traditional fighter. It's not a BAD thing necessarily, but if you aren't use to it you may think Kirby is a great representation of how the gameplay works. Where as playing with a character like Little Mac leaves you feeling like you're outpacing all opponents. This is simply the nature of the game, as mobility is a big part of what distinguishes the fighters.

Overall I don't think its for everybody, perhaps the hardcore fight fans who don't squeal with glee everytime they see their favorite Nintendo (or Sega) mascots on the screen - perhaps its worth testing first. For everybody else, fork it over and hail to the king, Smash is back! 9/10",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

If you like Smash, it is a no brainer this is the Ultimate version of Smash!

When I first saw Ultimate, I have to admit I did wonder if it was a ""deluxe"" version of Sm4sh but once you have played it, you can really tell that it is its own game and while it builds on the past games Ultimate maintains its own style that plays differently compared to Melee or Sm4sh.

blobfish02,30-12-2018,"I may be fairly new to the franchise (starting and ending with Smash for 3DS before this game), but it does not take an expert to recognize an amazing game when he sees one. With a incredibly impressive roster exceeding 70 characters, an impressive stage count, and just how much love was put into it, this game warrants buying a Switch all on its own. Like all other Smash games, there is some magic seeing Link, Mario, and Pikachu duke it out in a platform fighter, and that magic is only amplified with the incredible graphics and movesets. While a few of the characters are just copies of others with minor changes, the roster is big enough that it should be impossible to complain. As for the single player content, World of Light is not meant for what many thought it was. If you try to sit down and just play through it, you are going to get bored. However, if you take it in bites and work your way through it, it will be an amazing experience. I have always wanted Skull Kid as a playable character in Smash, but I cannot be mad about him not making the cut because I get to use a spirit and play with him in that way! With well over 1,000 spirits, it is a guarantee that at least one of your favorite characters will be in Smash that way, and it is heartwarming to see.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
siyaiscool,27-12-2018,"Okay so I was reading some of the negative reviews of smash bros and some of the positive reviews of smash bros and its pretty obvious that some of the people who give it a 0/10 aren't even trying to fairly review this game and even the people who give it a 10/10, this game isn't perfect and i want to point out its flaws but most importantly its successes.

Well first the successes, the story mode which really isn't one and it was never said to be a story mode so I dont really care if it has a story or what. The ""story"" mode doesn't have much of a story or anything like subspace but i think thats what makes it really good because smash never needed a story, i mean it needs some sort of story but not one with cutscenes everywhere. Subspace was pretty cool okay but the issue i have with subspace is the levels, the levels are more like levels designed for a platformer and the smash engine wasn't made to be used as a platform game so the characters felt really clunky in my opinion, but i still really enjoyed very much and i still think that brawl is really underrated. But whatever smash bros ultimate's story mode doesn't have these platform sections but instead has matches which most people would think will get repetitive but dont for some reason, the mode starts out slow but then it gets really good, i dont really want to explain the spirits since i want you to experience them and learn about them on your own but all i can say is that they are so much better then trophies.

Next Pretty much everything else, well classic mode is really good thats what i can say, it has different paths for every fighter so its not as boring as smash 4's classic mode it's actually pretty fun. The game runs smoothly at 60fps and great resolution but i ain't gonna kiss this games but as the perfect game.

the negatives, well i dont have much to say except ONLINE....................... okay just kidding online really isn't that big of a problem if you ask me, i mean at the beginning of the games life span it was just bad but since a couple of updates it has improved SO much more so i can say the online IS OKAY not perfect it has some lag some times it NOW matches you up with your preferred rule list all the time so not that much to complain. BUt the real thing i dont like is that its disappointing that i cant think of that many thing to say that theres something wrong because there are so many little things that kinda combine into something i dont like but i cant explain this game, you may give this a 10 or a 0 but we all know that this game is just mostly a game and dont it wont change anything, this game is just a game and i just think its an 8 cant say anything about why or what but its a game that you play and it will keep you entertained for hours on end but we all know that we humans just keep each other entertained until we die, and thats the human cycle we entertain ourselves until we die and these things just entertain us the bit more and this game is nice entertainment but we all know that his game will never reach the level of lego harry potter years 1-4 and years 5-7",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

With an incredible amount of content, gorgeous visuals, amazing music and gameplay that is incredibly fun and satisfying, Super Smash Bros Ultimate is arguably the best game on the Switch and will be played by many, for many years to come. Nintendo could have simply ported Smash 4 with all the dlc, but instead they went a step further completely revamping the menus, bringing back old fighters alongside plenty of new ones, a story mode that makes unlocking characters way more enjoyable (although it may not be as interesting as subspace emissary in brawl) as well as plenty of new modes and improved online matchmaking.

Geb,24-12-2018,"Smash Ultimate is the 5th game in the Smash Brothers series, which includes many more characters than any other game in the series. Most of the new characters added were also highly requested, such as Chrom or Ridley. Classic is much better then it's ever been, due to using character based paths.

Story mode and online are the worst parts about this game.
Story doesn't have a story (but that was intentional, more time was put into improving the quality of the fights), and this was due to the story mode in Brawl being leaked, which took a lot of surprise out of the game. Online is laggy, with horrible matchmaking.

WizardOfCoke,28-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, is truly the best Smash has ever been. It's that simple this is as of today the definitive Super Smash Bros.

It as a game is both perfect for the casual player alongside those that want to play in the competitive scene, I got the game on the day of release before I took a long trip and before I knew it two hours had passed this game is an amazing time killer and I will always bring it along with my Switch as it is the perfect pick up and play game in my opinion.

Let's talk about the modes in Ultimate, well firstly there's the most obvious inclusion Smash and it's been perfected for a while now so there is very little to add as we all know what is within the Smash mode as it's been in every single incarnation of Smash.

The game mode I probably played most after Smash was Classic Mode as I felt it was the great mode when unlocking characters as well as getting used to the move sets of said characters without going into the Training mode to learn the specifics of certain moves, and for those that don't know Classic Mode has to play through a range of different battles with scenarios set up for the specific character, and after completing Classic Mode you get a new challenger until there are no more to approach of course.

Next, we have World of Light, it's a nice addition and a good time waster while I personally don't play it too much I appreciate the addition I just would've prefered a story mode similar to the one we had in Subspace Emissary.

Lastly, I want to talk about the roster and we already know that ""Everybody is here"" a total of 74 characters are in the game although you only start with 8 meaning you have to play the game a lot to unlock each one and you may do it when playing through the modes casually but it can become a chore when you're trying to unlock that one character you want to main but there are plenty of ways to unlock them so it's not a complete chore.

In all Ultimate is a must buy for any Nintendo Switch owner.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Mistahleeuhm,28-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a game where there is little to nothing to complain about in terms of content like characters and stages, and therefore is nearly a masterpiece.

The amount of content in Smash mode is pretty much what we'd use to describe as epic. there are 103 stages, a record high, and over 70 fighters, also a record high in the series. that's nearly double the amount I had when I last played smash on the Wii U (I didn't have any of that games DLC). even if most of the content is from previous installments, it still feels like a fresh, endless batch of things I've never played before.

The Smash mode isn't the only thing useful to keep anyone busy at using multiple fighters nearly at once. squad strike allows for multiple fighters to be used in one battle. Smashdown also makes for a wonderful way to be skilled with multiple fighters (as stated in the August direct.).

Out of all of the modes besides the regular Smash mode, Classic mode appealed to me the most. being much better then sm4shs classic mode where every path was just random, Ultimate's classic mode gives every fighter an assigned path which has many colorful themes to it.

World of light isn't neccasarily bad, but it could still be a lot more interesting, like having more cutscenes and stuff. but other then the story its fine.

Now for the actual problem: Online. Not only did I need to purchase the crappy online service, but I don't always get the matchup I want. for example, I pretty much always select: 7 min, 3 stock, 1v1, no items, battlefield form only, but instead, I get something like non-omega/battlefield form with items on. whenever I want to play the way I want to, I have to enter an arena with my preferred rules. And in the arena, whenever I want to change my fighter, i'm forced to wait longer for literally no reason. I REALLY hope this gets fixed at somepoint.

Besides the online, this is a masterpiece. thank you Sakurai, and the development team, for all of your hard effort put into the game. and also can't wait for Pirahna Plant.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Spiffy,30-12-2018,"Wow, what a hype train this lead to. It's amazing to think that 2019 is gonna be the series' 20th Anniversary. Anyways, I'm getting a bit sidetracked here.

This game is one of the best Smash games I ever played. It's packed full of content. Let's talk about the negatives first, the online isn't that great although they're working on it. And sure Home-run Contest and Target Smash/Blast are gone, but for me, they're just modes I play with every single character then don't visit after.

Now to the positives, oh boy where do I begin? 74 (Pokemon Trainer counting as one) characters to play as, 103 stages (soon to be 108 with the new DLC), redone Classic-mode, Spirits, an Adventure mode, etc. There are too many things to talk about in this game. Sakurai wasn't kidding when he said it's more for your buck. And there's still DLC yet to come.

Vlacter,03-03-2019,"Okay so This is my first review. I am reviewing this game in particular because when reading the negative reviews its pretty obvious that most people aren't reviewing the game fairly, including those who gave 10/10's. I LOVE this game and i don't want misinformation being spread about it.

Many reviews on here (especially the low scoring ones) are practically reviewing the characters included. One in particular says ""The new fighters, like Daisy, Isabelle and Chrom, are nothing interesting with the exception of King K. Rool, Inkling and Ridley. No new 3rd-party characters neither..."". Of course the first bit is completely opinionated which is fine but saying there were no new 3rd party characters is just plain false. Simon and Richter Belmont are brand new 3rd party characters, Snake is also a ""new"" 3rd party character to this game as they most likely still had to go through a lot just to get him in since Konami's contract would likely have expired from brawl.

I feel that their is a harsh lack of legitimate reviews so i'm going to give mine. I'd give this game an 9/10, i believe it is one of the best smash games. This is a celebration of Smash as a series and it shows. Right out of the box this game comes with the most music, characters, and stages of any game. Variety is huge and is definitely the biggest selling point of this title compared to the others. Smash 64 was a great proof of concept and the fighting is very deep. Melee took the depth of SM64 and put it on steroids. Brawl was a fighting game for the casual audience of the WII, not bad but most of the depth was taken out in favor of fun wacky mechanics. Smash 4 was a sort of return to form for the series but still leaving a bit of Brawl linger. Then came Ultimate with it's new ideas and implementation of old mechanics. This game really is the epitome of smash. I can only come up with one complaint about this game and it's a common one. The online is a bit of a mess, I think it will be fixed in the foreseeable future but at the moment it's a bit broken, with the connection problems and the preferred rules system. Other than that though, I feel this game is great in all other regards so I think i'll talk about common complaints other people have. ""It's not enough like melee."" Now I kinda get this one, after all my favorite smash game is melee, but we have to realized that melee is great because it is unique, if we got another melee that would not be good for the growth of the game. Even with that they did add new tech like directional air-dodges which allow for sudo-wavedashes and more colorful edge-guarding. ""It's a port."" Now this one I do not understand at all. I think this one is more of a thing people with out Switches say to make themselves feel better. The game has so so much content, I am much happier with what we got then a game built from the ground up that would come out a few years later with less content.

Thank you for reading my long review and hopefully it was insightful and helpful for you.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Riqyu112,30-08-2020,"Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is bad game. Ranging from the lack of original content and the infamous online, you would be better of playing any of the previous Smash Bros. games.

The ""story"" mode is nothing but walking from place to place on a map just to abuse one powerful spirit build for the entire game with no punishment. The only challenge comes from either purposefully raising the default difficulty so the spirits can avoid one more hit than usual or the bosses and the overpowered spirits that are harder than the true final boss fight, where you have three chances with your best characters as opposed to Pauline, where you have one chance to fend off three fighters who are better than you. Unlocking the other playable characters is an absolute joke when you've just fought a spirit that's offered you your own head on a silver platter.

Classic mode isn't much better. While the references are fun to puzzle out, you might just be better off playing with friends since they won't be able to use frame perfect inputs on you.

The online modes are notorious for their lack of balance, and I shouldn't even have to comment on how unbalanced the GSP gain/loss rates are. Characters are wildly unbalanced and unless you're willing to study game mechanics or throw away any shame you have, you'll be bullied by everyone else playing.

The best parts about the game are the reveal trailers which are full of life and effort and tricked me into believing the full game would be as well.

I would recommend anyone steer clear of this game and play Brawl or 64 instead. Hell, play Skullgirls if you want a good fighting game, fun characters and animations make it a better experience in my opinion. The dozen characters Skullgirls have are better than the 80+ Smash Ultimate has to work on.",3,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The story was very disappointing and the online need a lot of work. But Sakurai did say that the team was gonna work on the online as time goes on so that's one thing to look forward to. One thing that I'm pretty sad about is that nintendo does not support competitive smash like other companies do for their games. The tournaments that Nintendo organize are mostly casual tournaments.(meaning items on, smash meter, all stages...) For those who don't get it, in competitive smash, we try to limit the luck factor in a match. And some stages are so big that a character with good mobility could get the lead and run away for the rest of the match. Witch is really boring so that's why we have stages called legal stages.

FNaF,07-12-2018,"Ever since Nintendo release the Nintendo Switch, I always want to play a Super Smash Bros game on the console & now I'm planning to get this for Christmas this year",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Protomario,07-12-2018,"For this review, it’s going to be mostly just be showing simple matches that would not spoil the game, this game is massive, probably one of the only games many people will buy this year alone.
For this reason, I just want to review the game itself and not spoil the game for anyone.
As always, I will be reviewing this game with the five pillars of gaming –

Graphics, Gameplay, Sound, Story, and controls.

Let’s begin with the story –

So, this magical force has come to steal the souls away from all the smash fighters making them, “Spirits”

These spirits will come into play later, but essentially the single player story mode is the player taking on and slowly taking back all these spirits in a climactic final battle with the bad guy.
It’s extremely simple, but a good vessel to push a reason why you are fighting multiple of the same character, or an evil version of Mario, or how to get all these spirits without fighting the same battles over and over again.
Small tweaks on the conditions of victory make it a nice story mode, but a basic one.
Not why you bought Smash Bros. to begin with.
Nintendo are all about those call backs though, and you’ll see that immediately when you begin playing the simple, yet extremely deep, smash battles that you can create.

This is where the story will transfer into game play, where you can play 1 on 1 skirmish styled matches with any number of rules under the sun.
From bombs being the only items to competitive level rules of final destination only no items, fox only.
That is the beauty of this fighting game, you can take Nintendo’s original 8 fighters, and battle them to the death.

Donkey fighting Pikachu because he thinks the yellow mouse is a banana, Mario beating up Yoshi for tax evasion, everyone is here.
Everyone that you are willing to unlock that is.
If you have never played Smash Bros. before, it works like this.
The game usually begins with a limited set of Characters, requiring you to then complete certain challenges, battles, modes to then unlock the chance to battle these new characters to play with.
But how does this game differ from other fighting games?
Simple

Instead of having an HP system in many fighting games, this has a percentage level, the higher it goes, the easier it is to be knocked out of the stage.
Being knocked out of the stage counts as a loss, which would be something the player wants to avoid while actively attempting to defeat those around them.
To accomplish this, you do what the game’s title implies, you smash…

No, not that type of “Smash”, this isn’t Netflix and chill.

Smash bros require you to battle it out for victory, first one to smash the opponent off the stage wins, put simply.

With varying conditions like time and life stock, it’s a fairly simple concept, yet effective fun game play.
This game is crisp, clean and a real treat –
Graphics

I have no tested this game for its frames, but it would be difficult to say that it is not smooth or nice to experience in any way.
The frames never dropped on me, and felt like a constant 60 FPS, while retaining graphics that were even better than Smash Bros on the Wii U, and that was full HD smash as well.
I honestly didn’t think it could get better, and yet, it did.
The clean visuals mixed with a solid frame rate breathe beauty and refinement that a PC gamer would drool over.

From the deep blacks, to the crisp Mario bright colors, it’s a real beauty.
But the many series were done right, no series looks poorly done, all character models look rendered properly, the game series here all look and sound great.

Speaking of the sound, those sound effects are all present, from the coin to Pac-man’s chomp, it’s all here. And the music is outstanding, every series sounds on point, if a bit better in my opinion.
Classic songs make appearances along with their respective game series, with the ability to hear their songs while duking it out with these legendary series, it makes for a great feeling.
Nostalgia is extremely strong with this music combined with the sound effects, really making this a joy to listen to while playing. You can control all aspects of sound and music in this game to your content.
The Switch is no stranger to multiple control schemes, from the pro controller to the joy-cons, you can play this game your way. This game is accessible to almost anyone, with simple controls that are easy to master, these controls allow you to get batter if you desire to be the best, while retaining the simplicity of Smash. The combo’s you can do, the charge attacks, the special moves, all of them are very easy to learn and use with the given buttons on the controllers. Be it in handheld mode, to using the Joy-cons, the game works great for anyone new or well versed to the series. Anyone who has never played Smash bros, if you have a Switch, you need to buy this game and play it.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Because of its massive crossover when it comes to the diverse roster and stages that may want you to spend the whole time unlocking. The gameplay never fails to a certain extent and Sakurai made an effort for fans to play it for the sole purpose of fun which he delivered well. The biggest flaw in Super Smash Brothers Ultimate is that Waluigi isn't even a ""PLAYABLE"" character which is absolutely disappointing and tear dropping because that was one major request that players wanted.

I'd like to remind users to be fair with their reviews. We all know what 0-5 games look like and lets be real... Smash Ultimate falls far from that realm.

My experience with the smash universe is limited to SSB4 and now this installment. So far it seems to be a wonderful improvement.

It is the best Smash has been since Melee. It is similar to Smash 4 but if you haven't noticed all of the improvements, you haven't played the game. This is not Smash 4.

MiddleDark,08-07-2020,"Super Smash Bros Ultimate is a collection of all the characters from past previous titles and then some new faces that have joined along the way with DLC. But the game is a broken mess of characters that will force you to play certain characters to just compete with others or at least stand a chance. That is a problem as you'll find yourself having to stop playing your favorite characters just so you can compete for what is the ""meta"" in fighting games. From personally experience the community is in denial about the state of the game. The single player experience is well worth it though, with hours of fun and tuns of ways you can change it up.",4,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I'm a bit disappointed, and seriously hope Nintendo will add this with the future patch.. but my hopes are weak.

Dankness99,21-12-2020,Used to seem fun. They keep adding terrible/spam riddled characters to the dlc. Online is not only laggy as heck but it has a very toxic community. I could have bought a nice noose for myself instead of buying this.,0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
DingerDonger,28-06-2020,"The good is that the game is constantly being updated with new DLC and even balance changes. There's also some okay-ish single player content if that's your thing. The game falls flat on its biggest draw, however: online play. The servers are so bad that the game is virtually unplayable in the majority of matches you'll manage to get into. Sometimes you'll even be temp banned because the game thinks you left even though the server just dropped both you and your opponent.

Now let's talk about the gameplay itself. They STILL haven't removed the buffer, which is the worst thing added to the game since tripping. The buffer makes this game unbearable to play coming from Melee. While the gameplay has been improved overall since smash4, it's still nowhere near the level that melee is. The devs have done everything in their power to limit certain styles of gameplay by making things like throws and edgeguarding far less effective than in past installments. Wavedashing was finally put back into the game but was made so useless it may as well be left out. The ignorance of the developers is pretty astonishing, honestly; Melee continues to be insanely popular with competitive crowds yet they push this floaty campy garbage gameplay in every game following it. And I don't even mind floaties or camping within the game itself, but when every matchup devolves into a snoozefest (and/or a lagfest) you know you have a turd of a game on your hands.

If you're just a casual who likes seeing your favorite game characters duke it out with items and whatever else, sure this game is a decent buy. Don't waste your time with Ultimate if you're looking for a good competitive experience, however. Play Melee or even Rivals of Aether.",2,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Jeremymaxwell,16-07-2020,"Used to be a good game, but recently I've been noticing more and more that it's becoming a more RNG based game.

CleanZodiac,15-04-2021,"My previous review got deleted and my account got banned, even though I took 20 minutes writing a review of this game, so I will try to summarize it.

First of all, the game is pretty fun if you play with items and/or don't take it seriously since it tries to aim to become a less complex and competitive fighting game, by lowering down the skill requirement for the player to actually be decent at the game by making allot of moves safe and spammable, letting players mash out of combos easily since almost every character has fast aerials and because they reduced the hitstun making it very hard to punish people who mash out of combos. Many players just spot dodge after they miss a strong attack like a smash attack and you have to mostly respect their misses since the game leaves almost no time to punish, the game should follow the high risk high reward and not just low risk high reward since so many people throw out moves but you have to respect so many moves or risk getting punished whenever you try to punish them after they whiff. The online is just terrible, people can rage quit and you gain no gsp even though they left, there is allot of lag and players who abuse it, you cant mute winning taunts which some people use to be toxic whenever they win and sometimes when a player loses connection you get banned for supposedly disconnecting from the match. Allot of characters have gimmicky moves like Luigi for example: his whole play style revolves around him spamming his tether grab that you have to dodge almost instantly or else you will probably get 0 to death by a decent Luigi and the balancing is not as bad as the other smash games but its below decent since some characters clearly dominate over other like Pikachu and some are just terrible characters with awful design like Little Mac. Honestly if you want to buy this game for fun then go ahead but if you actually want to get good and play it competitively, then I would not recommend. I wanted to add this review again because first of all, deleting and banning a person for giving a bad review to an overrated game is just unprofessional and because I liked playing smash 4, brawl and melee but I personally believe that ultimate is just allot more frustrating and just a competitively worse game (except brawl, but at least that game was personally more fun than ultimate).",4,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Kiabeta,07-12-2018,"The game is fun, but at times the game can feel stiff and clunky, and the small starting roster made it hard to get into at the beginning, World Of Light felt linear and was disappointing.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Ryzacus,25-12-2018,"Over the years I put hundreds of hours into each Smash game and loved everyone as it came out. Smash Ultimate took a bit of getting used to, but I can safely say its a fantastic game! The way sales are going Smash Ultimate may end up being the best selling version of Smash ever and even the best selling fighting game of all time. Boy is it a good time to be a Smash fan!

PROS:
The game introduces great new modes such as Squad Strike & the inclusion of tournament mode again. Visually the game is a 10/10 and is simply beautiful. The roster is huge and includes every fighter from every past iteration, so you'd needn't worry about your mains not showing up. The variety in character design this time around is great. Usually character designs are based of the latest games in the series but this time we are seeing character iterations from different games across their respected series. Example: From the Zelda franchise we see: 'Breath of the wild' Link, 'Ocarina of time' Ganondorf & 'A Link Between Worlds' Zelda. This makes the game feel like a better representation of the history of Nintendo games. New in game mechanics such as air dodging and perfect shields feel great. Stage morph is also a brilliant idea that works very well, especially in longer timed battles.

CONS:
Mechanically the game has a slight bit more input lag that Smash 4. This will not be an issue if you are just playing the game for fun but if you are a competitive player it may take some getting use to. The input from controllers can feel slightly off at times but again that might be because Im so used to Smash 4. I should add I have tried both the Pro controller and Gamecube. The Gamecube feels more accurate but personally I have never been a fan of how it feel in my hand so I stuck with the Pro controller.

The online doesn't run as smooth as you'd like unless you use a LAN cable. Unfortunately if you have a perfect connection games can still jump due to your opponent having a bad connection. This is disappointing but not much of a surprise. You can't play a number of game modes online or on local wireless either. This means no tournaments or squad strike with friends unless it's on the one system. This is not to say that online is bad, as it has never been better, but there are a number of improvements that will hopefully come in later patches.

The 'World of Light' story mode is not great. This is battle after battle with a new gimmick each fight. There is basically not much more to the story at all other that what was shown off in the opening cut scene. This leads to a story mode in which you basically grind for hours doing the same thing over and over and its long and boring. This is a a shame as what little cutscene footage there is was absolutely stunning and left me wanting way more. Seeing all our favourite characters interact is something we all wanted to see and unfortunately its not what we got. IF you love to collect spirits then you might love it but for me Im struggling to finish it.

Game modes such as 'Break the targets' & 'Home run contest' are gone. You constantly earn gold similarly to all the previous games but with a serious lack of anything to use it on. Theres no trophies & no slot machine mode leaving you with the shop to simply buy soundtracks, mii skins & more spirits Yippee...

As usual the character roster is not completely balanced. This makes a number of characters an uphill battle to win with. Out of all the Smash games however this is by far the most balanced with even heavy characters such as Bowser, Ike and Ganondorf feeling playable for the first time! We have seen 1 patch so far so there is hope for some characters to be tweeked in the future.

CONCLUSION:
Over all the game is awesome. Is it the best in the series? As a whole package I'd say no. But maybe I will eat those words with time. The games stages and characters look incredible and the game play is more fast paced than its ever been making battle feel so much fun even to spectate. Sakurai and his team had hard deadlines to meet with this game and in some regards it was clear, but what we got was nothing short of damn impressive as usual and the game is worth every penny. The story mode in particular is very repetitive and the lack of standard game modes & trophies is sad and it was all due to a lack of development time. If I was scoring based on the multiplayer mode alone I'd give the game a '9' but without some classic game modes and a slightly boring Spirits mode its an 8. I will defiantly be sinking in hundreds and hundreds of hours into Smash Ultimate and Nintendo deserves ever bit of success with it!",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Felbuddy,07-12-2018,Super Smash Brothers is one of my favorite titles for the Nintendo Switch which further justifies that 20$ for a year of Nintendo online. The graphics are fantastic and the game has significant replay value that will keep you coming back for more. Now most people may be turned off by the difficulty of part of this game however being a dark souls veteran this did not deter me from having a great time. I do plan on buying the fighter pack and playing the heck out of this game for the next few months! I highly recommend it for your switch it is definitely a must buy!,10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

IkOzael,28-03-2021,"Straight-up, I've had more fun in any past Smash Bros. game compared to this one, including Brawl.

On a casual level, it's likely the same thing you've played before, but repackaged with more on the roster, so that audience is instantly dealt with. On a competitive level though, gameplay revolves around the same defensive crap as before. On the other hand, offense can be ridiculous, especially with characters that're already fast, which forces you to camp like hell to even do good against 'em. The whole dodge penalty doesn't do ****. Lag in general is nonexistent, therefore it's usually impossible to punish anything. Grabs (except tethers) have been castrated. Character playstyles can be described in a short sentence or less. Calling this game balanced is like saying Americans have a healthy diet. This game is more anti-competitive than Brawl and just 'cause everything is ""faster"" ain't gonna change that.

The balancing is a whole other thing. I'd understand balancing ~100 characters is too much, but that's Sakurai's fault. It doesn't help that a lot of 'em are annoying as all hell with the newcomers being prime examples. There's an easy solution I call ""Roster Rotation"". Basically, cut the roster to ~40, add in the latest predictably popular characters during a Smash Bros. game's development, maybe some old forgotten ones, and make changes to veterans based on their recent games (or their home series material if you're creative).

Anyway, hitstun is worse than Brawl and the knockback doesn't help. It turns a match into a game of hit-and-run unless you play some obnoxious **** which there're a lot of in that game. Also, the controls are terrible and the retarded hold buffer just adds insult to injury.

Now, allow me to rip Spirits apart. Spirits is the biggest piece of **** outta ANY mode in Smash Bros. history. People have **** on Smash Tour (including me) for whatever reason, but I've reevaluated my thoughts on it and think it could've been fun if it was developed more than it was.

World of Light, is a tedious Events mode essentially featuring Brawl's Stickers. Spirits have no downsides other than power and type, so you just pick the strongest ones you got. Most Spirits are weaker than the high-ranked ones and are just there to waste space in the game's files. You even get the best Spirits in the game after beating World of Light although they have one of many useless traits. Until then, you just run around a JPEG map with chores scattered around it. Y'know, when you do look at those JPEG maps, they actually look interesting as stages akin to The Great Maze in SSE. The Mysterious Dimension is my favorite one. I'd take a few long, interesting, well-designed levels over the **** they actually made.

Anyway, spare me the bull**** about ""But this mode lets us fight characters that we'd never see in Smash Bros. in a million years!"". At the end o' the day, your still fighting Mario, Link, or whoever's in the game. Everything else is barely related to the Spirit in question. ""This one loves [neutral/up/side/down] specials!"", ""The floor is [lava/electrical/frozen/sleep-inducing]!"", ""This one has no reason to exist other than to waste your time!"", etc. And you can miss me like Neo from The Matrix with calling it a story. You can literally sum that **** up with ""Gotta free the Spirits! Oh, and balance the light and dark stuff!"". The retards calling it a story are the same people who would be callin' Steven Universe a flawless diamond. There's, like, 5 cutscenes compared to Subspace Emissary's +101. The first cutscene is what most people have their mouth agape over. The bosses are the only redeeming thing, but **** you if you thought there was a Boss Battles mode anywhere to be found. Thank god this wasn't what Sakurai went with in Brawl.

I could go on about this mode specifically, but this review is already long. I tried to have some kinda fun with 'em before, but that wears out very quickly with how broken they are on top of the gameplay and characters. At least with Smash Bros. 4's Character Customization, it had custom moves and the Equipment was way more balanced compared to Spirits.

The other modes ain't worth bringin' up 'cause they're the same stuff you already played and got bored with.

One more thing is online. With everything I said about the gameplay in mind, imagine how that would go down on an asswipe of a ""service"". I don't give a damn if it was a nickel, this **** should've been free 'cause that's it's true value if even that. Nintendo loves to put on the facade of caring, but they couldn't care less. Yet, their zombie fanbase will be mindless martyrs for 'em, so they'll be alright, won't they? To sum up Ultimate's online (and offline): A breeding ground for toxic jackasses which the game's mechanics promote.

There really ain't much goin' for this one. I'd easily go back to any other Smash Bros. game over Ultimate any day.",2,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

1 point taken away because the online mode (which I frankly don't really care about and won't be playing much) is terrible.

Un juego con infinitas sorpresas, desbloqueables, progresión... Es, sin duda, un claro ejemplo de juego 10.
Como pega diría que el online, al menos en el lanzamiento, no funciona del todo bien. Depende de la calidad de la conexión de todos los contrincantes.

Irarius,07-12-2018,"Ok so i already sank a BIG load of time into this and i am exhausted for today so lets give this a short review
the game is good, the combat is nice, you can pull off some amazing stuff, the controlls feel nice and the rumble lets you even feel footsteps if you walk slowly, nice touch
the different modes are nice
world of light has for what it is a good ammount of variety in the battles, so look at this as event matches, cuz that is what it is.
i also need to say that the game seems rly hard at times, i have a friend who ragequitted twice already. i myself can say that some battles tear you apart,
bossfights are also swell and have some difficulty, and well some of them will destroy you to the moon and back if you dont expect it or fight them for the first time, sometimes they can get you rly cheap but okay

now a little problem i got with the game is well mode variety could be a bit wider,
classic mode offers a 2 section but thats one section and its always the same,
no smash the target, no homerun contest ( not that i care about homerun... i rly dont)
the story mode is not offering alot of story but i guess again its a gloryfied event mode

some of the spirit battles will make you scream because of how unfair they seem or well... are.. just saying the mario super star event is rly making me mad
unlocking characters per world of light is nice, per classic rly random, and otherwise random aswell so yeah, you cant rly work for it exactly as you want",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

BL3Review,24-01-2021,"8 frame input lag in OFFLINE + removing defensive options like shield dropping and power shielding = Not a fun time.

I have never seen a fighting game (if you can even call a game with 8 frame delay offline a fighting game) remove such a crucial defensive option before. Removing shield dropping and power shielding is like removing reflect from DBFZ, removing flawless block from MK11, removing parrying from SFV, or removing BURST from Guilty Gear. You just can't do that. How are you meant to deal with characters mindlessly spamming up tilts from the platform below? Here's the answer: you don't, just jump to ANOTHER platform and hope they don't keep sharking you. Alright, how about zoners, shouldn't parrying make up for the lack of being able to reflect projectiles? Nope, it actually NERFS everyone without a reflector by giving no real option to approach than to get a stock lead and camp the zoner out instead. On top of that, the online, bare minimum, adds 4 more frames of delay on top of that on delay based netcode. Last, but not least, the meta is the most stagnant meta i've ever seen in any game besides Modern Warfare. Ever since Joker released, the meta has not shifted at all with the developers outright refusing to nerf aspects of the top tiers and instead opt to buff the low tiers in ways that don't even benefit them. As an example, they buffed Captain Falcon's side-b attack to have super armor when the move wasn't even being used, and not just because it was easy to beat out. Even after the buff it still wasn't used and they still refuse to change his ATROCIOUS backdash animation which is bottom 5 in the game. You know what they buffed instead? Palutena's up tilt and BARELY nerfed her base kit, which didn't even move her anywhere on the tier list. Combos are barely even a thing in this game too, with neutral air dodge being extremely fast and having a load of invincibility frames too, not to mention you get it back as soon as you get hit. So even if you read the DI, read the double jump, AND read a bad air dodge, as soon as you hit them again they can just spam air dodge again. Landing hits are barely rewarding at all too since 80% of the cast has insane recoveries anyway, they either surround the character in a massive hitbox that only loses to disjoints, they can recover from the very bottom from the screen without being contested, or they're able to mix it up between multiple options (think Brawl Meta Knight). On the flip side, if they jump off ledge and regrab it they lose invincibility, so you can get a free spike/punish for them doing that. The only problem with that is that they REGAIN THEIR INVINCIBILITY after being hit, so there's no risk for picking the wrong option at the ledge.

TL;DR
Removed defensive options that we're in past games for no reason
8 frame input lag in offline + 4 online minimum
Has had the same meta for 3 years and counting
Combos aren't rewarding and aren't worth the effort unless it's a TRUE combo (which is likely just 3 hits max)
Losing neutral isn't punishing

The only reason I would EVER recommend this game to anyone is if you just plan to play it casually with 3 other friends every now and then.

This game contains literally what the title says, an ultimate compilation of all old fighters of the Super Smash Bros series as well as fantastic new fighters to the game. There are so many ways to play this game from the variety of modes that it has to play and characters/stages to choose from. Squad Strike is easily one of my favourite new modes that helps keep the series fresh whilst personal favourites Classic Mode and Tourney strike me with nostalgia.

The new adventure mode took a while to get used to but I like what it brings. The RPG element of the story is a pretty cool addition and the many fights that it brings definitely gives you lots of time to consume. Personally, some more cut scenes and a few big boss fights like in Super Smash Bros Brawl would have perfected this mode. Hopefully down the track, a Boss Battle mode can be added

Overall, this game proves that fighter games can still keep up with the best and are very entertaining to play. This game is a must for those who want both a casual beat em up or a competitive fighting experience. Super Smash Bros Ultimate delivers the ultimate fighting package.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

It is great for solo or co-op play providing great enjoyment for all. The game features a character everyone will enjoy from fan favourites to characters out there for the hard core Nintendo fans. The game has a variety of game modes and difficulties for players to engage with along with some online play to boot. My one complaint however is the ramp up in difficulty that seems to come when a new character approaches, I have the game set to default difficulty and manage fine against the AI losing occasionally but mostly winning however when I come up against the challenger approaches enemies I lose a whole lot more. I do understand there should be a challenge in unlocking someone knew so it does indeed feel like an achievement however the ramp up seems extreme especially for new comers to the genre and franchise.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

If you're looking for a fun online fighter, save yourself the stupidly high price tag of this game and play an actual fighting game instead- they obviously don't care about anything apart from money or else they would make Online actually worth bothering with. And that's not even mentioning the unbelievably toxic player base who not only will ragequit at the first sign of danger (which YOU get punished for because the game will not give you any points even if your opponent disconnects AFTER they have been KO'd, with pretty much no consequence to them because the report system doesn't work) but also amongst other things vehemently defend the multiple paedophiles in the professional circuit.

GoPackGo08,06-06-2021,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is an absolutely amazing game. The gameplay is near perfect. The speed isn’t to alienating for newer players, but it’s also not too slow for very competitive ones. The character selection is immaculate, with anyone from Mario, to Sonic the Hedgehog, to Cloud Strife, to even a piranha plant. Every person I’ve played the game with has their own character. They all seem to have a special bond with that character, whether they’ve played the character’s home game, or even just like their moveset. The single player offerings are incredible in Smash Ultimate. I’ve seen a lot of people take a dump on the adventure mode, World of Light, but I think it’s amazing. So many tiny little references to hundreds of games, and really interesting strategy involved. Also, something I highly recommend is doing a World of Light Nuzlocke. If you lose a game with a character, you can no longer use them. I’ve beaten World of Light doing this twice, and plan to do it again soon. The online mode is my only small problem with this game. Occasionally, I have problems with an online opponent having a laggy connection, and the ranking system is a bit strange, but honestly I think the online mode is fairly well sculpted.

DuskZZ,14-09-2021,"As a longtime fan i was extremely excited when they announced ultimate.
A new game with a bunch of new characters, updated mechanics and stages along with a cool single player mode that we haven't seen since brawl.

Too bad ultimate was none of that, the combat and movement in this game feels extremely clunky, half the times I'm trying to do something like a tilt or even just run and pick up an item and the character will just do a smash attack without even moving.

The ""story"" mode turns out to just be a board where you can move your character and then just have normal cpu fights, an utter disappointment to everyone who thought we would get cool interactions between all these characters.

They updated every character from smash 4 and it just feels like they made everyone able to just spam anything and be completely safe cause why not make this game more braindead.

I feel like i don't even need to mention how **** garbage the online is and how even though its been almost 4 years it's still just as bad. Ir's funny how even indie fighting game developers like Mane 6 can get a way better netcode than the ""best fighting game of all time""
But of course it's Nintendo, and Nintendo can't fail even if give their loyal fans an actual turd, they'll still play with it for hours because it has a popular franchises sticker on it.

Jmaneater21,20-09-2021,I can't believe Nintendo is okay with the state of online play. Don't get for online play.,1,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
LastSmash,14-11-2021,"Online is a mess with Smash. Since we now have Smash Tags, people tend to collect and go instead of taking on a rematch. You can't select characters between matches like For Glory used to allow either.

But the worst part of it all is the banning system in place. You get banned for disconnecting, so not up to par internet is a no no. Even if you have good internet and are playing, be careful not to kick the switch out of the dock or it will ban you for that as well. There was one time when I tried to turn down the volume on my switch mid-match and accidentally pressed the power button(because they are so close for some reason) and I was banned for an hour and a half.

Though I have personally never been banned for this, you can also be banned for picking on a specific player too much in non one-on-one matches. However, there was a time when my tag partner left and I was left in a three-way free-for-all with the other two players. When we started, they went to opposite sides of the Omega stage and contained me in the middle, essentially jumping me. It was demoralizing so I put my controller down and got banned for inactivity despite my character being tossed around like a ragdoll. The only reason I stood there is because the last time this happened, I just threw myself off the stage and watched the other two players repeatedly press down aka tea-bagging before the other disqualified themselves for their ex-teammate, allowing them to win. The absolute worst part is that I got banned for eliminating myself after the match was over. I was basically subjected to sit their and watch them tea bag together for possibly 7 minutes or cut my game off and risk a disconnection ban.

I find it weird that at this point, Nintendo/Smash Bros has not found a new and common way to deal with issues like this. Why not just do what most other games do and turn a player who disconnects into a cpu? They should not be banned just because their internet isn't working properly. Just give them a loss and move on with it so people don't have to deal with the foolery of other players.

Aside that, the roster is good and gameplay is good.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I made a mistake of trying to go pro and the only thing Ihave gained is knowledge of how unbalanced this game is. It's not your typical fighting game, just a mash fest of basically which character is better, not which player is better.

A massive roster of more than 70 fighters (including every past fighter). More than 100 stages. More than 800 music tracks. A story mode. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate really earns its title in terms of content, and the gameplay is as fantastic as it's ever been. I have particularly enjoyed the Stage Morph feature (which allows you to play on multiple stages in a single match). I also like Classic Mode now being a unique experience for each fighter, as well as the creativity shown with the new ""spirits"" feature.

If I had to nitpick, I'd say that I would've preferred more new stages (only four are completely new, but the many returning stages are quite varied). Some modes from past games have been removed, but in this case, I found said omissions to not hinder the experience much, if at all.

Simply put, if you own a Switch, this is a must-buy. It may well be the best Smash yet, which is saying something for such a consistently fantastic series. I wouldn't pay much attention to those saying that this is a port of the Wii U game; Ultimate is obviously a new game and a separate experience from its direct predecessor.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Tymunster,20-03-2020,"The only impressive part of this game is the balance and the roster. I'll give them that though, That's why it isn't a 0.
The design of most characters is laughable. Characters like Ganondorf and Zelda are exceptions rather than the rule. Falco is awfully made, Ike feels like a lightweight, even Ganondorf isn't great considering how little they use from his home games.
The competitive game modes online are the worst ones ever created. Smash 4 was notorious, this is infuriating. Overwatch does a better job with competitive game modes. OVERWATCH.
I won't be fully negative, the roster is commendable and the balance is impressive. But when the best arguments are ""everyone is too strong and there's a lotta people,"" that isn't a good sign.
The DLC is also obnoxious. Not the worst in the world, but they basically force you to pay for characters that many games would call an ""update."" And they make sure to ignore everything the fanbase WANTS and give a character nobody wanted.
The design of most characters is very bad. Too much spacing, too much projectile. The fast pace of the game makes it so some characters who WOULD be sick and impressive, but it's just irritating (Fox, falco).
Athough the game cannot 100% be blamed for this the drift of the switch joycons only started getting big occuring after it came out. Just awful design of the nintendo switch there.",3,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Most fights don't require skill to defeat but rather the ""correct"" spirits setup.

I have to say although the game is meh. if you like it it's okay.
the problem i have is something else.

The only matches I could get into was 2 matches that were VERY LAGGY. I'm not talking about regular video game latency. like the frame rates doped and it froze a lil bit.

now I can't even get to another match. ""One or more consoles is not responding"" or ""could not connect to other consoles"" after waiting some time for MM to work.... it's just awful..

we're paying 25$ a year for this? 25$ a year for a server that only has basic servers? the connection method for this game is peer to peer which is embarrassing in 2019. but what's WAY WAY more embarrassing is paying monthly for peer to peer in a 60$ game in 2019",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

yesnt,19-10-2019,"quantity does not replace quality. easily the worst smash game by gameplay no contest. It comes down to luck if the game decides your move has more hitbox than your enemies. spacing isn't a thing anymore. Playing with items is less luck reliant than competitive rules. The AI is horrible. if you don't wanna play online (for good reasons) the bots are just as bad. the only time you'll get hit is by their inhuman reactions and just knowing frame by frame when to do the right thing (which is impossible by humans especially in this game) and only get hit when they do something inhumanely retarded. The online dares to sometimes fail to load at all and lag like crazy if you're not playing the guy next door, so punishing mistakes is not a thing (especially with the hitbox thing i talked about) about 1 in 20 matches are fair and balanced aka fun (which is about 19 in 20 in the other games) so whenever i win its not satisfying cause it doesn't feel like i did the thing but the game happened to let me, and losing is infuriating most of the time. The other content is the most uninteresting out of all the smash games which is sad because this game relies on them the most. Its sad that they charge 70 bucks for this game and over 20 for dlc.

Sirus,10-03-2019,"While people lower their standards due to the Nintendo brand on the box, this game is awfully balanced with many of the characters virtually worthless over others. You play the story mode to unlock more characters to play with, but you must engage in a very long, boring, drawn out mode that forces you to fight A.I.s who are able to execute special moves with no lag or hesitation meanwhile players must move their joystick in a direction and then press a button, causing a delay which creates a very skewed and unfair advantage for the computer, this is how they manage the difficulty in the game. Online gaming is painful, often times you’ll notice a lag so other player’s internet connection can keep up. The only fun to be had is turning this game off and trading it in at a game store, this was a miss in terms of Smash quality compared to the previous installments.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Oriks,02-03-2019,"The sheer amount of jank in this game is disgusting. So much relies on random chance, and the online mode, even after their fixes, is ridiculously bad. GSP is one of the worst ranking systems I've ever seen, and they still don't bother to match me with my preferred rules half the time. 3 stocks and 7 minutes, the closest I can get to competitive rules. How the hell did I get matched up with 2 stocks, 3 minutes; 3 stocks, 4 minutes with random normal stages; and 2 stocks, 3 minutes all in a row? Right after that, I was matched up with another 2 stocks, 3 minutes where we had 3 seconds of input lag. I ran a speed test and my internet was completely fine (certainly not at a quality where I should have an entire 3 seconds of input lag), which means it's either Nintendo's server screwing up or Nintendo doesn't check people's connections before letting them online.

Even ignoring online, the game seems set up to suck the fun out of things. You win when you make it so your opponent doesn't have fun. That's my experience, at least. Momentum is liable to change on a whim, when someone gets a lucky hit, just because there are so many ways to kill at far below 100% or do 20% with a ton of knockback—easily removing stage control—in a single hit. Skill seems to be far less of a factor. Since I know I'll just be called a bad player if I complain about people worse than me, I'll say this: I've beaten players who I know were far better than me just because I got a random hit in and killed them at the edge at 60%. That really shouldn't be happening so often. So many characters have tippers now, as well. It was fine when it was just Marth's gimmick, but now a ton of characters can kill ridiculously early by getting lucky with an fsmash.

There are also some really strange features that I find to make little sense. Why can't we run through people anymore? It made the neutral game a lot more interesting, and while I can understand that not everything has to be realistic, changing the ground from 2D to 1D is just strange. The world doesn't simply exist on a straight line; people can walk past each other, but now we're left with characters in Ultimate just running in place whenever someone's in front of them. Even ignoring the ridiculous anti-realism, which can be excused, it makes the gameplay itself more boring, since it makes juggling a lot easier when you take away a huge escape route for the person landing. This leaves one player just not playing the game for over 30 seconds sometimes, as they fight their way to the ground against characters who can demolish them just by running right in front of their landing and waiting, over and over and over.

Another strange feature is pitfalls, or grounding opponents. Why do people take full knockback when they're grounded now? It made sense in previous games, when knockback was halved, because it doesn't make sense that someone would be hit just as hard when they have to be knocked out of the ground as they would be without that natural reinforcement. The feature being changed like this also rewards people for spamming certain moves, such as Inkling's roller or K Rool's stomp, which are difficult to punish (yes, they can be predicted and shielded or jumped over, but even then, they can do it 10 or more times before reaching a percent where someone can actually get an equivalent punish off of them) and net ridiculously easy kills at lower percents.

Look, the game's fun sometimes, but at other times, it's just a **** show. When I start playing, I've got about a 50/50 chance between ending up satisfied or hating life, just because things don't make sense at all and both wins and losses often feel equally undeserved. I can understand those who have fun with it, but at the same time, having fun often seems to come at the expense of your opponent's fun. In previous games, I actually had fun even while losing a lot of the time. In Ultimate, losing just feels boring, since the actual gameplay matters a lot less when random kills and far-too-easy ledge traps are the norm.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Goo4you,14-12-2018,"I know, there's going to be an eye-rolling level of downvotes because people seem to react with their ""heart"" instead of their head, but...

Smash ultimate is simultaneously the best Smash ever and that isn't all that grand.

Look, most Nintendo games follow a common trend. Keep it simple, flood it with as many tedious/arbitrary side things to do, require very little time to master the basics, and slather it in as much nostalgia that it never rocks the boat. And Ultimate does that, but then I ask myself--what do you do beyond this?

I mean, what else can you bring to Smash? Fluff like new stages or music? What kind of depth can you add? And that's the thing you really can't add any more, so you're left with a cold reality; this is the last Smash we will ever see. It will get a facelift in future releases some new tracks a few new faces, but that's it. We are going to get marketed the same thing over and over and over. And that is quintessential Nintendo.

But couldn't it go in a different direction? Change the formula?

If this were any other developer, sure, but foundational products that never rock the boat are Nintendo's philosophy it seems. They would NEVER take that risk because to do so would alienate the users which err on the familiar air of nostalgia rather than see an evolution of the product to keep it alive.

So that's it, we've reached 'Peak Smash.' It's never going to be better than this, and you'll never see something different than it. So be happy?

robertcooper,23-10-2019,"i am a fan of this seiries but ultimate is a lie because this isnt ultimate
the positives: the machanics are like melee as in melee players wont care and try it and go back to melee because if it doesnt play exactly like melee then will go back to the cult of melee, the roster has every one on it, there are 6 different miltiplayer modes, can think of anymore positives on to the negitives **** you overly defensive fans
the negatives: the game has a bad ui for example why is games and more still here as in miis, and amibo should have been in vault and adventure and spirit board should have been in games and more, games and more should have been renamed single player or other modes, or co-op/solo i dont know something like that, the charackter select screen is not the order the fighters appeared in the seiries, and what counts as an echo fighter is not consistant at all, the echo fighters are noxt to the main fighters, the stages are mostly returning, the charackter selection is amazing but i have alredy used most of the roster and played on most of the stages in previous games so it fell flat for me, the game was made useing smash 4 as a base and has less single player than it.
the just bad single player content: you can fight ai in the miltiplayer modes, online is a mess because it costs money and is peer to probobly a cofee shop/ gorin contenant's wifi which means it lags randomly, prefered rules is a blaintant ****ing lie because you are suppost to get a match based on the rules you have selected but aparently that would require to many loops and strings for them to do as in literaly accounting for atleast 1,000,000,000,000 = options which is alredy abserd to do eaven with a huge team to help, then there are the online mode achievments as in i dont want to play online and the section is borderline pay walled, now lets talk about the achievments the requirements are fair, but the images use actual ****ing 3d modles only made for the achievments likw what the **** when you rescue 100 spirits you get an image of fox and kristal fighting together useing a 3d model of kristal that isnt used anywhere else not eaven the assist trophy, now lets talk about the actual single player because its borderline bad
the single player for real this time: there is classic mode where every charackter has matches built around their seiries if you count jiglypuff, wolf, and captin falcen as being from the smash bros seiries because they aclerly are not like how the **** didi this happen, next we have training aka sandbox because you can mess with almost anything you want exept the music which is dumb, mob smash aka multi man crap where you fight 100 miis because origenality is dead, fight infinate charackters ultill you die, and the mode the cia used in combination with jumper cables to torture terorist smash aka cruel smash, mob smash is borring and not fun, and hard with no rewards, they added home run contest in now with lesser scores because getting 100 is like getting 1000 in the older games, i never cared for home run contest and the fact that they had to add it in is just rediculous because it should have been there from the start, stage builder is an upgrade from the wii u stage builder but is still bad and should have been there from the start, spirit board is random **** fight that you use stickers to make the fight playablr, adventure is the same thing and its bad.
adventure mode: so when it was revealed ot looked bad and it used its opening cutscene to market the entire game how discusting of you nintendo i am sicken by what they tryed to do, the story has about as much depth as a piece of paper oh wait thats fnaf because the mad man used the minds want to complete a task to get sales for a bad game so the story of ultimate is more like a bland exuse type story as in heres the thing go stop it, the game gets borring after a few hours and it just repeats its self over and over as in the fights are so bland they suck the joy out of the mode, the bosses are crap as in spirits made them die in 10 seconds each as in they werent chalanging, the ending uses more brain minipulation by letting you play as master hand, and haveing 3 bland endings, life light the opening sont got annoying and the memes that spawned from the opening cutscene wre cringy and not funny at all
the development history: they wanted to make another smash game and game the team 3 years to use smash 4 as a base, sakuri was later horassed by people wanting wall luigi in the game, which is stupid, the people that want goku from the anima dragon ball are actually idiots because that would go against the point of the game as in video game charackters that origenated from video games are the boundarys but if you break the boundarys then you would damage the entire foundation and scructure of the game and let people request the stupidest **** to be in the game so no

However, the main way I, and almost everyone else, plays smash is online. I think you know where this is going: the online service is the most gargantuan dumpster fire of any video game i have ever played. I am not exaggerating, hyperbolizing, or overreacting. It is Sakurai’s personal slap in the face to every single person who spent their hard-earned money on it. It is, quite literally, unplayable. Genuinely **** unplayable. I can grab my **** 3DS, a copy of smash 4, and the **** school wifi and get an alright experience FOR FREE, but I HAVE TO PAY FOR A SERVICE ON CURRENT-GEN HARDWARE THAT DOESNT WORK ON ETHERNET?! It is genuinely insulting. If i hadn’t already spent 20 hours beating world of light before i even touched online play, i would have returned my copy until Nintendo fixes their service. I have been a smash fan since I was a child. I grew up on melee for years. I used to be able to competently wavedash before my disc broke. I AM A GOOD PLAYER. But because of unplayable lag, out of fifteen matches, I HAVE WON TWO. Waiting over half of a second REGULARLY to see my input and getting absolutely bodied by people who i would destroy on local just feels like Nintendo’s massive middle finger to everyone who plays their games.

Anyone saying that you should just deal with it or learn to play with the lag infuriates me, and it should infuriate you too. IT IS UNPLAYABLE. NOT MEDIOCRE, NOT BAD, UNPLAYABLE.

Anyone who is giving a positive review of this game is wrong. Until Nintendo’s online service is fixed, this review will stay at a zero. Until Nintendo’s online service is fixed, you should change your own personal reviews to zero as well.

nysailorscout,05-01-2019,"Sadly, this game is more frustrating than fun.

When you win, it often feels accidental and that is a terrible feeling. It is the opposite of earning an achievement.

When you lose, you sometimes are not even sure how you died and that is also a terrible feeling. Getting smashed out at 50% turns a fighting game into rocket tag. Whoever decided to introduce copious amounts of RNG into a FIGHTING game needs to be whipped with a wet noodle. Smash Bros is famous for being fairly unpredictable as part of its charm... but there is a difference between fairly unpredictable and lotto scratch-off!

I have played all of the Smash Bros games. I particularly remember Brawl. In that game, it was a slower pace with less aggressive stage traps, more recovery options after being smashed and less low-damage smashes. Faster is not always better. If SSB is trying to be Street Fighter, Tekken or BlazBlue... nope! That isn't the nature of this game and SSB should not try to be something that it is not.

I have Street Fighter for the PS4. If I want to play that game, I will play it and experience infinitely better balance! In Street Fighter 5, I win when I play well and when I lose, I deserved it and I know why I lost! Even MvC3 Classic is a better fighting game experience and that game is famous for using cheap tactics!

I'm also sick of the fact that it feels like half the roster are just palette swaps. I find it difficult to believe that Sakurai once said he didn't want to add any more generic sword characters because this game loves its Marth clones.

IFeelScammed,14-12-2018,"I want to start off by saying, yes this game does have nice graphics, a wealth of choice in regards to fighters, modes, stages and music. However there are some major issues I have with this game.

• Game mechanic cheesing. The AI has not really improved much; in order to beat cheese, you need to cheese even harder. No strategy or skill required, just spam and cheese better than the AI can to win.

• Some parts of Adventure mode on normal and definitely hard mode seem almost impossible due to the spammy nature of the CPUs - you need to use a much higher powered spirit to complete it without breaking your controller in anger.

• There are some hitbox or collision issues where you might miss or not properly connect with the enemy or the environment. However the CPU seems to hit your sweet spot every time.

• Critical chance.. never really liked this and it's worse than ever. A chance you'll knock someone into oblivion even if they're at low %... lost many fights due to this when I spend a good amount of time getting 150% plus damage onto a lvl 9 CPU enemy and they get a crit proc and destroy me when I'm on only at 50%.

• Online mode is very limited. They removed the option to play against CPUs with your friends online. They also removed the ability to play couch co-op with a friend online and then join/create a game to play with friends online. Same issue with Quickplay, can't couch co-op on the same Switch, every player needs their own Switch... and yeah no dedicated servers, bleh.

• Amiibos are still pretty useless. Can't play as them and can't use them for anything significant. Didn't get any rewards for leveling up my Figure Player and the only things I can do with it is have it fight CPUs in most of the options of Smash mode. There's no other modes to use it in. I would've liked to be able to use my Figure Players in a non-ranked, non-rewards, online mode to mess around with friends in. We can fight each other's FPs without having to go to someone's house and TAKE ALL MY AMIIBOS WITH ME! No seriously... they expect you to scan your Amiibo every time you want to use your Figure Player. That is absolutely ridiculous considering they expect you to use them for couch co-op. You really expect people to lug around a bag of amiibos just to play with them? Wtf?

What I would have liked, is a much better, more in depth, RPG campaign system where I can use my amiibos more effectively. Maybe even earn Figure Players digitally through that campaign. Then take everything you've gained in this campaign to an online mode to play with your friends. Not talking about ranked or a mode where you get rewards. Just an online mode to have fun with your friends and show off what you've gained in single player campaign.

An ok game and concept, a lot of work and effort went into it I'm sure. But I can only give it a 5/10 because it just really lacks the qualities that could've made it much better than it's predecessors. At this point, it's just one big mosh pit of different smash brothers games melted down into one, with some missing features and additional content.",5,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Crysus,17-12-2018,"Have a really mixed feeling to give the game only 5 Points. I really do love this game and its mechanics, local it is an absolute blast. My only issue with this game is its only mode. And since this is the mode you want to spend most your time in, i really can't give the game more points. The connection with almost each player you face is downright terrible and feels unplayable (at least to me). Especially in a fighting game, it's crucial to have on point controls without much delay. Here? Get used to half a second delay (and more if it is really bad) or don't play the online mode. Very dissapointing in my opinion",5,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

2015exe,31-03-2022,"I used to be really excited for this game after watching it's very first trailer. All it makes me do now is wish Nintendo put more time and effort into it. The visuals are nice and the soundtrack has gotten more interesting, but that's as far as the positives go for me. The characters, on the other hand, still feel WAY too old for this game. None of them have any new moves, or even moves that make more sense for them. None of them have even evolved to reference their more recent games. Ganondorf, Donkey Kong, Ness and Lucas haven't changed at all, and Peach and Luigi both went from weak to annoying. One of the biggest things that disappoints me is that they didn't make any new Mii fighters. I would have loved to see some new Mii fighters and experiment with each of them, but we got nothing new in that department. Perhaps the worst part about the game, apart from it's god-awful online mode, us the DLC. The vast majority of the DLC characters are either boring human characters, or boring human swordfighting characters. None of them stand out to me and they don't feel like they belong on the roster, especially Min Min, Sephiroth, Pyra/Mythra, and Kazuya. To be fair, they did try to balance them out, but even then they still feel way too powerful, and sometimes their weaknesses hardly matter. What I despise most, though, is the fact that Sora became the final DLC character. Unless that was to make up for not taking the chance during Smash 4, I don't know what the big deal is, and for me personally, it just made me quit the game for good. In my opinion, Sora getting into Smash is such an overly repeated demand, and confirming him long after they said ""no"" makes absolutelyno sense. I was really hoping for a character from my childhood to be the last DLC instead, but apparently fun was never an option. Overall, the game feels like it severely lacks in creativity, balance and excitement. Everything I've seen happening in the game only shows me that nothing about the game should be given any attention. The fact that it's called Smash Bros doesn't excuse a product this poor in execution, and the only reason the game is fun anymore is because it now has Sora's face on it. The last good Smash game I played may have been a few years ago, when I played Smash 4, but Ultimate isn't even worth a pit stop to me anymore, and all it made me want to do is play Smash 4 all over again.

youfreaker,25-01-2019,"Feels like an unfinished and rushed game to me. I have absolutely no idea how critics can say this is the most complete Smash game.
Classic mode has less features than SSB64. No target, no platform, no giant, no metal stage or whatever that changes the gameplay from a normal quickplay battle.

""Story mode"" has no story except for a 2 minute intro cut scene. Spirits are basically useless and the conditions are nothing that could not have been implemented in a quick play battle. A lot of themes are also weird: A zelda themed battle against ivysaur, with pokeballs as items, on a donkey kong level. While you fight Diddy Kong on a pokemon stage?

Even menu's seem to have little thought put into it. When I first started Story mode literally the whole character select screen was blocked with the ""ready to fight"" screen; before you can select a character. Meanwhile, the lower right corner of the screen had a large empty square in it.

They shouldve spent more time making the actual game itself, instead of porting an enormous useless amount of characters and stages. just the most popular 50% wouldve been more than enough content. They couldve saved some for DLC, instead of asking 25 dollars for 5 stages and 5 characters when there's already 100+ stages and 80 characters.
But I guess I shouldve seen this coming when the Nintendo Direct big end reveal was yet another character in an uselessly large roster. If that was the most exciting thing, it didn't have much to offer anyway",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
lesoori,13-12-2018,"I have loved the Super Smash Bros. series throughout the years of production, but already hate their newest release in under a week’s time. The age range chosen to be on display of the box is a lie. Nintendo is straying away from their family friendly image and is transforming into money hungry gluttons needlessly. The game itself just isn’t as fun to play anymore.
To start things off, when you purchase the game, and take it home to play with your friends and family, you will notice the ESRB (Entertainment Software Rating Board) implies 10 year olds should be able to comfortably play this game. When games are rated for everyone, it implies there is nothing obscene that parents might potentially object to exposing to their children. Everyone 10+ implies the game is still wholesome, but the game play itself might be slightly more complex for a younger child to play alone. The keyword here, slightly, is an exaggerated understatement.
Clearly, the intended audience is not for the casual gamer, but for the competitor. The damage scale is exponentially higher than previous games. If you get hit too much too fast too early, there is no room to escape anymore. In the past, if you were knocked close to being off screen, you could influence the direction you flew in order to protect yourself from dying. This game has disposed of that feature entirely. There is no longer any potential to flip a losing match into a winning match. Once you’re out, you’re out.
Even in one player modes, when you’re a little burnt out of playing competitively, you want to just sit back and play solo sometimes. The classic mode is great because even if you pick a harder difficulty, it tailors to how you play and adjusts where necessary. But collecting the new fighters can be really frustrating when you don’t know the order they appear (spoilers are easily available) and even when they show up, with 30% damage taken, one hard hit of any variety can ruin your chance of getting that one fighter you waited so long to unlock.
Realistically, when classic mode just isn’t cutting it anymore, one might switch to adventure mode as a means to unlock missing fighters. Presumptuously, I looked at the difficulty levels and picked “normal” as the mode to play casually with a few simple challenges along the way. There are a few different pathways to choose from, and when something got rather difficult, I figured I could just chose another path and come back to it. This went on until I ran out of paths because they became impossible to beat with normal, or average, skill level. An example of what I mean by “impossible” is the level where you have to dodge all of the hocotate bombs (upward bound rockets), while dodging Diddy’s upward jet pack, and Isabelle’s upward hydrant, as well as her obnoxiously long reach to pull the hocotate bombs. The whole stage is a chaotic mess of fire explosions with powerful splash damage. Even if you focus on stealing the items from them, there’s still two other fighters with movesets that allow them both to push you up and off the screen, at the same time. Another “impossible” example is the level where you fight two charizards with master balls that release both Latias and Latios, who chunk the majority of your health, even if you shield during most of the duration. You cannot shield the entirety, even if you tried, your shield will run out, resulting in you being stunned, vulnerable to punishments. I was only able to progress after lowering the difficulty to easy.
In conclusion, this game was designed for competitors to play for sponsored tournaments or to practice competitively at home. Nintendo doesn’t care about the good times you had with your friends and family playing that one match that lasted 10 minutes. Nintendo doesn’t care about the people who like to spend time enjoying something, savor the time being at the edge of their seat anticipating who might win a match, and having that long awaited for shock moment when someone turned a game around and finally won after struggling. Nintendo just wants quick matches with quick payouts. Super Smash Bros. is no longer a game for everyone. It’s a game for competitors, and fans to practice at home like Jeopardy, Family Feud, and Who Wants to be a Millionaire. If you’re looking for casual fun at home, I highly recommend playing older versions of Super Smash Bros.",2,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
1969,26-12-2018,"It's as if they designed World of Light to be
as frustrating as humanly possible.

And they succeeded.

All the stage handicaps are nothing but pure unadulterated frustration.
Is flipping controls FUN or FRUSTRATING?
Is flipping stage FUN or FRUSTRATING?
Are enemies which can't be knocked (super armor) FUN or FRUSTRATING?

And if you're new to Smash, is fighting 4 spamming characters - with abilities you don't know,
in a stage full of hazards - you have never played on FUN or FRUSTRATING?

Most of the time, you'd die and die again often not knowing who
and what and why killed you.

And if that doesn't frustrate you enough,
the icing on the cake - you will enjoy 10 second loading times
reloading the same assets again and again each time you die?

You can find spirits which remove some of the hazards, but the
gameplay remains as annoying as ever.

NyteX,10-12-2018,"I just created a metacritic account just to vent and warn as many players about this horrid piece of trash of a ""game"" that passes off as a Smash game. If you are a casual ot even semi decent player then stay far away. This game is designed for pro tournament players. The difficulty of Adventure mode, Spirit boards and Challenge battles are beyond infuriating. The AI plays like a seasoned professional even on easy. All it does is literally combo and juggle you until it just smashes you out. Shielding is useless, going behind them is useless, any tactic you have is usesless, it has an answer for anything you try to do to it. It does double or triple more damage than you because I've seen it with my own eyes, a simple kick or punch and you have 30-40% damage on 1 hit. It also can beat the crap out of you when you are glowing and supposed to be immune to attacks. It can also smash you at ridiculously low damage. I just had a fight where I was smashed out at 53% damage, no joke. Funny how I need to get them to at least 170-185 damage to even have a chance at smashing them. Also the environments ALWAYS work to the AI's advantage with floors collapsing only when you're on them or hazards only targeting you. Been playing this game since friday to try and see if there are some redeeming qualities but its been 4 days of non-stop annoyances and frustration. I'll say it bluntly, I hate this game with a passion. One of the WORST games of 2018. Nintendo packed a ton of stages and a ton of characters into what is a broken game. It will probably get traded in or better yet just thrown in the trash where it belongs just to spare some poor kid who will pick up my used copy. For those who will see this and think I'm just whining and being salty keep your opinion to yourself, I don't care. This game is pure garbage. If you enjoy getting your ass handed to you 95% of your battles then by all means buy this game, I guess you enjoy the punishment.

MasterKnightDH,31-12-2018,"You would expect that a game calling itself ""Ultimate"" would be well designed. Instead, what we get is horrendous single-player as well as a stale multi-player that requires payment to even access for online and then has painfully bad matchmaking and garbage options. The story mode has disgusting power creep, Classic Mode is all flash and no substance, and the other modes are bare bones. As for multi-player? If you can avoid getting Free For Alls, good luck with that thanks to clear problems with matchmaking, you can expect things like Meta Knight, a character who was already infamous in his own right, being able to kill you virtually inescapably and with disgusting ease off of a grab. The level of incompetence shown from this, what is supposed to be the ""definitive"" version of a 2 decade effort, would be gross for a FIRST attempt at a formula, let alone a fifth.

I'll stick with Kid Icarus Uprising's Power System, thank you very much.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
tjcavallo,17-12-2018,"Mechanically, this is the best game in the series since Melee, featuring smoother and more dynamic matches than the previous two games. It's also clear that Nintendo paid attention to feedback to the last title by making aerial combat safer and faster, bring back old mechanics like directional air dodges and dash dancing, making it easier to KO opponents at lower percents, and balancing the massive, variegated roster more than in Smash 4 or Brawl.

Despite the improvements to the core gameplay, the online multiplayer component of the game is depressingly bad. Unplayably bad. The game lacks the ability to strictly sort by ruleset, making it almost guaranteed that you will occasionally be placed in a match you do not want to play, regardless of your preference. There's also no way to see the ruleset before the match starts, and you can't quit once it has. If you self destruct or close the software you can get banned. In addition, the game will frequently match you against players with extremely poor internet connections, causing intolerable levels of lag. The matchmaking is borderline nonsense and is also character-dependent.

The only way to strictly control the ruleset is to create a battle arena, which is an arcade style lobby that forces you to wait up to 30 minutes before playing again if you lose a match. This is also the only way to play with your friends online.

The game also lacks satisfying single player content. The familiar, short Classic Mode from previous titles is back, as well as the very button mash-heavy Mob Smash mode. Aside from these insubstantial offerings, the game offers Spirits mode. While lengthy, it's effectively just a string of fights against CPUs laid out on a map. Unlocking the characters is certainly more thrilling, but it's not particularly difficult and can be done fairly quickly (approx. 10 min per character).

Back on the cheery side, the games visual and audio presentation are the best in the series, and perhaps the best on the Switch. Some of the character models are the best renditions we have seen of the characters, and all of the stages feature intricate, vibrant background art. The game features a prodigious collection of remasters of classic and modern tunes from the original franchises of the characters that comprise the game's roster. The characters look great in motion and carefully placed visual panache and audio cues help the characters feel fluid.

If you have people to regularly play the game in standard couch co-op mode with, or participate in a local scene, this is easily the best value purchase for the system yet, and it could quite possibly become your new favorite in the series. But if you planned on spending your time mostly on the online mode, I wouldn't purchase it unless Nintendo overhauls the system completely in an update, as it's actually a downgrade from Smash 4's online mode and laughably worse than the online in competitor's titles",4,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

skankevere,14-12-2018,"This game is marred by technical issues and poor design choices. control of your character is at an all time low in the smash series including brawl, this is due to the inability to do an aerial without losing momentum and an input buffering system that forces your character to use moves whose buttons you may not even be touching at the time. they set out to make a faster paced game but instead every design choice makes the game longer. almost all moves are safe on shield and some are even safe on parry. even moves that would normally be punishable like poorly spaced smash attacks can be safe on shield. this leaves the online in shambles as youre unable to play around an opponent who spams if there is even a little bit of lag. but theres always lag if you use certain controllers. in an attempt to please everyone they removed core game play mechanics and made a game feeling inconsistent and choppy. Online is poorly designed, the single player, while well designed is monotone, and extra modes leave much to be desired. these complaints would be fine if the core game play was good, however it is not.

The game mechanics feel new and polished from the series' last game, Smash for the Wii U. The story mode is very long for an adventure mode and is very fun to play as well. The new Spirits bring a fun touch to the game.
The Classic mode feels as good as always but now making the fights according to the story of the character (for example, Donkey Kong will fight King K. Rool in one of his fights).
The roster may start small with only 8 characters but getting them is so much fun, and if you lose to anew challenger, you can fight them again in a new feature Nintendo added that lets you play against the challengers you lost to.
The game is just amazing and so fun to play, but the online on the other is kinda laggy and the matchmaking isn't as good, plus now you have to pay for the Nintendo Switch Online service, something that for casual players, is awful.

I was ready to play World of Light with my friends.. but then its only 1 player? Why, why did they do this? The last Smash game that actually had a story HAD multiplayer for the story. This ruined the the game for me because otherwise this is the same as every other smash. Sure there are new ""End Game Bosses"" and thats cool, and some of the new characters are cool also, but sadly the Story mode not including 2 player has ruined my experience. Its the sad thought that including more stages and characters would be enough to satisfy us but they are wrong. Some people play for the story.

And the way ""history"" by God, is simply regrettable, it is not a grandiose room as it was in Brawl, I feel cheated with the cinematic of the Directs so that in the end the game did not have a bit of plot, so many characters and licenses together in a story for nothing, no interaction or crossover action, only a Smash Tour 2 glorified and seasoned with a boring cinematic other than.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

MatamesiQuieres,08-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is really disappointing. When it was first announced, I felt it would be one of the best 2018 games. However, when I saw it at the E3, it let me down.

The new fighters, like Daisy, Isabelle and Chrom, are nothing interesting with the exception of King K. Rool, Inkling and Ridley. No new 3rd-party characters neither, which is why there's a huge fandom of this series and, anyway, their requests are not taken in account.

My most disliked announcement was the new Assist Trophies. People felt disappointed when Waluigi was an AT once again. In my case, I really felt depressed when I saw Bomberman was one too. I mean, really? An Assist Trophy? Since the announcement of Super Bomberman R as a launch title for the Switch, both Smash and Bomberman fans determined it was time to include him as a playable fighter in the next Smash, not something else. Even notable personalities and brands agreed with it. There are a lot of reasons of why he deserves it much more than the current 3rd-party characters such as Wario Blast!, the series in every Nintendo platform, the Mario Party series developed by Hudson Soft, etc. Is this a joke? Even though both Bomberman and Hudson Soft had a long relationship with Nintendo, they just gave him mere respect.

Going on with the Assist Trophies, this feature really ruined more 3rd-party characters. Later, they announced Ashley, Isaac, Knuckles, Krystal, Shadow, Shovel Knight, Starfy and Zero as AT's as well, despite being requested by fans too. What? Why the overuse of this Assist Trophy thing? I thought Smash accepted relevant characters like those as fighters but no, looks like in a very different way.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
AnnaTheWolfLady,08-12-2018,"As much as I love this series I am unable to give this game a higher score, it was advertised as the ultimate smash bros game, sure it has more content but it's all stuff we have already seen and the small amount of real new content is... small, lacking... the game feels like a mod, a stupid plant is a playable character, we got yet another Fire Emblem character and a pokémon not many people wanted, the game been too fast is actually a downside in my opinion, why are we back to unlocking characters in a tedious fashion? and why do we only get like 8 at the start of the game? Where's home run contest? Where's target test/smash? Why is it so hard for some attacks to hit? I hate this game's hitboxes, the joycons are a terrible controller for this game, DLC got announced before the game was even out, World Of Light is super repetitive and has a weird difficulty, where's master orders btw? Why fid they make Bomberman, Krystal and Shovel Knight Assist Thropies? A lot of people wanted THEM as playable characters, including me, c'mon Nintendo, wth? Echo fighters are a joke, the combat isn't as good and lacks variety due to the game been toi fast, most melee stages are as ugly and ilegal as I remember them, they brought back pacland but left pac-maze out, there are too many Mario stages, there's like... 10? The CPUs all do the same, I was expecting to see some love for Xenoblade X but nope, Uncontrollable and Black tar are not in the game a new Xeno character would have been nice too (cough, Rex, cough, Elma)

The soundtrack is so awful in this game, it makes Nickelback's music sound like a masterpiece.

The combat is boring and repetitive. The developers put little effort to make the combat deep. When I pay $60, I expect to have a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun to me.

The AI and its difficulty were lazily designed in this game. The online multiplayer is also lazily designed with garbage matchmaking. The developers heavily advertised the ""you can play as everybody"" thing, which is nothing more than a gimmick that gets old fast. How about they spend time actually improving the gameplay, instead of coming up with gimmicks.

Hellspeller,09-12-2018,"Visually stunning, very much appreciate the huge roster of characters; this is hundred of hours of fun with friends; and this is where Smash Ultimate gets all its points.
But the so famous ""World of Light"" is a pain in the A... Its a shallow grinding experience with thousand of spirits who we dont care and simply put; breaks the game. They could have concentrated on less fights with very interesting mechanic rather then : the floor is electric ! okay then equip the spirit that gives me immunity... Then what ? its a normal boring fight. OR you will be pitted againts IMPOSSIBLE fights (and I mean it) where whatever you do, your only chance is to cheat and bug the AI and hope to be lucky. This is where Japan and their ""no playtesting"" policies hurted smash. Nobody would have liked that experience or they would have seen the frustration behind these impossible fights.

MECHANICALLY the game is almost less than great. There is still a heavy floatiness to all characters that makes it very bad for a hardcore melee player (like me). Plus, there is a lag in the input and some information do not register (this is starting to spread as a fact, look it up). So your character will most of the time: not turn around and makes short hops impossible.
Overall, this is not better than melee for me and am disapointed.
But I'll be honest, the World of Light experience is ruining me and I am writing this review still in it. I long to be done with this sh*t and have this experience way past me so I can, maybe, simply melee with friends; hoping the fun will overwrite the gameplay lags..",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
SJile,26-05-2019,"The game is still fairly new, so I understand the hype.

Visually, it's stunning. Every entry in the series is good for its time, every entry feels like a genuine graphical upgrade from the last, Ultimate being no exception.

In terms of content, the game is packed full of it. The roster is gigantic, and the value is incredible. You would be crazy to complain about these features, but as a competitor, the game has been a profound disappointment.

Mechanically, it just doesn't feel as good as its predecessors. It's certainly faster-paced than the previous couple of entries, but that's it--the high input latency and the ludicrous buffer coupled with the worst online system in modern AAA gaming all amount to a deeply unsatisfying experience. Mobility feels clunkier than at any other point in the series, which is a real issue for a game in which mobility was so crucial and interesting.

The big single player attraction, ""World of Light,"" is also a disappointment. It's perhaps the least fun single player mode in Smash history.

In a vacuum, Ultimate is a triumph of scale. It's big and bright and colorful, and people won't get tired of the ever-growing roster for a good while. But when examined closely, part for part, I just don't think it's going to be the Smash game people remember down the line.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
KyoshiLoneheart,30-12-2018,"Nowhere near as good as everyone is raving about. While this game does have a lot of positive points and good amount of content, it has so many issues that pile on quickly and ruin a lot of the fun atmosphere this game is supposed to have. First and foremost are the horrendous spirits. This incredibly stupid addition replaces the trophies of past games and it is garbage. Rather than being about collecting things and it being fun in that sense, it is all about getting spirits for bonuses and stats. That's the main reason they are there, for numbers. Without overpowered spirits you stand no chance in the harder fights in the TERRIBLE spirit board, which hosts fights ranging in difficult from brain dead easy to impossible without the right spirits. The spirit board is a disaster and usually throws any semblance of skill out the window and into a fire. The spirit really feels like a really crappy free to play mobile game concept that was built for microtransactions, it just doesn't have the microtransactions. If it did, this game would be getting a 0 from me.

The fighting is still as fun as ever, but there are obviously character balance problems and the A.I. is surprisingly inconsistent. One match they can barely put up a fight, the next it reacts to your every move and doesn't let you do anything and I have no idea why this is the case.

This game also showcases just how lackluster the joy cons are. These being the default playing method of every Switch, it is sad to see them be so unfavorable in a game as intense as this. You basically have to pick up something else if you want full enjoyment and full enjoyment will only be obtained if you avoid the spirit like the plague that it is.

Honestly, I am just disappointed. This game really can be fun at times, but the hideously inconsistent A.I. the terrible addition of spirits and this stupid meta game that nobody asked for, while the game is missing other old modes that were a better distraction than trying to get spirits all the time. Haven't en touched the online, but I have heard that it it pretty terrible, so of course, Nintendo is simply fumbling in all the usual places.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
BrushedRed,13-12-2018,"This is THE ultimate Smash Bros. game. Nintendo wasn't kidding whenever they said they were giving us everything. Over the years, they have had characters come and go, and it was upsetting to see some go (such as Snake), but this game brings everyone back... and more!

This roster goes above and beyond my expectations. With a vast variety of characters, you really can't go wrong here. I personally love Cloud and Shulk the most, but all fighting styles are represented and represented well. It also seems like some characters' movesets were updated as well, which is always nice. I think Bayonetta got a lift, as well as Cloud, and for the better!

The classic mode here is nice, and feels a lot like the older games. It's really cool that they tailored each and every character to have a different experience and theme. It's hard to explain, but when you go through the mode, you'll see what I mean. The only gripe I have is that the bonus stage is the same for everyone. I wouldn't have minded a target break stage, but if that's all I gripe about, then well this game is fantastic.

The new adventure mode, World of Light, is huge and epic. I still haven't finished it yet, but I'm 7 hours in the story mode alone and it feels like I still have a long way to go. It's very addictive though, and powering up your character is rewarding. I plan to play more with it now that I've finally unlocked all the characters in classic mode, which was definitely quite a feat. The challengers definitely show up to fight!

It's fast, it's fun, and it's competitive, improving vastly upon Smash Bros Wii U and Brawl, not that they were bad games, but they weren't quite as quick and seemless as this game is. I feel this is the TRUE successor to Melee, except more diversity and better graphics! I do hope they improve online play.

kjl3080,25-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate takes the already great series and adds amazing content into what feels like a masterpiece, and is a must buy for anyone looking for a great time.

The graphics are better than any of its predecessors, featuring detailed and beautiful character models and scenery.

The gameplay Is amazing, geared towards both beginners looking for a good time with their friends or by themselves while also towards gamers who want to play on a competitive level.

The Story mode is superb. The singleplayer campaign, World of Light, is a great experience that puts it up with Brawl's Subspace Emissary. Every spirit battle feels like a neat homage to their source games, and considering that there are thousands of spirits in the game, is a pretty incredible feat. However, as honest criticism, I believe that a crucial aspect of the game is lacking in multiplayer capability. Another thing to note that while I had no trouble completing the game on normal mode, I believe that less skilled players might have trouble with even the Easy setting. Perhaps there should be a Very Easy difficulty for those who might want to just enjoy the game.

Characters. The roster is absolutely huge, and features the return of every single fighter, with many newcomers to boot. No one could forsee fan-favorite characters join the roster like Ridley and Simon Belmont. Although I did enjoy the process of unlocking them, I think there should be a cheat code or an option to unlock all the characters at once for people who just want to pick up the game and play everyone, or in tournament play (though the latter might not be as big of an issue).

The online experience could be improved. In the midst of all the controversy, I'm going to say that Nintendo still doesn't really get the gist of Online yet, but I believe that things will work out in time, so I won't get too deep into it.

Overall, the immersive and amazing gameplay, this game is in my opinion definitely worth buying a modest $60 given the massive amount of content put in the game. Great work by Sakurai and his team, and a great experience for many gamers alike.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

This is important to the score, just as much anything else because each provide a way to play, if you do not have a group of friends to play with. Game was promised to have substantial single player and great online. Online is broken many times, has a poor netcode and frustrating matching formulas and ""scoring"" system. Check out Zero's rant on the online for more info. So, leaving us with single player...World of Light kind of sucks. Some matches early on are really cool, but the mode becomes bloated with SAME and a spirits system that sort of makes many matches pointless. I gave it a five because the gameplay is solid and has great depth, but the online and single player modes drop it down just as much.

However this installment feel exactly the same and not in the good way. On several occasions i found myself trying to attack an opponent behind me only to realize that the delay in turning my character prevented me from doing so which majority of the time cost me the fight. In turn i turned down the difficulty to normal, so far so good. I started by jumping into the spirit world right away, as i was playing i feel asleep in the first 30 min, the character i was forced to play was not engaging to me. I woke after i dropped my switch and switched from kirby to marth. After switching i attempted a level where the ground was on fire. i was on normal difficulty mind you. it took me around 40 min to clear the stage which was extremely frustrating as this is still early in the spirit world. i lowered the difficulty again after clearing it to run into stage timers and such while the only goal of me playing was to unlock a character i enjoyed.

M4thew,09-12-2018,"A must-play game for all switch owners. With more than 70 playable characters this is the smash with the largest character selection and there are even coming more with dlcs. Not only that, also the number of stages and soundtracks is bigger than ever. The speed of the gameplay is not too fast, but also not too slow. Another thing I really like is the fact, that you only have the 8 fighters from the original SMB for the N64 at the beginning.

I didn’t complete World of Light yet, but it seems like a set of fights with different challenges, so it’s sadly not that exciting, but still better than the mode we got for SSBU. I have to admit, that some of them are a bit annoying and frustrating, but nevertheless I think this is an interesting mode, even though there are only a few cut scenes and there isn’t a real story. The Classics mode is definitely better than the Wii U one, because this time every character has to do fights against aligned characters and aligned stages and music. And for some franchises they even made new boss fights.

All in all I think Super Smash Bros Ultimate was able to live up to the hype.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Rampant,13-12-2018,"The game looks good, the controls are great and there is plenty to do offline.

Now for the bad:

I bought the game for the multi-player like most users. Unfortunately, the switch has no concept of a party of friends. So users cannot queue up for a quick match with friends, and users cannot talk to friends through any means provided by Nintendo.

SSBU comes with the ability to provide online preferences for matches, but this is just a priority check. It does not actually restrict these preferences. That's similar to playing an FPS, joining a queue to play only death match but being put in a capture the flag match.

Since Nintendo is charging us money to access online play, I expect dedicated servers. There are too many cons related peer hosted matches. Additionally, if a game is unreasonably laggy, users have no way to leave the game other than closing SSBU.

There is no concept of ""elo"" in Quick matches...so expert level players will be queued against newbs.

From a product development perspective there were plenty of lower priority features that were implemented instead. E.g a really long credits scene after every ""Classic"" mode completed. Or a random appearance of a new character in the form of a challenge.

The last game I can remember to have this much first week online missteps was Rainbow Six Siege. A few weeks after the release of RSS the game was 50% off. It was near death sentence for that game, and it barely recovered. This is not much better but because it is a Nintendo flagship game it will survive.

In conclusion, the online play is sub-par for one of the OGs in gaming. I do not think this game should have been released with the current online features/issues.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

aluxisbored,10-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Definitively a must have title if you own a Nintendo Switch console. Maybe even a system seller depending on how much you enjoy the Smash series (Competitive player). The game is fast paced and exciting. It's faster than Smash 4, but not as fast as Melee, which is a perfect balance.

The game is amazing to play with other people, but that doesn't mean the single player content is lacking either.There's also a story mode titled ""World of Light"". The story isn't much of a story though. I'm yet to complete it, but it seems that it's more of a game mode that starts with a plot and ends with a plot. In between there doesn't seem to be much. Despite this, World of Light is an enjoyable and chill experience.

What I currently find exceptionally problematic about Smash Ultimate is the online. I can see what Nintendo was trying to do with the online, but it doesn't really work. When you try to match up with a preferred rule-set of 1v1 no items, you'll at times get a free for all with items. I understand that this cuts down on a waiting list, but it does seem a bit excessive at times. Not only that, but I've found the connection to be a major problem in the online. All the games I've played online had a minimum of about 100-200ms delay, which is unacceptable in a fighting game like Smash Ultimate. In our modern day, online is such a major component, and just because Nintendo ""can't do online"" doesn't excuse them from this expectation.

The single player content in addition to the online content would rate this at a 8/10 for me, but I have strong hope for Nintendo to fix the online. Though Nintendo has never really done any big changes like this, due to the online service being a charged service now, it's more credible and realistic for the public to have outcry on the subject matter. Many online sources (Twitter, Reddit) have many complaints towards Smash Ultimate's online, and I believe Nintendo will take this criticism and improve upon it. Therefor I will give it a 9/10",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Blackmailed,24-12-2018,"Well then, after the long wait since the reveal trailer for Smash Ultimate, it's finally out. I can say, confidently, that this did not disappoint and packed a punch that'll leave me in awe for quite a while. Masahiro Sakurai's work on this game really shows, yet people are still calling it a port with no competitive mechanics. I'd like to ask you, the reader to please look back at Sm4sh and tell me, is it really a port of Sm4sh? If you say yes then please reevaluate, it's like saying Melee is a port of 64 just because it's concept is similar or Brawl is a port of Melee because it's got some of the same characters. As for the competitive mechanics, it's the best INTENTIONALLY competitive Smash Bros. out there because of the amazing competitive mechanics. Directional Air-Dodging helps mix-up recoveries, combo strings, or landing, not to mention the fact you can no longer spam roll or air-dodging, as you could in Sm4sh, to purposefully stall out the match and play defensive. You may be wondering, ""why did you say best intentionally competitive Smash game? Melee is much more competitive."" You are correct on that my read but did you know Sakurai never intended Melee to be competitive in the slightest? Wave-Dashing was a glitch that players found out early in Melee's meta, Sakurai himself he didn't like Melee's competitive scene which is why we got Brawl. I've been ranting on a bit too much, it's just stupid reviews tend to make me quite ""triggered;"" especially when it's about someone's literal livelihood.

Back to Smash Ultimate -- I personally think it's a great way to, potentially, send off Smash Bros. The whole entire ""Everyone is Here!"" aspect is really amazing, as it wraps Smash up in nice wrapping paper making it so people who previously lost their mains to be able to actually play them and it feels really smooth, alongside being clean overall. Have I talked about the graphics? Whoever designed the special effects, bravo to you. I hope Sakurai gave you a huge raise because my god, is this game absolutely stunning. Don't even get me started on the music in this game, the remixes, the childhood songs, everything. It's beautiful whether you look at it in the visual sense or the musical sense.
There are major pros to this game but minor cons as well, I want to rate this a 9 because of the cons that are absolutely shoved into your face but I just cannot. This game is amazing, it's really an Everybody game. Whether you enjoy casual or competitive, you can find fun in this game.

Let's talk about the pros for a second.
-Directional Air-Dodging is back and it's more polished than ever, with end-lag tacked onto it so you cannot excessive use it for Wave-Dashing or recovering.
-World of Light, it's an absolutely amazing adventure mode though the CPUs can be a bit hard for someone who isn't too skilled in competitive and especially who's into casual. Tone down the difficulty a bit and then this would be a 9/10 adventure mode.
-Reduced Landing Lag makes a lot of options safe on shield making characters who previously suffered from mediocre or terrible frame-data more viable in the meta.
-Everyone is Viable; looking at Smash Ultimate, you can see that everyone is very viable. Characters who are considered the worst, like Bowser Jr., are still insanely viable. Though I do not like the balancing choice of making ""Everyone Overpowered""
-Casual Gameplay is personally not my style, but as someone who does play friends with items on it's extremely fun. It's fast-paced and a lot of items are just overall fun to dink around with.
-UI choices in this game are absolutely stunning, the clear inspiration from Persona seeping into the personality of Smash Ultimate.

Now for some cons.
-Online is an absolute mess. I cannot sugarcoat how bad the online services are, and this time we have to pay for them. There are no dedicated servers for Ultimate meaning you'll most likely find someone who doesn't have a Wired LAN cable and the match will be a slideshow. As I mentioned before I do not like the whole ""Everyone should be Overpowered"" design philosophy for fighting games because most of the time it'll end up with people abusing that power, it's very clearly shown on Online with K. Rools abusing super-armor on unfortunate people to match with them.
-Everyone is Overpowered, don't get me wrong, making people viable is fine... But if you make everyone overpowered that's not fine. Changing frame-data to make it so someone is quicker and has more punch to their moves is absolutely fine, making a lot of moves safe on shield, kill, and spike, is not the greatest.
-Nerfed Grabs is a nitpick, but I find it annoying when I try to dash-grab and end up not dashing in the slightest and whiffing my grab, causing me to get punished. It takes a little while to dash out of shield and grab, overall grab has less range.

Sakurai, it's not perfect but continue to work on masterpieces, I cannot wait to see what the future holds.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Demilith,26-12-2018,"Super Smash Ultimate es un juego que debes tener en el switch, ya sea para jugar individualmente el modo historia, como para jugar con amigos, es un compilatorio de toda la saga, la cual cuenta con un pequeño ajuste y refinacion con respecto a entregas anteriores, no es tan rapido como el melee, no es tan lento como brawl, se puede haber esperado mas del modo de historia, pero el juego es un equilibrio casi perfecto dentro de esta saga.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
newazurill,26-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is an upgrade in almost every aspect to its predecessor on the WII U.

The three main aspects to a successful smash game are: an exciting multiplayer experience, an enjoyable single player mode, and a good competitive environment.

For the multiplayer, this game has it all. It has more fighters, stages, items, rules, and modes than ever. Smashdown and Squad Strike are a good change of pace from normal smash play and tournament mode finally makes a return. If you want to play for fun with friends this game is by far the best in the series.

While the single player is pretty fun and keeps you engaged even when you don't have anyone to play with. Classic mode returns to its roots and we finally get a new adventure mode. The adventure mode features a bunch of fun and creative challenges that could sometimes get a bit too difficult. An issue with the adventure though is that it gets a bit repetitive and lacks the cutscenes and the character interaction that we used to love from the subspace emissary from SSB Brawl.

In terms of competitiveness though this game is a huge upgrade to the WII U version. The game feel, controls, and mechanics have been refined greatly making for a much more competitive experience. The main problem to that though is the online. You now have to pay for Nintendo online and it lags form time to time. Also the removal of For Glory forces you to keep playing different rules multiple times. Arenas are a decent addition though.

Some people are disappoint though at the exclusion of some somewhat popular characters and I think that every fighter that got in deserves it more than the ones that got excluded. Waluigi is a side character that only appears as a playable character in party and sports games while Daisy was in a primary game. Geno is a side character from a spinoff over 20 years ago, there are many other Mario character that should be prioritized ahead of him. And Isaac is from an old game that isn't too popular. Overall, the character choices in SSBU are pretty good.

In conclusion, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a stellar game and is a must-buy from Switch owners as it combines the fun of chaotic party games with the rich complexity of a fighting game.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

DoggoLord,30-12-2018,"This game is FANTASTIC! I love that you have to work to unlock all of the characters instead of having them all immediately given to you. It can feel a bit tedious at times, but i still enjoy it a lot. The world of light adventure mode is very fun and is a great way to get used to the controls of the game, instead of jumping into online right away and getting whooped.
Speaking of the online, it’s the one thing i can really fault this game for. The connection issues are pretty bad at times. I’m not sure if My internet is bad or there’s something Else in there. But that Only slightly hinders My experience with this game, so i won’t even take away a point for it. The game is amazing in every other way. The graphics are stunning, the amount of characters assures everyone can find at least one character that suits their playstyle, the enormous amount of stages keeps the game feeling fresh and New each match, and there’s just so much more.
Now, coming back to the world of light mode. The entire spirits mechanic is lots of fun and is very interesting. I love seeing the world around me expand once i’ve cleared An area of the map. I highly enjoy finding powerful spirits and coming back to some of the more challenging battles you couldn’t beat before. It leaves you with a good feeling afterwards.

ManyAchievables,30-12-2018,"I LOVED Smash 4, it wasn't my favourite game of all time, but it wasn't worthless to me. And then, during the teaser trailer, my heart melted with joy, of a new Smash Brothers game. Then it was announced that every fighter that was in the series would be in Ultimate. This made my excitement grow even more for my most anticipated game of 2018. Then the newcomers came, and that's when I think my heart should've exploded if I was normal. Ridley, K Rool, Incineroar, Chrom (Eh, not much of a fan of Fire Emblem), and all the other newcomers. They all fit in beautifully with the veterans like Mario, Link, Donkey Kong, Samus. Not much I can say that hasn't been said before by dozens of people. Great game play, amazing graphics, almost overwhelming character amount (but not too overwhelming). Simply put, it's Ultimate.

MangaRinku,30-12-2018,"This is one of the best games for the Nintendo Switch period. This game brings tons of new changes that make the experience of playing this game fresh for season veterans and newcomers to this franchise. People think that unlocking characters is tedious, but the reference to the original Nintendo 64 Smash game where you start with 8 characters is genius, and even if you lose, the game has an option to let you re-challenge characters you lost against, which means if you found a character you like and want to get more characters you lost against, you can do that. The challenges that give you in game rewards is a nice spectacle that lets you try new things and notice all the little details in this game (My favorite example is Ness and Snake playing baseball... but with a grenade) The revamped Classic mode is way better than smash 4's, and gives references to all characters' past games or themes that they have. World of Light (the game's story mode,) is another mode catered to little references where you collect spirits that power your character that you can also use in battles against others.

Smash Ultimate is a game catered to both people who play for fun and play the game seriously, and Sakurai's team has put so much effort into making this a game that everyone can enjoy, even if people have to complain that it's not catered to them. The online IS kinda bad, but they're improving it. The difficulty levels people are whining about, stop being babies and find a solution to it, Pro Japanese smash players designed it so of course it's gonna be good if you put the WoL difficulty on hard or Level 9 CPUS.

Also speaking of everyone is here... can we get Jibanyan for dlc?",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
KrimsonKatt,01-01-2019,"This game is perfect in almost every way. The world of light story mode is fun and addicting, the new characters are awesome, the gameplay is fast and fluid, Bayonetta is nerfed to the ground, (finally) they brought back all the scrapped characters from Melee and Brawl, Classic Mode is the best in the series, and it has over 800 music tracks. There are only a couple problems. The first one is the lack of trophies, They were my favorite part of the older games, collecting them and viewing their descriptions. Spirits don't stack up to the trophies of old mainly due to the lack of descriptions. I never really viewed the trophies from multiple angles, so Spirits being just pictures doesn't bother me. I hope they add descriptions to the spirits in a future update. Another problem is the flawed online. Smash Ultimate online lags just as much as Smash 4's, which is insulting due to you needing to pay for online this time. Nintendo seriously needs to make dedicated servers for their most successful games and adding support for emulating non-NES games if they want more people joining their online service. Free low-budget games bi-monthly like PS+ would be nice too. The biggest problem with the online however is the awful matchmaking. Unlike Smash 4, where the rule sets were chosen for you and put into the categories For Fun (casual) and For Glory, (competitive) Smash Ultimate only lets you choose ""preferred rule-sets."" However, even if you make your preferred rules no items final destination 3 stock, you can still be put into a match with all items FS meter random stage 10:00 time instead. I really hope Nintendo fixes there online soon and makes ultimate's online modes similar to how they worked in ARMS, another fighting game.

Now don't get me wrong this is a great game! Its mechanics amount of spirits and amount of fighters are massive and not to mention the great soundtracks. However, I gave this game an 8 and not a 10 because the story mode is repetitive and spirits are only fun to get if you know the game they are from. The game, in general, is lacking an objective to achieve which overall makes me lose interest in it.

SeAzOriginal,13-06-2019,"Never have my opinions changed soo much about a game. I bought this day one and in fact bought my switch for this game mainly. It was an absolute blast when I first played it. Learning all new characters and getting used to the new style. But unlink every other person I play against, I have other games to play. It had been about 1month since I last played and I thought I’d pick it up again. I was a bit rusty so I chose to play the ai at a level 8. I was winning easily and went online but soon found that the only people still playing were people who dedicated themselves to mastering one character, and repeating their attacks. This made the game flat out unplayable online. On long with this was the buggy grab action where my hand would randomly go straight through the enemy, along with infinite blocking. Unless your willing to play this game as your only game, I would not recommend buying it at this stage of the game.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Chaserbrown,06-08-2019,"This review is from the perspective of someone who's played hundreds of hours of local multiplayer and a bit of online. Note that I'm a more casual player who's ""pretty good"" in terms of casual play, but not great in anything more than that. Also, I've barely played any other fighting games apart from Smash.

Smash Ultimate is a genuinely great local multiplayer game. The characters are diverse and interesting, and there are lots of options for casual play. The amount of items, stages, and characters is absolutely incredible, and leads to an experience with a lot of variety. For the core multiplayer experience, there is a lot there for you, and it's always fun when you're in the right setting.

Really what helps this game is that Smash often acts as a ""universal language"" among people, whether or not they play games often. As a local multiplayer option, it's the best I've found. Everyone knows how to play at some level, and this is further benefited by the fact that the Switch has detachable controllers. This can be useful for 1v1 battles, although it should be considered that usually you will learn to beat other casual players if you play the game enough. After hundreds of hours of playing, I consider myself to be a ""great casual player"", which doesn't mean that I'm good at the game, but I'm far better than other friends that don't own a Switch. If you have a friend who's around the same skill level as you, that constant competition won't wear out very quickly. With other people at various skill levels, doing a free-for-all leaves open the possibility for anyone to win, especially with team battles, items, etc.

As a singleplayer game, though, Ultimate is mediocre. World of Light is alright, and classic mode is fine too, but you won't get much play out of the game with just singleplayer. As for online, it adds much more to the experience, but it still is nothing when compared to the standard local multiplayer. It's easy to get tired of online, but you can play for hours locally without any problem. Without the local multiplayer, this is likely a 6/10 or 7/10 game.

The game does feel great! The physics are perfect, in my opinion, and going back to Smash 4 is honestly painful in comparison. As I said before, the characters are diverse and have a lot of satisfying attacks, further heightened by HD rumble. In my opinion, it's by far the most fun Smash game to date.

In conclusion, Smash Bros. Ultimate is a must-have game if you're going to be in a lot of situations for local multiplayer. If people are coming to your house, or you bring your Switch to school or work, this is the perfect game. The short rounds make fitting the game into small periods of time easy, and the universality of Smash as a series makes it perfect for any occasion. As a singleplayer game, it's not great, but for multiplayer you can't do much better.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Bobinator,27-09-2020,"The amount of content is overwhelming. With many more updates and dlc, there is no way to get tired of Nintendo's most refined smash game yet. There have never been so much music, fighters, and stages. There is also a lot of single player content with world of light, classic mode, and other mini games. Despite all this online is fairly weak. Each mode is limited and annoying. Also matches have many technical issues. Frame rate drops, input lag, and connection errors make online a mixed bag.

The story mode is a bit lackluster compared to brawl's subspace emissary, yet is still fun. One major issue with this game is online, as it is terrible.

MatthewAce70,30-09-2020,"I am here to declare that Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the ULTIMATE Smash! There you go, done. Case closed, have a good night…

Alright, in all seriousness now, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a really good fighting game. It is also officially the best entry in the series (IMO), but most importantly it is a celebration of the series itself, and of Nintendo, and of video games as a whole to some extent.

First of all, let’s begin with the main 'Smash' mode, described as ""a great place to get started."" Definitely true. You start off with the original N64 cast of fighters and the more you play this mode, the faster new challengers will approach gradually. There are several more ways to unlock all the fighters of course, but simply playing Smash battles many times may be the fastest way to reach that goal. There are 3 styles of battles: Time, Stock, and Stamina. All stages now have a Battlefield and Omega (Ω) form. There is also a feature that allows you to choose your music track right before you begin fighting. Special Smash comes with 1 new mode, Smashdown. Essentially, you fight through the entire roster until evey fighter has been played with at least once; It’s really great. And there's also a new mode called Squad Strike, which plays just like normal Smash, but with a twist; there are special formats to choose from: Tag Team, Elimination, and Best of.

Secondly, the Games & More mode. Classic Mode returns and it’s better than ever. Now each fighter has their own assigned routes with thematic titles. For example, Mario’s route is called ""Let’s-a Go!"" His route is kinda based on his journey in ""Super Mario Odyssey"" where he travels around the world across various kingdoms, and ultimately has to fight Bowser (and Giga Bowser). I have a few personal favourite routes including Mario’s: Zelda – Wisdom Prevails; Sonic – At the Speed of Sound; Rosalina – One Star after Another; and Simon – Smash-vania. On the one ""Master"" hand, we have a fresh new take on this mode, and a really good one at that. On the other ""Crazy"" hand, we get an inferior bonus game, no Target Smash, and no more ending videos for each fighter after the credits roll. But still, Classic Mode looks and feels more engaging this time around with the fighters all having different paths to follow and bosses to conquer. And FYI, you’ll be fighting against Master Hand and/or Crazy Hand with most fighters. Mutli-Man (or Mob) Smash returns, as well as the Mii Fighter creation and amiibo feature from Smash 4.

Thirdly, the Vault mode, which contains various features and functions. You'll find menus for Sounds, Replays, Challenges, and much more.

Fourthly, the 'Online' mode, which I can’t and won’t talk about, because I don’t have an Nintendo online membership (sorry about that).

And last but not least, the Spirits mode. As the biggest brand new feature in this game, the spirits in this game serve as a replacement to both the collectible trophies, which were a staple since Melee (sadly gone), and the stat-mod stickers from Brawl. Spirits have a stronger RPG element here than the stickers way back in Brawl’s Subspace Emissary. Inside this mode lies Spirit Board, the Collection room, and the all-new Adventure mode: World of Light. The whole adventure is great! But honestly, it could’ve been so much better in several ways than what is on offer. For instance, no platforming levels (except for 1), no beat 'em up moments, and hardly any cutscenes amongst a few other stuff. In reality, World of Light is a game of spirit battles spread all over 3 giant realms (or maps). The spirits must be saved by defeating their puppet fighter hosts. The 1st realm is ruled by Galeem, the 2nd one is ruled by Dharkon, and in the 3rd one you must vanquish them both together for the true ending. And before the true final battle you'll have to play as Master Hand himself and man that is awesome! I have enjoyed playing through this adventure. The whole journey feels like a rollercoaster of fan service, in a good way. Going through different video game worlds, discovering so many references, and saving all spirits and the corrupted fighters. Sadly there isn’t any storyline to get invested into, it’s all about liberating the spirits and taking down the overlords. It may not be the most satisfying story for everyone, but for Nintendo players and fans it's a wonderful joyride.

With over 70 fighters, over 100 stages, and over 800 music tracks, Smash Ultimate is packed to the brim with content and the developers are still working to deliver more updates in the future. It is by no means a perfect game, but it’s still a solid game in its own right. The gameplay is fast and fluid, the menus feel good to navigate through, and the overall presentation of the game is glorious. My final verdict: Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a fun game. Aw Yeah!

Thank you Masahiro Sakurai and team, and Nintendo. Smash Forever!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Ultimate est un monstre, le gameplay des combats est excellent, le nombres de personnages c'est indécent et l'équipe nous surprend toujours avec les nouveaux venus. Les modes classiques de Smash qui sont présent sont réussi et sympa à jouer. Le mode entrainement et un ajout cool, le mode classique est bourré de références selon les personnages qu'on joue, c'est un second jeu de trouvé ses références.
Les esprits ont intéressants et apporte quelques choses leurs des sessions entre amis, surtout quand des personnes ont peut jouer à Smash. Le tableau est un excellent moyen de jouer régulièrement avec des défis à plusieurs niveaux de difficultés. Le mode aventure est certes moins impressionnant que celui de Brawl, mais les décors, le petit scénario, les combats et parfois les références sont très bien réalisées et surtout que c'est un mode qui n'est pas un petit ajout pour un joueurs normal.

Nudie,30-08-2020,"There are not many games that come close to the entertainment games like Super Smash Bro’s. offers. Hours and hours of playing super smash with 6-7 of my friends have given me a good amount of judgement on the video game and I got to say it’s a good one. This game has it all, a huge roster of characters from your favourite games, a story mode (that could be a lot better), non linear ability to play each of these characters and even stage building aspects. This game is something you can literally pick up at anytime and just get into it, simple to play, hard to master.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Cezico,21-12-2020,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the definitive Smash Bros. experience, with all characters and nearly all stages making an appearance. It brings back Melee's quick-paced gameplay making it great for hardcore players, its single-player campaign, while a bit tedious at times, is a great addition. Its online is held back mostly due to NSO's poor quality, but even without a LAN adapter, it's more than manageable. It had some missed potential that especially shows itself while playing solo, but it does everything you would expect from a Smash Bros. game: a fun, quick, competitive game you could bring to a party.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Filmanwalt,08-10-2020,"Super Smash Brothers - Story mode (Date of the Review 20.12.18)

After 23 hours 52 min. 23 sec. I finished the story mode World of Light 100% on the difficulty level normal. I really have to say the scope blew me away, there were just an incredible number of fights. I also have to throw my concerns about the Spirit mechanics overboard because I really enjoyed the whole system. Whether it is to collect individual cards to upgrade or to use them correctly, strong thing.

The map layout and the many great references to other games were terrific for nostalgic moments and also brought a lot of variety, be it puzzles or getting ahead with means of transport. The music always does the rest, great!

I hardly have any criticisms of the adventure mode, only more cutscenes could have been there and I missed a teleport function at the beginning in the individual dungeons.

-------------------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------

If I'm going to rate the rest of the game, I have to say that I really enjoy Smash Brothers Ultimate .... OFFLINE. Unfortunately, the game has been severely cut in online mode. Modes such as Squad Smash, which I think is awesome, is completely missing online. In addition, there are always problems with laggs or initially problems with your own chosen preferences when searching for players (which has now been largely fixed, almost only comes in my chosen 1vs1 without items or ultimates). But if everything works it is of course wonderful and is also a lot of fun online. I just hope that the missing offline modes will simply be integrated into online mode. With regard to the cumbersome menu navigation (e.g. no messages, no clever Party Invite System, etc.) one cannot criticize Smash, since it already starts here at Nintendo, whose online system, as has been criticized enough, is simply not up to date.

The roster is of course top notch and I don't really miss any character, which makes me look forward to the DLC because I can only be surprised. There are still some modes, characters that I haven't played yet, you just get a lot of content here. Classic mode, All Star Smash or the ghost mode, in which you play against selected ghost cards in order to unlock them, are all a lot of fun.

Conclusion

Overall, Smash is a great overall package and a wonderful game, a must-buy for Switch owners. A few more fixes in the connectivity and expansion of the online content and I'm completely satisfied, 9/10 helper trophies by then.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

More than 70 playable characters, a lot of scenaries, a complete and variate classic and modern games soundtracks list... IS PERFECT! Story mode is long and full of surprises.

MrSirPerson,23-04-2020,"This game has been painstakingly crafted to appeal to the best of both worlds in terms of the casual and competitive scene. Each character brings it's own unique flavor to battles, with strengths and weaknesses. This has the best roster balance out of any Smash game, making every character feel viable in their own sense. The speed of fights are just right, feeling like anyone can pick it up, yet still allowing the competitive scene to go absolutely nuts with it. Spirits are a cool concept that you can have some fun with, yet feel like they can easily be sidelined. World of Light and the Online mode have some legitimate problems. World of Light is a cool collection of specialized fights around certain characters, but is very repetitive and doesn't have very much payoff in the end. NIntendo doesn't understand what makes good online. The entire experience feels like everything is delayed, making it slower than normal, not to mention the freeze-ups if one of the players has sub-par internet. However, to me, a 10/10 doesn't mean a perfect game, though it will be amazing. A game can receive a 10/10 from me depending on what it represents. The lineage of this series, combined with what this game coming out means to me, combined with the amazing memories it has given me, means it clearly deserves a perfect score, even with a few problems that barely detract from the core experience.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

You start out with the original 8 characters from super smash bros on the n64, and if you play a lot of classic mode, then you’ll unlock all the characters pretty quickly. I set out to clear classic mode with every character, and I found that whenever you beat classic mode for the first time with a character, you unlock a new one. Speaking of new characters, HOLY MOLY they put in almost every highly requested character. Ridley, king k rool, banjo kazooie, Minecraft Steve. And with the mii costumes, we got sans and cuphead.

rivalfive,29-11-2020,"Sure, it's not Melee, but Melee's not Ultimate.

This is the best Super Smash Bros. game. This is a subjective opinion, but after its release, many competitive fighting game fans turned to it from Melee. Not only is it packed with content, but it has an entertaining and balanced fighting system with patches and changes implemented every few weeks. As well as this, it is with ease in my opinion the best couch multiplayer game you could play, at least on current-gen consoles. There are so many modes, Adventure and Spirit Board are new additions, while favorites like Classic Mode and Special Smash return with more options than ever. The AI is considerably better for us loners, while in Smash 4 the highest difficulty was the same fighting experience as fighting a dead person, in this installment there can be at least some challenge found at the higher settings. So 1, it's the best Smash and 2, it's portable! In HD? It's not on the 3DS and it has the fastest action since Melee? How did I give it a 9 and not a 10?! Well my friend, you have three wishes. Nintendo. Granted. Switch. Granted. Online? Granted. Nintendo Switch Online is a problem. It is priced well, it is incredibly affordable at a mere £18 a year, it comes with free NES and SNES games, but the online multiplayer service, oh it ain't too hot. Lag. This has lag. Making the game unplayable at times, when players are from different countries. Well, that's it. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is so fun and could be the best fighting game of all time and I've given it 9/10.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Gontrand00,07-12-2020,"It's kinda sad that people can be blind and stupid enough to give this game a 10, because if it wasn't called ''Super Smash Bros'' this would received a merely 7 overall by most people. So fanboys can be fanboys anyway.

I grew up with Smash 64, then Melee and Brawl (skipped the one on Wii U).

There was always a possibility to have fun and compete with several lvl 9 CPU without looking it unfair. But in Ultimate, it's exactly the opposite.

Although I had fun in the Classic mode, the Adventure mode is pure trash (not talking about comparing with Subspace or anything). Outside the fact that there is no story, no cinematic or stuff like in Brawl, there is also no fun to just have constant battle against random CPU to save Spirits that most of the time won't give you any bonuses (so why the **** would you save them ?). And the **** loading screens all the time, even if they are 3 seconds ! Surely they could have found a way to make it faster because it just makes everything feels slow.

I think also it's such a cheap way to add ''challenge'' in fights in Adventure mode to put stuff like ''floor is lava'', ''bombs everywhere that kills you because the 3 others CPUs are constantly throwing them at you'' or ''Sonic giving you 25HP hits in stamina mode where you deal only 4HP damages with smash attacks''. Like, what the **** happened with the devs ? Where in their mind did they actually thought this could be a fun challenge ? It is not. It's lame because it's not like we had an AI system that was not working in the previous game, so why changing it to make it frustratingly hard ?

I played for 2h of the World of Garbage Light and decided to quit because I had enough. It is purely sad since I played hundreds of hours with the previous games, and here I think I'll just go with the classic and solo fights. I could do the Adventure mode in Melee 25 times without being bored, doing the Subspace many times either, but **** World of Light, seriously. But I am happy for you if you have fun with it, since I don't.

The controls and hitboxes are honestly not that good, and someone in the reviews (IFeelScammed) pointed something really important : you seem to miss your opponent a lot when you fight, whereas they seem to always hit you perfectly, even on LVL5. That's what I call unfair challenge. I don't see the point of playing a fighting game where the only thing you have to do is purely to ''smash'' your controller until you beat your opponent. Even if it's an arcade-like game, it doesn't mean it has to be clunky and superficial. You also don't have a lot of flow-opportunity when you fight, since some fighters are clearly slow and not fluid in their attacks/combos possibilities.

I am also not really found of playing with items and Ultimate seems to constantly play on that (World of Light).

So this game can be quite fun for sure, but the adventure mode is a lazy way to add content to the game, I don't give a **** about spirits and assist stuff, they are there to just balance the fact that the challenges are unfair. That's cheap.

I didn't talk about the online mode because I haven't (and won't) try it because I know Nintendo don't care about making a good online mode for any of their games (except, strangely, MK Wii lol).

So there you go, **** the critics that gives Nintendo games 9-10/10 because they don't deserve it, they are lazy. What's the point of making a fighting game if you don't have fun fighting ?",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
LeilaMediaLab,01-12-2020,"Super Smash Bros is a fun game to play with your friends and it's fun to play with other characters from different games. The only thing I want is that Super Smash Bros add more characters. I give this game 10 out of 10 :). The reason why we like to play the game is that we like to smash each other in-game. Smashing each other in the game just makes the game a lot of fun. We can also talk to each other like say I’m in a team so my team vs some other team right. We can communicate with each other so we can know where the other players are on the map. The game really gives out the happiness in us, it’s just a game where we can chill and have a whole lot of fun!! Like I said before the gameplay is just mostly fighting, shooting, and defense. There is also a story mode for smash bros that you can play, the story mode is a fun one to play as well. With smash bros, there’s other games that is connected to it like super mario, brawl hala, minecraft (maybe), Pac Man (maybe), sonic (maybe), Splattoon (maybe).

MartinAZ,11-04-2022,"Martin A. - A once in a life time collaboration of gaming.

Who would have thought that putting 43 games into 1 would make one hell of a fighting game. With over 89 characters, including brand names, such as Mario, Sonic, Pikachu and Sora; an additional 103 unique stages in 3 different forms (over 309), Masahiro Sakurai has made sure that not 1 match will ever play the same. Did I mention that 8 players can join in this chaos?

What I hated. Where's my Crash Bandicoot? Not everyone made it but that doesn't discredit the sheer amount of hard work that it took for such a game to exist. There are many things to do but they all devolve to the basics and at it's heart, this is still a fighting game. Every mini game is defeat 20 Yoshi's or whack a giant Pikachu. There's a story here but it falls back to its base, meaning, it's just a 100 match campaign with a boss or two at the end.

What I loved. Playing with friends, like all it's previous titles. There's just nothing else similar to this scale. This falls under must own.

Super Smash Ultimate is truly a gaming world wonder. 9 out of 10.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
PrincessRescuer,18-02-2021,"Is the Switch installment of Smash really the Ultimate one? Not really. First off, unless you have other people to play with, this game is worthless. The multiplayer is amazing, with more stages to pick from than any previous game, as well as the ability to have up to 8 players and select Battlefield and Flat variants of every stage.

First off, the single player is bad. The multiplayer is where you're going to get your money's worth, up until the next one comes out (which it will, Nintendo isn't going to end a popular franchise, no matter what subtitle it has). World of Light lacks platforming stages and is a bunch of gimmick fights. Classic mode keeps changing the difficulty instead of staying on the same one like the other games do. And I forget the other things because they're not as important.

One huge positive is the variety of options, including plenty of languages to change into. Compared to the other games, you'll at least get something out of those.

The problems begin when you replay matches and stages- you need to select characters and colors again every single time. You need to select the song (from a long list) every single time unless you want it randomized. You need to come up with rulesets and save them and remember which ones are which, and it's a hassle. The game is notoriously full of input lag. And there are so many characters, it might take a while to choose or even just find which character you want.

Then there's the online mode. The online mode is terrible and certainly no For Glory from Smash 4. First off, it's 1-on-1 only, meaning you have to wait in a lobby instead of matches being instant. They got this right in the previous one, and now they change it to something much worse? And if you play in handheld mode and your Switch falls asleep, not waking it up will kick you out of the lobby and back to the start. You wait and wait, all to lose to someone who plays the game constantly and destroys you in an instant. The online input lag doesn't help either. It's so severe, it even changes the tier lists and allows slower, but more powerful characters to be better than they should. And I should stress, the Wii U's online was free! And the experience was better!

And the character choices, don't get me started. There are too many third party characters, some from games exclusive or mainly played on consoles other than Nintendo. This is diluting the identity of Smash and making me less excited for new character announcements. And despite the endless discussions of which new character should be included on forums, this is how the hierarchy works: Creators > Investors > Japanese Fans > Everyone else. Chances are, the choices of you and your colleagues aren't making it in unless they're desperate to sell a new installment or a new season pass. Especially given how expensive new characters are, they aren't worth buying DLC for. You might get your choice once in a while, and usually when a new installment comes out.

Overall, not a bad game on its own, but one that has soured me on the series.",5,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Smash Bros Ultimate es la entrega definitiva de la saga. Posee el plantel más amplio de personajes y de escenarios, el cual está constantemente actualizado por Nintendo.

La cantidad de modos de juegos es notable, pero el que más destaca es combate local y el competivo online.

Es la mejor opción para sacarle jugo a las capacidades online de la consola, tiene una gran comunidad alrededor del mundo.

Historia: Modo de historia totalmente novedoso, encarnamos a kirby el cual tiene la misión de rescatar a todos los personajes de Nintendo en su versión oscura. No es el punto fuerte del juego, pero es un añadido bastante interesante para el juego offline.

Gráficos: los gráficos son sobresalientes, los personajes y los escenarios están muy bien pulidos. Los escenarios poseen un dinamismo excepcional, variando el fondo a lo largo de la batalla con guiños icónicos de cada una de las sagas.

Bando Sonora: de lo mejor que hay en el mercado, posee los mejores temas de cada una de las sagas, añadiendo epicidad a las batallas.

Dificultad: la inteligencia artificial no presenta un gran reto para el jugador experimentado, pero si es un buen reto para los nuevos jugadores.

Zquaranteneuf,24-05-2021,"This game is fine for offline play. HOWEVER.. the online experience is excruciating.

Since the game is designed with very specific moves that are effective to continually spam, most players are not interested in playing against you; they are interested in abusing you. Because in Ultimate, you don't have to be able to play well to reach a high level, you just need to know how to spam and tire people. Because of that, most players you encounter that use the same character will play in almost the exact same way. They abuse the game's main inherent flaw, then rinse and repeat. Again and again. Some characters are better balanced, of course, but at least HALF of the roster is DESIGNED to have a gameplay equivalent to: run away and spam. I can't fathom this decision, which results in very boring, predictable, and infuriating gameplay.

Also, some characters have a move-set so prioritary over all the other characters that it's virtually impossible to gain the upper hand in what would usually be a close match-up.

I cannot insist enough: the game is designed to favor spamming and ""camping"", two of the most obnoxious things people abuse in online gaming (aside from teabagging, which also occurs all the time... people are just that arrogant..).

Then, prepare to play in majority against DLC characters. Is it because they're cool? No, it's because of the pay to win element. DLC characters are faster and stronger than the base roster, and make it even more easier to cheese your opponents to victory. There's no question about it.

Also to note, if you don't want to rematch someone, don't worry, the game will most likely rematch you against them anyway. It just doesn't care. Then you have to endure another session with them (you can't disconnect or SD on purpose, otherwise the game locks you out of the online mode).

Finally, some of the levels are so visually intense that the fighting is hard to follow, and some music choices are more than questionable, so you have to spend 5-6 minutes listening to the most annoying loop of 8bit garbage.

After 800 hours in the game, that's my conclusion. It's an infuriating mess and I can't stand it anymore. I regret getting into it. I thought about smashing a screwdriver in the game cartridge multiple times, but I'll just sell it instead. I pity the sucker who will buy it. Do not recommend.

The cynic in me thinks they did this on purpose too, because no one knew or cared about her at all prior to her inclusion in Smash Bros. Ultimate.

OctoCallie20,29-09-2021,"So... Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. What can be said about it that's based and completely honest? Why don't we start with the ""Fighter's Passes"" that have been overhpyed since they were announced?

Every single fighter within the Fighter's Passes have all been biased, weak, horrifyingly laughably bad ""picks"" save for Pyra+Mythra; Even outside of both Fighter's Passes, Piranha Plant is a terrible addition to this overhyped, bloated train-wreck of a ""game"". But I digress, what else makes this game a Skyward Sword-tier laughably bad disaster? Let's see...

Oh, huh, what do you know? The online: Inexcusable, infuriatingly broken, barely held together by glue and overused tape. How in the name of God did Nintendo manage to make Comcast-tier servers? It baffled me then and it still baffles me to this day.

Sakurai set out to make the biggest Smash Bros. to date, and, well... He truly accomplished such a Herculean task...

...Too bad it ended up being too overbloated and too much of a comedically bad train-wreck for its own good. The fighter DLC ex-packs and hilariously bad online servers that Nintendo have built really bring this game down into the depths of the Mariana Trench, bordering on the fiery underworld for how it overall is just a slow-motion, comedically laughable and terrible train-wreck. Had I known all this at the time that Inklings were revealed to be in this game, it would have saved me an insane amount of money from getting.

I'm absolutely, insanely ecstatic to see Sakurai will finally be stepping down and away from this entire series we all love; Maybe now, we can get someone who isn't an incompetent, entitled, easily-manipulated man such as him. Get someone newer and younger and willing to stand up to Nintendo and tell them ""No"" to many of their stupidly backwards, entitled and biased ideas that nobody has ever asked for.

bulger_paul,30-12-2018,"It’s Smash Bros. I mean, what can I possibly say that you don’t already know? If you’ve scrolled down the metacritic user reviews far enough to see what I’m writing right now, what can I conceivably tell you about Smash Bros that you haven’t already read multiple times anywhere else?

I had 75 hours logged after my first ten days, which I think speaks for itself. But, I gave this a 9, instead of a 10, because the online mode is complete trash. Nintendo was more than ten years late implementing online play into their games, when the finally added an online feature in their last Smash game, which was 5 years ago, and even over 5 years after their first attempt at online play they still haven’t figured it out. Online play has been a mainstream thing for over 15 years now. Nintendo has had more than 15 years to learn from the rest of the video game industry how to do online play properly. They have no excuse to let what should be a core feature of this game remain in such an utterly unplayable state, especially now that they’re charging for that feature.

Anyways, even though the online component is complete trash, the game itself is as strong as it’s ever been.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

It's brimming with content out the wazoo, it's got enough in it to feel like a museum not only of Smash, but to gaming in general, it makes a series that's essentially a love-letter to the medium feel like a wedding to video games, the gameplay feels like a perfect balance between what made ""Super Smash Bros. for Wii U"" a great casual game and ""Super Smash Bros. Melee"" a technical fighting game, it's got a really compelling and exciting story mode, it feels as though there is almost nothing the game doesn't have (except for a cake, $1,000,000 and an all-expenses paid vacation to Nintendo's headquarters but, I mean, beggars can't be choosers there). Only time will tell if this will eclipse ""Melee"" as my favorite ""Smash Bros."" game (or if it will eclipse ""Super Mario Odyssey"" as my favorite video game), but regardless, ""Super Smash Bros. Ultimate"" is a wonder to behold, and it's a game every Switch owner should have in their collection.

Reciter5613,19-06-2019,"It felt that the game would have a rough start with all the toxic fans hatin' on Sakurai for not having every character they want. But regardless, SSBU is worth all the hype.

Several characters to play and they are all well balanced as far as I can tell.

So many stages and music, I have a hard time believing it could fit into one small card.

The spirits are addictive to collect. I'm still trying to get everything on the board and I'm sure they will add more in the future.

The adventure mode may not have had many cutscenes as subspace but it did keep my attention to the end.

The biggest improvement from Smash 4 is the online mode is a lot less laggy. Before it was like every game making it pointless. But now in Ultimate, it is rarely laggy in most matches.

Overall, this is a must-have for the Switch! Just don't expect to get yourself to stop playing for hours past your bedtime.

Full Review;
Adventure Mode.... what a treat. Truly amazing. Characters have different Adventures that are true to their game. I was blown away when I found this little gem. Adventure mode is short, but it makes you look forward to seeing every characters story, even those you wouldn't normally play.
Smash... with all the characters.... what more could you ask for? More personalization? Check. You can save different game settings and change stage elements to jump straight into smash faster.
Spirit Mode... I played all the way through.... and boy was it unnecessarily long. Like really long. The kind of I think Im done.... now I think Im done... am I done kind of long. Never the less I found it enjoyable. It gave a lot of grind to the game. Something that made me feel I really got a lot of value out of the game.

J-Dig,10-01-2020,"This is my first Smash game so I have no nostalgia for the series and ooh boy! Nostalgia seems to be doing a lot of heavy lifting in the reviews.

I had been enjoying a free game that's always being compared to Smash so thought I'd use Christmas cash to enjoy what all the reviews have been gushing over. I enjoyed unlocking all the characters, got bogged down in the RPG mode then headed online...

It's a broken laggy mess with no regard for what mode you want to play or your skill level. Consistently losing to a mixture of input lag, far more experienced players or what seems like random chance is frustrating and not fun for me, even winning feels unrewarding for similar reasons. No other game I have is like this so it's kind of a relief to see others experiencing similar because most reviews had me feeling like I was going mad. I don't imagine I can influence seasoned Smash players but novices should be aware that talk of Ultimate being casual friendly does not fit my experience at all.

chemiclord,09-12-2018,"So many things to do... but all of them with minor irritations that keep it from getting a perfect score from me, most of them centering around what seems to be a very unreliable AI that seems brick stupid one second, then damn near precognitive the next; creating single player content that can get extremely frustrating.

As far as online play, I am able to excuse the occasional hiccups due to the sheer number of users flooding the servers. But the decision to do matchmaking based on loosely tied rules (and not the For Glory and For Fun in Smash 4) was absolutely a mistake. If it can be changed back, it needs to be done.

But the annoyances really can't mask the fact that this is one of the most accessible yet challenging titles in the series that beautifully balances the competitive elements of Melee with the all-inclusive entertainment of Brawl and Smash 4. And the sheer staggering amount of content (none of which feels hurried or jammed in without thought) cannot be denied, either.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
JuanLuisGG14,10-03-2019,"Excellent game overall, massive roster and quite well balanced. Would give it even more if they had made more bosses for the classic mode (i feel them lacking in numbers)",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
FrothySlider,24-12-2018,"To make my opinions as clear as possible I'm separating this review into Smash, Games and More, Spirits, and Online. Before that I want to get some all-encompassing elements out of the way. The fighting feels great. My one gripe is with the reduced lag on many moves, which makes punishing certain things feel frustrating. I know this comes down to personal preference, but I feel the shield and dodging nerfs did enough to weaken defensive play. Besides that the game looks and sounds beautiful.

Smash
The addition of a crew battle mode in the form of squad strike is the biggest addition. Its nice that you can play it as one player or a group. Smash-down is another welcomed inclusion, allowing you to keep track of who you have and haven't played yet. Overall I have no complaints for this mode.

Games and More: (MINOR SPOILERS FOR CLASSIC MODE)
Classic mode is better than it has ever been. The specialized story modes are a nice touch, and the unique bosses for some characters are a welcomed surprise. Sonic, Pokemon, and Mother feel like odd exclusions from this, considering Pokemon and Mother had their own bosses in subspace emissary. Besides that stadium events being gone doesn't upset me, unlike the absence of stage builder. It isn't a tragedy, but its a mode many people, myself included, found a lot of enjoyment in.

Spirits: The Buzz Buzz one is the best one
Theres not much bad I can say about spirits but theres not much good either. Its very novel. Many Unique fights feel unbeatable without spirits that remove the entire gimmick (Ashley's control flipping). It mostly funny references with little gimmicks to make them more accurate. The main thing I have umbrage with is that some of the spirits inadvertently spoil large plot points for many games. I want to be transparent, I haven't beaten world of light yet. Grinding through low level spirits and searching for the specific character I need to get past a certain point isn't particularly compelling. I think the Spirit Board is Wonderfull. The spirits feel designed as quick distractions from the meatier parts of the game.

Online: Its bad
EVERYTHING IS RANKED. Unless you go digging through lobbies anything you do in quickly will effect your GSP. Besides all the regular Nintendo Online stuff (Friend codes, no invite system, no voice chat...) there are other glaring absences from this mode. No Squad Strike or Smashdown. Why even add them if you aren't going to let people play them. I don't think Nintendo understands that people like to play their games online. Wheres tournaments? We had them offline only, then online only, and now back to offline only. No indication of rank. League of Legends, Dragon ball FighterZ, Counter Strike. All these games have multiple ranks and show what you need to rank up. Elite smash is this ambiguous number thats constantly changing, with no tracker showing what you need.

Online 2: Its really bad
You can't spectate running matches, You can't taunt. You can't even choose what game mode you wan't to play. Nintendo is so behind the ball on this, it's inexcusable, and this is their big online game of the year. Its so easy to fix to. Make a ranked lobby thats Final D and Battlefield. Add squad strike and smash down at least in private lobbies. Add online tournament creation. We already had it in Smash 4. Let me invite people through my switch and let me taunt when I three stock a little Mac by throwing him off the stage.

Smash Ultimate really is a great game. The gameplay feels better than ever and the classic mode is better than ever. World of Light isn't a fully realized adventure, but more a collection of neat fights taking place on an enormous map. Melee Adventure, Subspace Emissary, and even Smash Run on the 3DS did more for me in that department. The online is absolutely terrible. Its missing so many features that exist in modern games, or even older games for that matter. For so many people online is the main way they are going to enjoy the game, and it is so lacking that it brings the entire experience down.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Cosmozerk,19-04-2020,"As far as gameplay goes, this is without a doubt my favorite Smash game, it brings back many old mechanics, while also introducing new ones. Yet, the barrier for entry is not high, so even if ya wanna treat it like a party game, anyone can pick up a character and have fun.

Which is a good thing considering just how big the roster is, I mean, they brought back every character from every previous games, and to this day they're still adding new fighters, even if the DLC is rather expensive. But at least some of them also add new stages and music, tho even if ya don't bother with the extra content, the base game already has a good selection of stages and an incredible soundtrack full of remixes and new tracks for pretty much every series present, that is just pure ear candy.

Not sure if I can say the same for the visuals tho, they're kinda like a more gritty version of Smash Wii U's style, which kinda makes it seem like everything is covered in dust. Not a big deal, but I think the Wii U version still has the better aesthetics, but at least the new visual effects make up for it in some regard, plus the game runs like butter.

All of the above aspects are pretty good, however, there are some problems I have with this game that prevent it from being better than Smash for Wii U overall. I am mostly referring to the single-player offerings. Sure, there are tons of characters and stages, but that's for the main smash mode. Everything surrounding it is really half-baked. Classic mode is the only worthwhile, long-term mode for single player, and to be fair, it's pretty good since now every character has a thematic variation of it and it will end in a different boss battle depending on the fighter you're using, like Master hand, Ganon, Dracula, etc.

That's all well and good, however, the rest simply doesn't hold up. Sure, World of Light is amusing for the first 2 hours, but it quickly became mind-numbingly repetitive, as all you're doing is fighting over and over and over again. It doesn't even have a lot of cool cinematics like Brawl, and yet it's twice as long. It's clear a lot of time and care went into this mode, as every fight represents a spirit character from a certain franchise, and the map is beautifully crafted. I appreciate that, but it's just way too long, tedious and boring for it to hold any re-play value.

And that's basically all the game really has to offer, no really. All-stars has been reduced to just another version of multi-man melee, instead of the strategic endurance round it used to be, on top of the other versions the game has, and rest is stage creator, sandbag and training mode.

This is such a shame, considering this is a franchise that usually likes to pack its games with LOADS of content for the player who likes to play the game solo. Smash Wii U, alone, had Classic mode, All-stars, Master & Crazy orders, challenges to complete, Events which was basically mission mode, Smash Tour, playable NES and SNES games, Trophy collection, and all the other little modes like Stage Builder, Training, Stadium, etc. And on TOP of that, it also had custom moves and stat bonuses for amiibo.

Ultimate simply doesn't compare. Its main smash mode is as great as ever, and now you can even do offline tourneys and make permanent rule sets, but besides classic mode that's it. There is no other incentive to go back to the game after sloughing through World of Light and unlocking all the characters unless you're really into fighting CPUs and doing all the challenges. Especially considering that the online is still pretty lacking.

Sure, Smash shines most when it's a multiplayer game, but quite frankly, that goes for any game of that nature. And as someone who mostly plays Smash alone, I was left rather disappointed. And no, Spirit events are not enough, because spirits are just glorified stickers, I much prefer getting a trophy and being able to view it in all its glory. But of course, Ultimate doesn't even have trophies or custom moves outside of the Miis.

Simply put, Smash Ultimate (or Special in Japan) doesn't live up to that title on the whole. It's still Smash Bros, it's still a blast to play with friends, or if ya like to fight lvl9 CPUs all day, but the complete package is far below what was set previously, on what I still think is the best Smash game of them all, Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. A better roster doesn't make for a better game.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Lone_Wolf_Sones,03-02-2020,"It's Smash Bros. But now it has a new subtitle. But what does that subtitle mean? Does it earn the ""Ultimate"" moniker?

Smash has been around since the N64. It started as a simple party game and by a happy accident became one of the premier fighting games in the competitive scene regularly scene at tournaments like EVO.

But what is Smash? Is it a party game? Is it a fighting game? It's both. It's whatever you want it to be. There are so many options to tailor the experience to how you want to play it's amazing.

Let's start with the roster. Any fighting game worth it's salt has to have an interesting roster right? Smash is no different and it absolutely delivers. It has brought every character back including those like Solid Snake and Ice Climbers. The sheer work it must have taken for licensing to make this happening must have been incredible.

Initially I was disappointed that trophies were cut as well as home run contest. In the place of trophies we got spirits. They are ok but I miss reading the little bits of information about the history of the cool stuff.

We also got a new addition in the form of world of light which is like a new adventure mode and it's pretty massive. I found it incredibly enjoyable.

Home Run contest has since been added back in along with stage editor/creators. In addition they have continued to support the game via a fighter pass.

In addition to returning characters from Smash 4 like Cloud, Bayonetta and more as well as newcomers like K. Rool and Ridley? The fighter pass has seen the addition of Joker, Hero, Banjo, Terry, and Byleth.

So what do I not like about Smash Ultimate? Well I didn't like the changes made to Link. I wasn't all that fond of Breath of the Wild for starters so I really lamented the loss of things like a hook shot.

That being said there is so much other content on offer that even if someone finds that they no longer like the way a character plays? They can generally find something in the 50+ character that should speak to them.

The online is still as bad as it always was though, only now you have to pay for Switch Online.

Brawl, Smash Ultimate contains many other modes and enough characters to make up for it. The main drawbacks with the game - for me - are the online features, and a lack of the previously stated single-player campaign (like Subspace Emissary).

Tohubohu7,27-12-2018,"I wanna start off by saying I’m pretty sure anyone giving this game a 0 bought a Wii U and regrets it, the game is basically every smash game combined into an HD remaster with in my opinion the most smooth mechanics in any smash game since melee, it feels GOOD to hit a character, unlike on the Wii U, and even though it looks a lot like sm4sh it definitely doesn’t feel like it every character has little things changed about them like Sonics down special and side special ACTUALLY being different in which the down special multi hits and the side special just RAMS you, Luigi finally having the much requested poltergust in his moveset as his grab, which makes the most sense on how to use it, jigglypuffs sing reaches much farther and puts characters to sleep longer but her sleep has been range nerfed again, which, surprisingly balances out perfectly, I can now legally say THEY BUFFED THE PUFF. All in all this game has so so so much more to offer compared to its previous entries from spirits mode (which is fun even if a bit repetitive) to the classic mode with exclusive paths for each 70+ characters some even having final bosses besides master hand and crazy hand. And the icing on the cake? This game has an amazingly balanced roster, for once In a smash game EVERY character is viable, except for one certain blue haired character with horrible recovery and genuinely no reason to play him instead of Roy. I really really like chrom as a character so I hope sakurai somehow fixes this because he’s the only character in this roster I’d consider unviable, it wouldn’t be hard either just change dancing blade to Ike’s side special I’m sure no ones gonna miss it that much and that could make him an even more unique echo. Well obviously sakurai isn’t gonna read this but hey I’ll hold out hope chrom will have his day in an update maybe, would changing a move be too much?

MonkiReviews,01-01-2019,"This is my favorite Super Smash Bros. game yet. The characters are all in it,plus a lot of new awesome characters with great abilities. The World of Light game mode is really fun. Fighting characters after characters unlocking spirits to use in fights is very cool and one of the best parts of the game. The regular Smash mode is still my favorite though. You can fight up to 8 player Smash which is intense and fun. The online mode is also good, but needs some fixing. Preferences for what you want to do isn’t the best. Also the game lags at times, but normally it’s fine. I recommend it!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Kamikazeshocki,21-01-2019,"My first smash bros since Gamecube version (played the wii and wii u version at friends a few hours though...).
In my opionion nothing changed much, but the core gameplay mechanic is a foundation for the best beat'emup there is. No combat game has this variety and spatial, tactical depth. The sheer amount of fighters, stages, OST and nostalgia is equally impressive. The singleplayer mode seems boring to me and I found myself unlocking characters in versus...I also never really could recommend this game for casual gamers, because there is just too much going on onscreen, if you are not used to such stuff.
Anyway if you like beat em ups, like nintendo, like switch, like videgame nostalgia, like games to play with friends on one console: this is one hell of a game.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
SaltyLodestar,30-12-2018,"Ultimate is alright.
A great smash game, great amount of content given today's standards, fun gameplay, more balanced. The whole nine yards. As a smash game, it checks all marks.

Starting with;

Single-Player (?) content.
Technically speaking, it's very impressive everyone has a unique path to take, and you can even play classic with a friend.
The 'Extra's' such as All Stars, Multi-Man, ect. Are okay, they fall under a little more frustrating then they are fun, even when you're skilled at the game since it goes through ridiculous difficulty spikes at various points in every mode, they can still be enjoyable if taken casually.
Challenges have been reduced greatly and it is possible for even the average joe to 100% them now.

'Smash'

Ult's main 4 player modes are amazing, they improve and give features that have been desired ever since melee. Great for local or casual play.
The new features such as Rulesets and Stage Morphing bring even more twist and turns to how to play this game and more options is always nice.

World of Light.
A wasted opportunity in every sense of the word.

Not fun, to put it bluntly, a lot of the battles are very gimmicky, and what should result in your victory can result in your loss, also the spirit management is much more intrusive than even Brawl's sticker boosters. You could beat Brawl even on the highest difficulty with no stickers, and while you can do the same in Ultimate, the process will not be fun.
The game mode forces you back and fourth and just deciding to into a random direction and hope for the best. Needing very specific spirits to progress, move through obstacles, and even fight. There is no indication of where to find them outside of shops. You quite literally have to hope for the best.

A lot of fights even for skilled players are unnecessarily ridiculously tedious and even the music is worthy of a mention as it can drone on in your ear as there is no music diversity while traveling the world. Only when entering battles.
WoL also has a few cinematic pieces, but they do absolutely nothing and we could honestly go without them. It doesn't make use of the characters outside of seeing them get stomped, but honestly not even that.
There are a few truly fun battles, but overall World of Light is a terrible substitute for what was to replace Subspace.

The Characters.

We got everyone from Smash Wii U and 3DS and then some.
The characters are mostly solid. Most of the echoes, even while fun, are relatively disappointing. They were all incredibly safe picks and had zero risk to their inclusion.

Most of the characters are fair and balanced with a few outrageously ridiculous characters in every category, (Light, Med, Heavy.)

But overall, even the roster is rather balanced. Good on them.

Stages.

Many stages have returned with HD upgrades.
One of the best aspects of Ult. Not much more to say than that.

Online.
There are only two things that can truly be considered bad in Ultimate, Online is one of them.

Matchmaking will sometimes just yolo it and place you in whatever it feels like. Even with the 'Preferred rules' setting you are not safe.

Arena's are also excruciatingly cumbersome. To change rules you need to shut the arena down, remake it from the beginning, everyone has to renter and so on.

You MUST do this to set it to 1v1, 4 Player Smash, 3 Player or Teams. It is a horrendous system and needs major changes before it's remotely decent.

Connection is also shotty, but given the nature of the switch it is to be expected.
Purchase a Lan Adapter to minimize frustration with connection if you can.
Bugs: This deserves it's own space. Ultimate is 100% the buggiest smash game to date. During Quickplay you can choose a skin and end up with the default after winning, a VERY rare bug is actually the game giving you a different character all together. There is a potentially game breaking bug with 'finisher moves' disabling collision for a few seconds which is crucial as it can turn a victory into a loss. And there are ruleset bugs where the game registers rulesets that are NOT what has been selected. (Exclusive to online arenas it seems.) However there is a variation of this with stages (also arena exclusive) And there is a major bug in quickplay that can even cause your characters skin to change from what you selected and VERY rarely, into a different character all together. (This one seemed to have been patched though.) This makes the game feel rushed and incomplete. Despite these rather huge bugs at times, the game is still leagues better than most other games. Conclusion: Smash Ultimate is fun, large, and has plenty of diversity. It's a great game and smash game, but the few flaws it has are large enough that it cannot be called the perfect smash game. Still very much worth the purchase however.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
JPK,11-06-2019,"Best Smash Game Yet
Smash Ultimate is a flat-out masterpiece that even outdoes Melee.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
MetaPerky37,02-09-2019,"Okay, my first review in over two years, where I’ve grown older and wiser. Smash Ultimate is possibly the best in the series. Every previous character EVER plus a handful of varied newcomers (including the clone-like-but-not-exactly Echo Fighters). Let’s go over my thoughts on this game in a nutshell:

+As mentioned before, the roster largely consists of every fighter in Smash HISTORY.
+The long-awaited Ridley and King K. Rool are part of the selection of newcomers, and they’re A BLAST to play.
+We get Adventure Mode in the form of World of Light, where you constantly fight unique opponents with kinda-Sticker items called Spirits, which are PNG’s of characters across Nintendo’s history and then some with unique abilities.
+Classic Mode has been revamped in a way; each fighter has a unique path that ends with a boss. Some fighters battle Marx from Kirby Super Star, others fight Rathalos from Monster Hunter, etc.
+Some long-missing stages have returned, like Kongo Falls, Great Bay, and FOUNTAIN OF DREAMS, just to name a few out of over 100 stages!
+The DLC characters so far are really fun! I am HYPED to see what Banjo’s like when he comes in the fall.
+There are nearly 1,000 music tracks to play, including over 100 new remixes. Just take a listen to Gangplank Galleon, Divine Bloodlines, Guile’s Theme, Beneath the Mask, etc.!
+Piranha Plant. Just Piranha Plant.

-The AI is practically a Mary Sue sometimes. When it’s not a perfect little muffin who can read your mind, they just kinda…give up when recovering.
-Some of the remixes are just…bad. Mostly it’s just remixes of songs that already had (much better) remixes in Smash 4 THAT ARE EVEN IN THE SAME GAME.
-The graphic quality is kinda weird. Most of it looks beautiful, while others, like Bowser’s model, looks just butt-ugly. Bowser’s the only example I could think of off the top of my head, though.
-Some of the victory themes are either cut short (like the Ice Climbers’) or changed needlessly, like Ness and Lucas’s. Theirs has to be the worst Smash victory theme I’ve heard in my life.
-The Legend Spirits can go die in a hole and never come out (not that they’d be able, since they’re DEAD).
-A lot of modes were cut because of WoL (Target Test/Smash, Home Run Contest, etc.). Stage Builder is back through an update, though, so maybe Home Run Contest will too?
-The way Classic Mode ups its difficulty ruins the concept. The only you can do so quickly is to rush the stage and take little damage. Even when you do it PERFECTLY, in 5 seconds, you just get a .6 for your troubles.

I don’t have an online subscription for the online matches, so I can’t really comment on THAT front. But simply put, despite its flaws, Smash Ultimate is possibly the best game in the SERIES!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
robertoiglesias,29-04-2020,"I have to agree, this is the best Smash Bros game. But this doesn't completely replace the previous games.
It doesn't have all of the stages. Some of them that are missing include Poke Floats, Planet Zebes, Sector Z, Mute City, Icicle Mountain, Rumble Falls, Rainbow Road, Pac Maze, Jungle Hijinxs, and Woolly World. I know not all of them are good stages (especially Icicle Mountain), but including them would've been nice.
The story modes from the past, like the Subspace Emissary, are gone, but I understand this not being here. The other maps though, no excuse.

TheNCSmaster,31-12-2018,"The biggest problem with this game is the lack of diverse content and questionable choices. This game is lacking so many staple modes of the series, break the targets, home run contest, bomb blast, boss battle mode, stage builder, and removing Smash Run despite everyone wanting a fleshed out version of that mode. Not to mention some modes like All Star Mode have received a massive downgrade. All of the other modes are just based around basic fighting with a few tweaks here and there, which while the fighting is the best in the series it gets very repetitive pretty fast. The ""story"" mode is a joke, there is no story whatsoever, it is literally just if Smash Tour and Event mode had a baby, and considering that this mode apparently took so much time to develop the fact that it's reception has been so mixed is a serious problem. The newcomer roster and stages are also very eyebrow raising, some choices are great like Ridley, Simon, and King K Rool, however other choices like making Isabelle a newcomer and not an echo and Incineroar ANOTHER FREAKING POKEMON just do not make sense. The roster also screams of missing characters who should have been added, Isaac and Shadow the Hedgehog being the biggest examples of ""Why the hell are these guys not playable?"". Also I don't care how many stages you bring back, having only 4 new stages is unacceptable, which is even an even bigger problem with the lack of a stage builder. Even little things drag this game down such as making the unlockable characters an absolute chore to unlock from their difficulty, so much so that the game had to patch down the difficulty only a week after release. This game's greatest sin is just the lack of diverse content, you see everything this game has to offer after like a week of playing. This game does have the best core fighting in the entire series which earns it a 7, however the questionable decisions, lack of modes, and so little new content keeps it at a 7. This is a good Smash game but it is FAR from the ""Ultimate"" Smash game.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

PlayStationFan2,08-01-2019,"Where do I even begin? This is the perfect Smash Bros! Every character has their pros and cons and are all viable options and really fun to play as. The combat is perfected. The Adventure Mode (World of Light) while sometimes tedious offers hours of gameplay and fun. Spirits replace trophies and there are over a thousand of them. While spirits are fun to collect the problem with them comes from their implementation into gameplay. There are special matches in the adventure mode and spirit board which have special rules (example: The stage is covered in fog or The enemy is metal) while these are fun and do add new things multiple of them that are meant to be difficult are ruined by the fact that the hazards can be completely removed by some spirits, and if they aren't removed they are extremely unfair and difficult. Mob smash and Classic Mode return and are loads of fun and very simple however they can get a bit dull due to the lack of differences when choosing different characters. The number of stages being over a hundred and the fact there are different variations of stages is incredible and there are only about three that I don't find enjoyable. Special smash is a timekiller and only adds bits of gameplay but is still nice to have have. Squad Strike is probably the most dull of the game modes as it doesn't really add much to the game. Another huge plus is the fact that multiple characters from multiple franchises get represented in Mii Costumes, Spirits, and Assist Trophies shows how much love and care is put into this game and how this is truly a celebration of gaming. The soundtrack is incredible and has over 900 songs ranging form new songs, songs from their original series, or songs from the previous Smash Bros games. Lastly of course the main attraction is the normal Smash mode where you can play solo or with up to eight players to have an all out brawl and it is fun and incredible as always and with the combat being so improved in this game it helps make it one of the greatest fighting games of all time. Overall this game is just amazing and a real system seller.

Davis119,14-02-2019,"I played Smash for about 150 hours now, so that should somewhat qualify me to give an opinion.
For what it set out to do this game nails all the details. To be completely honest, It would be worth it for the music alone.
74 characters in a fighting game is a tremendous amount of characters, even though a lot are very much alike, but with noticeable differences.
The online mode is still underdeveloped and should have at least some more features and be less laggy.
The campaign is a lot of fun, but only if you get all the references to all the games from the spirits.
Multiplayer is great as always, with so much features it's **** ridiculous and the controlls are really tight. (except for the delay in online matches)
It's a shame that a lot of modes aren't in the game like target practice or trophy rush, but the classic mode has been noticably improved and it's a cool thing that every character has their own theme for it.

In conclusion, it is a very good game with noticable problems online (as always with games from Nintendo), but the sheer amount of music and replayability in multiplayer is pretty much unmatched. The classic mode and the other modes are somewhat meh, but still very good in comparison to a lot of the old smash games.

Very enjoyable game highly recommended from me!",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
epicboyblue,18-01-2019,"This game is good. It helps fill the void since I didn't play the Wii U game. Sadly, the biggest disappointment of the game is the World of Light. There is little to no narrative at all. Most of the game is just running around to each bulb and defeat AI enemies. Brawl had an actual narrative with cut scenes throughout and encounters better than any of the Marvel movies. It was faster and easier to just do the Classic Mode challenge with the characters I want or play against my friends because it was faster to unlock all the characters in the roster. It is impressive there are 75+ characters in one 2D fighting game. It is unheard of, yet I want to play each character. Each character has abilities, unlike Dragon Ball Fighters, where characters might not have a low attack. The difference in Ultimate is that there is just a difference in who's low is faster and slower making this game better in terms of character availability. It is a good game. The party aspect is the best, and the narrative becomes a trudge to play.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Grease,31-12-2018,"Smash is a definitive console seller for the nintendo switch.

Super smash bros ultimate feels like the franchise has reached it's peak and all the better for it.
Smash is the biggest crossover game in history featuring over 70 characters with the wide majority being unique. Each character has assigned button presses, and they don't change so that's an overwhelming positive. What i mean is, despite all characters having different moves and different strengths, the button inputs for a ""smash attack"" is the same so you don't have to learn different controls for every character allowing every single character accessible to any player as long as you put in some time.

Smash features multiple modes this time around such as tournaments and the new addition of squad strike, allowing you to pick a group of characters to fight with and gradually move down the list. Unfortunately tournaments and squad strike cannot be taken online with other players aside from your friends list, it may come in an update but it's dissapointing this isn't possible like tournaments were in smash 4. The AI feels relatively reliable, the highest CPU level feels like a genuine challenge and the lowest,,, doesn't.

smash bros features a new mode named ""spirits"", spirits come in the form of game characters who aren't playable fighters, such as viridi from kid icarus. These can grant buffs and benefits in battle allowing more interesting fights. You can obtain spirits from the spirit board, it allows you to choose from a selection from spirits, to obtain them you must fight in a quirky battle such as lightning floors and anti-gravity shifts, you can equip spirits to nullify these hazards and that's the beauty of spirits, assigning the perfect team. If you win the battle though unfortunately it's not over, there's a shield protecting the spirit with a gap in it, you need to successfully fire a bullet through the gap and hit the spirit to obtain it, this is annoying because if you miss the spirit and hit the shield altho the gap becomes wider the next time you see it, you lose the opportunity to obtain it despite winning the battle. Furthermore if you fail the battle you have to wait for it to appear on the spirit board again which could be ages considering the hundreds of spirits in the game. The other way to obtain is through a hefty single player mode named world of light, it revolves around a monster galeem killing the characters with kirby as the lone survivor, the single player revolves around exploring a realm to recover the fallen fighters, to do this you must fight the spirits in quirky battles like the spirit board. The single player is LONG, if you like world of light this will be ideal as it's easily a 30 hour story mode but it is repetitive and even when you think it's about to end.. trust me it doesn't. it will be a tedious and repetitive adventure if that isn't your thing, but luckily it was exactly what i wanted so i was satisfied.

Classic mode returns but instead of having random battles with a fighter, each of the unique fighters has their own classic mode, with assigned enemies relating to their games, bayonetta for example will face angelic characters like Pit, since she kills angels in her own games. Each one is unique and relateable. There's also mob smash for challenging a horde of fighters and the return of amiibos and mii fighters, amiibos can be used for practice against certain character or unlocking spirits early.

The main attraction is online however. Online you set preferred rules, stock, time or stamina battles, whether you want items and the stages to appear, however you are not guaranteed to get your preferred rules, you are likely to get your preferred rules thanks to a post-release patch but its not guranteed as the game tries to matchmake you with close opponents so you don't lag. It's annoying to select a 1v1 battle just to play free-for-all. Battle arenas do allow you to play with friends or viewers if you stream allowing more casual and fun battles with friends.

Smash ultimate defines the fighting genre with multiple modes and a balanced roster, the roster is huge leading to a variety of characters and playstyles. with the inclusion of items and frantic battle stages, no match is like any other. The spirits are a fun new activity albeit having problems with the spirit boards mechanics and the world of light is a joy if it's your cup of tea but a tedious pain if it isn't

pros:
-balanced and massive roster
-hefty single player and spirits mode
-wonderful soundtrack
- classic mode refined to the character
-multitude of modes so it's never boring

cons:
- wol can be repetitive long and boring
-online is unstable despite quality connections

-certain modes cannot be taken online despite being built perfectly for it",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

This game is perfect.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Kire_92,21-01-2019,"At the core this is an amazing game. The gameplay is good and satisfying and the game itself is packed with fun elements. The game truly shines when playing with friends and the fact that it’s easy for newcomers to pick it up and play means that I can enjoy it with all of my friends regardless of their prior gaming experience.

My only big complaint is that the online mode is not implemented in a good way and that it lacks a good competitive system. Due to that my motivation has quickly dwindled for playing the game online which negatively affects my opinion of the game as a whole.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
MPReviews,03-03-2019,"Pros:
-Every single character from the previous games returns plus newcomers, making for the hugest roster we’ve ever seen in a Smash game.
-The newcomers are all fantastic barring one exception, which I’ll get into later
-We still have more new characters on the way, such as Joker from Persona 5!
-Echo fighters are a great way of categorizing the clones, and the new ones that we got are all great
-We got some really cool alts such as Wedding & Builder Mario, Crafted World Yoshi, and Pikachu Libre
-There’s over 100 stages, and the majority of them are really fun to play on!
-Classic mode is the best it’s ever been
-I like how Multi Man Smash and All Star Mode have been simplified
-Gameplay is the best and most polished the series has seen yet
-Ditches coin battles in favor of having stamina battles as a standard mode, which is a much better choice
-Smashdown is a mode I’ve always wanted to have in Smash Bros, so I’m really happy it’s finally here.
Phenomenal soundtrack
-Unlocking all the characters is more streamlined and fun.
-Unlocking things in general (Music, Mii Costumes, etc) is much more streamlined and fun than in some previous Smash games, particularly Smash 4.
-The menu is organized in a much better way than Smash 4’s menu was

Cons (NOTE: Practically all of these are just nitpicks):
-Some stages such as Sector Z, Mute City, Poke Floats, Rainbow road, Pac-Maze, Orbital Gate Assault, and Wooly World were unfortunately cut but yet stages like Hanenbow, 75M, Pac Land, and The Great Cave Offensive were brought back for some reason.
-Many modes like Target test, Home Run Contest, Stage Builder, Smash Run, etc were unfortunately cut.
-Spirits, while not bad, don’t quite make up for the loss of trophies
-World of Light was a bit of a disappointment. While I do still appreciate the inclusion of an adventure mode, and while it isn’t bad, it’s too long and gets too repetitive.
-Isabelle is playable but Shovel Knight and Waluigi are assist trophies.
-You can’t turn stages hazards on and off from the stage select
-It doesn’t save your character after a match
-Why the heck is Mario’s Fire Mario Alt gone!?
-Why the heck is Black Yoshi gone!?
-They went all out representing other 3rd party series, yet there’s still only 2 Final Fantasy songs, and not even any Final Fantasy themed spirits outside of Cloud’s spirit.

Final verdict: This is easily the best Smash Bros game yet. It trims the fat in regards to game modes and focuses on polishing and refining upon the core Smash gameplay as well as classic mode. While I do wish Isabelle hadn’t been playable and I would have prefered something more like Subspace for the adventure mode, it doesn’t take away from how much love and care the developers clearly put into this game. If you own a Nintendo Switch, you need to buy this game. 10/10",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Rens,02-01-2019,"The base game of Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is perfect, but World of Light is a bit disappointing and a lack of other original single-player options make the game a little less from perfect.

The game and the new spirits are filled with thought, care and love. Everything is a homage to Nintendo and video games as a whole.
The new single-player campaign World of Light does not add extra value to Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Newcomers can learn the mechanics and veterans would like the variation on the ‘normal’ fights, but the matches in World of Light are the same as on the Spirit Board (with exception for the bosses). That makes it feel like a duplication.
There are no new single-player modes in Ultimate, apart from the Spirits. Classic mode got an update, every path is now based on the fighter the player picked. This is a nice touch, but it does not create a whole revolution or something.

The new content is good. There are 5 new echo fighters, 6 new original characters and only 4 new stages. It is a bummer there are only 4 new stages, but there are still 103 stages in total, which is mind blowing. Almost every stage ever returns, except some stages that are hard to feature with the new Stage Morph feature.

The gameplay has undergone some good changes. It is faster and has a more pleasant look with a zoom camera when a strong attack hits and a cool animation when you pull of a perfect shield, which is also new. The computer, or CPU, is harder this time around. I feel like the CPU on level 5 is the previous level 6 of Smash 4, level 6 was level 7, level 7 was level 8 and so on.

The game looks beautiful. Especially Kongo Falls and Fountain of Dreams are breathtaking.
Super Smash Bros. Ultimate has the best music collection of all time. It is nostalgic and at the same time refreshing because of the remixes. I like the fact that you can choose the music which plays during the fight. In the previous game (smash 4) you could only adjust the likelihood of a track playing while fighting. The option to do that is still available, but just selecting the song is so much better.

I have never seen a game where you can adjust this many settings. You can change the music, the controls, which version of the stage you want, the looks of your character, what items you want to see in the fight, if items show up at all, the stage hazards, the character the computer is playing, how the Stage Morph feature works and so much more.

B-Bog,26-05-2019,"I didn't really ever get into the Smash Bros. franchise that much in the past, aside from the occasional match with friends. The last entry that I played was Melee. Regardless, I kind of bought into the hype for this game, probably partly because the Switch was having a slow year (aside from Indie games and ports). But I was BLOWN away when I downloaded Ultimate and started playing the story mode. It's just a love-letter to video games. Aside from the HUGE roster of fighters, pretty much every character who has ever appeared on a Nintendo console is present in the game either as a spirit (a kind of equippable playing card that enhances your fighter in particular ways) or as an item. There are over 800 music tracks in the game from god knows how many franchises. The scope of Smash Ultimate is just enormous. I've now played the story mode for about 35 hours and I'm still not finished. Then there's also Classic mode for every character, mob smash, special smash, and of course the Online mode (and many more gimmicks).

Smash is one these games that is easy to learn but hard to master. It really impressed me how much you can immerse yourself in all the details concerning the combat, if you want to. On the flipside, if someone has never played the game, it takes about 30 seconds to explain the basics and they're good to go. That's just amazing game design.

I really never thought that I would enjoy a fighting game this much.

P.S.: LOL at the crybabies giving zero points because their requested characters were not included. Look, I also don't understand why Waluigi is not a fighter at this point in time; when there's THREE different Mii characters in the standard roster.

The point is: I'm not going to get all butthurt about it. It's still an amazing game, and if you let such small details ruin a great thing for you, then good luck with your life bro. It's not going to be easy.

XV_,04-04-2020,"After playing a lot of Smash 4, you'll find yourself quite familiar with Ultimate's mechanics and tweaks but it also has some things that may shake your ground a little.

Initially, the gameplay feels incredible and more polished than ever, a lot of characters feel so different (except for the ""echo"" ones for obvious reasons) and in its massive roster, you'll mostly find at least one character that is suitable for your playstyle. Everything in this game is massive to the point that is overwhelming, you have a lot of stages, characters, music, options, etc. a lot of them are originally from past games but they're updated to the point that they feel fresh and new, also, the fact that they're adding a lot of content with the season pass it is just amazing.

There are several game modes to play this game, there's a pseudo story mode which is serviceable but not as memorable like space emissary in Brawl, you can play classic modes and obviously multiplayer, also, an addition that I really like and I have spend hours on it, is that now you can set up the massive soundtrack to every stage of your liking, is not perfect but it's cool.

Although I'm certain that this is the best Smash game to this point, it has also things that keep it from being a masterpiece, the bigger one might be its online play, from matchmaking to playing with friends, is quite bothersome, in matchmaking often you'll fight with rules that you didn't apply, for example, I like to play in final destination only, zero items, stock, etc. but at least 2/6 fights I'll play on battlefield with items or timer, it doesn't sound like a big issue but trust me it really is, I'm not criticizing anyone's playstyle but what I'm trying to say is that nobody wins. Another issue on matchmaking is that if you find someone that you want to fight over and over, your stucked with the character you choose, unlike in Smash 4 where you could switch between chars to make things more fun, it makes no sense. Its worth note that playing online with friends is also a hassle and it has its fair amount of issues but let's leave it at that.

There are several nitpicks that maybe I'm the only one in this, as I told you, the roster is massive but you literally start with the original roster of 8 characters, and you have to unlock every one of them, they're not that hard to unlock mind you, but it keeps you from playing your mains for at least some hours, if this wasn't an all-star game I wouldn't have a problem with this, but its kind of pointless and frustrating to wait at times. Finally, I know that I'm alone in this one, but I liked a lot the customization mechanic of special moves they introduced in Smash 4, I know that they were banned in professional tournaments but from a semi-hardcore point of view, they added a lot of fun, I hope that they have a comeback of some sorts in the future or future entries.

When all is said and done, and every character is at your disposal, be prepared to have an incredible time, especially when playing with friends locally or online (forgetting some issues there mind you). Smash Bros has this amazing quality that it doesn't matter that you're not great in fighting games, you'll certainly find a character or a playstyle you'll like the most in here and when you have that moment after an 8 player battle where you are the last one standing, it's truly glorious. Smash Bros Ultimate is a must for every Nintendo Switch owner, period, even when I have problems with it, they feel so minimal in comparison to its positive things.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Loo_oo,16-01-2019,"Ce nouvel opus frôle la perfection !
Techniquement rien à dire, c'est beau c'est propre... la direction artistique est top.
Ce Super Smash devient LA référence des jeux de baston. Car même si l'on n'aime pas l'univers, quelle générosité de Nintendo : plus de 70 persos, un nombre de stages tout juste indécent, jusqu'à 4 joueurs, des modes en veux tu en voilà, des musiques somptueuses retravaillées avec un mode MP3 pour écouter les thèmes console éteinte avec votre casque ! Et j'en passe tellement la liste est longue... et si vous êtes un Nintendo Fan, tout prendra une autre dimension ;-) la durée quant à elle semble excellente. Vous y reviendrez à de très nombreuses reprises.
Et pourquoi pas 10 alors ? et bien tout simplement parce que le mode ESPRIT ne me convient pas en guise de mode histoire... il convient parfaitement au scénario, mais cela devient vite répétitif. Cela est plus une course à la récompense qu'autre chose, car le scénario (qui tient quand même sur un timbre post) n'avance pas d'un poil. bref, je ne m’étendrai pas sur le sujet car cela est purement subjectf et n'engage que moi.
Ce que j'ai aimé (+) :
- Les graphismes
- Le roster titanesque !
- Les musiques somptueuses
- Le Fan Service parfait
- L'ergonomie

Ce que je n'ai pas aimé (-) :
- La complexité des combos (ou alors je suis nul, ce qui est totalement probable)
- Le MODE ESPRIT en guise de mode histoire. Trop répétitif à mon goût mais bon cela reste quand même un jeu de baston",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Aqwin,02-03-2019,"Super Smash Brothers Ultimate has the biggest roster today by bringing EVERYONE back! With 74+ characters it can feel overwhelming sometimes to choose a character. Not to mention almost everyone is unique with the exception of echo fighters who are replicas of other characters. Besides the 5 or so echo fighters, each character feels unique, special and finely well tuned, making every character worth playing.

I love the new editions of Squad Strike and Stage Morf the bring a new feeling to matches. This along with all the stages they brought, new assist trophies are all welcome additions to this already packed game. Not to mention the phenomenal music that is jam packed into it.

The only draw backs are the lack of a home run contest and the World of Light campaign. It wasn’t terrrible but it was so long and it just felt like it could have been so much more then what it was. I’m still waiting for another real story campaign from the SSB series",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I have mainly played the classic mode which I find really fun and it is kind of like a practice mode. You do unlock a new character everytime you play classic mode, but you must beat that character to unlock them. One round of classic mode takes about 10 minutes, give or take. The main mode is fun too, it is an actual single player campaign. You start off as Kirby. I thought using Kirby was a great idea. Everybody likes Kirby! The game is very addicting and it looks great!

For all the nice things I can also say about this game, you may view the other reviews :)

1 . But wtf is this Spirits mode? WARNING: Do not play this mode, my rating went from 9 to 5 because of it.
TLDR: Poorly made and balanced.
Althought creative in the fights and how the spirits are protrayed.
The map is poorly drawn, I've never seen anything as ugly, my child to be born in 10 years can already do much better!
The fights are.. theres a saying in french that doesnt translate well, but, "" n'imported quoi "" which pretty much means **** Playing in ""normal"" the fights are: extremely easy OR extremely difficuly. Nothing in between. Or i get bored on an easy fight, Or i **** rage on the difficult ones and retry until the **** ai decides to kill itself.

2. The menus are slow and a pain. I'd rather reboot the whole game, and my switch, before trying to go back one screen.

The game is really good with one major fault, the online is completely terrible, just horrendous. One of the worst implementations I've seen. You have a random number assigned at every caracter (which is the overall ranking) and from that number you lose points until you are with the ranking you deserve. Nothing says frustrating as trying to play online and get wrecked because your ranking (the one you start with) is too high. However all this is pretty much fine, the problem is you cannot play online what you want to play. What? Yup thats right, you choose a ruleset and you can either get your ruleset or anyone elses!

SaltySupplyGuy,20-12-2018,"Smash bros ultimate is an amazing smash game, taking everything that was great about 4 and running with it. All of the characters are fun to play and animated excellently (though not all of them play differently to be honest, the echo fighters are a nice addition but there was already too many Fire Emblem characters BEFORE they decided to add another one with this installment). The game bridges nicely for first time players and professionals, with fast-paced gameplay that we haven't really seen since Melee. There is a wealth of content here, with it taking on average about 1-3 days to unlock the full character roster, new modes that really add a breath of fresh air, a new story mode to unlock spirits, and more than enough stages and soundtracks to never feel like you're repeating battles too often. Lots of tweaks to the gameplay make you think of what your next move should be like the addition of parry's, only one air dodge, and fixes to characters movesets that were not so great in 4 (i.e. Pikachu's neutral air is the equivalent of Mewtwo's in Smash 4, which is fantastic). There's something here for everyone, and with an excellent first DLC character reveal of Joker, Nintendo finally seems to be giving the Smash community what they want. The only real negative I have about the game is that the online play is abysmal at the moment, the removal of For Glory was a questionable choice, but with updates trickling out that are improving the matchmaking to give you your preferences, this game is looking up.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Yaboygraham,17-12-2018,"Honestly, I don't think this is a perfect game. It's not a near perfect game either. But I found myself having a blast with it so far(About a full weekend) and feel I will be playing it for a LONG time.

In terms of characters and stages, Ultimate has pretty much everything you'd possibly want(stop complaining about meme characters, it's getting old). It has a roster of 74 characters, with only 8 being unlocked from the start. It also has 101 stages(I think?) which are unlocked from the get-go. Sure, there are a lot of clones/echo fighters, but the game lets you stack them on top of the fighter they're based on, if that interests you. Also, the characters added back along with the newcomers and changed-up veterans are extremely welcome IMO. Ridley and K. Rool are pure fan service, Inklings represent their series very well, and the Belmonts are fantastic. Chrom and Dark Samus were wanted from fans as well, despite being clones. There's also upcoming DLC, including FLIPPING JOKER FROM PERSONA 5!! Basically, Ultimate's character roster doesn't include every single character people might've wanted, but it is without a doubt amazing.

Stages are also loads more interesting than what Smash 4 had to offer, with lots of great remastered ones and a handful of new ones.

Ultimate's soundtrack is, stay with me here, quite possibly one of the greatest ever conceived. It's essentially a ""greatest hits"" collection of (mostly) great tracks from the Smash series as a whole, Nintendo games, other iconic series, and much, much more. And, as a bonus, you can play with the Switch's screen off! It's kinda pointless, but it's cool!

Now onto the gameplay. The Smash series' main appeal, in my opinion, has always been the gameplay. While Smash 4 arguably hit the sweet spot in between competitively viable and casually marketed. Ultimate is similar to 4 but is faster, smoother, and honestly feels like the best in the series by a long shot(Melee is still faster though). Directional airdodges are added, along with short hops, FS meters(optional), and...that's really it. I feel like it makes competitive a lot better, while also making casual play more chaotic, but still really fun.

In terms of single-player content, Ultimate doesn't have a ton of modes, but it DOES have a lot of great stuff to do. Classic mode is back, and it. Is. Awesome. Each character has their own series of fights leading up to a boss fight with 1 extra mode thrown in there. In order to get more rewards, you have to complete it a higher intensity level. Each time you win a fight, the intensity goes up. If you end up getting killed, you can keep going, although at a lower intensity. If you're not a fan of CPU battles, you may not like it too much. However, I've found it to be a super fun and rewarding experience.

Ultimate's big single-player mode, however is World of Light. It's super complex and there's a lot to talk about, so I'll keep this short: it doesn't really have any cutscenes like Brawl's Subspace Emissary, but it makes up for it in the pure scope of the map, Spirits mechanics, and exploration. It's not perfect, but I've loved it so far. Note: I wouldn't recommend playing this mode for more than 30 minutes at a time.

Finally, Ultimate's online is...a mixed bag for me.

I don't play online that much anyway, but the Quickplay system is, at best, mediocre. The way it works is that you set your own preferred rules and choose if you want to play solo or co-op. The problem with this mode is that it usually makes you play a 4-player free-for-all with items, even if you chose 1v1, Battlefield stages with no items. And I know I'm alone on this either, as I've seen tons of posts and articles complaining about this issue. Combine that with the frequent lag and you're better off staying away from Quickplay, until ""preferred rules"" get changed to ""guaranteed rules"". However, there is a work-around for people who just to play For-Glory style matches, AKA 99% of people who play online. You can make Battle Arenas, where you set your own rules, such as what type of stages you'll fight on and amount of stock you have and so on. Plus, I've found that there is a LOT less lag doing this than there is with quickplay, even when I end up in a 1v1 match. Keep in mind, it's still not that great, but it's at least passable in comparison to ending up in a match you didn't ask for.

Overall, I think Smash Ultimate is a phenomenal game and I can't recommend it enough. Sure, the online is kinda disappointing and the lack of extra modes is annoying, but what the game has to offer is extremely satisfying and should not be missed.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
B0rn2_w1n,20-07-2019,"I am not a SB fan (actually this is my first SB game), but I am quite dissapointed.

The online was laggy when the game came out (not sure about how it is working nowadays). The experience was MUCH worse than playing Mario Kart online, which I don´t understend.

The game is pretty diffent from other fight games, and it takes time to get the mechanics. I feel the gameplay to be quite repetitive. Yes, I know, the learning curve is steep, but I din´t feel I was enjoying the game so much.

The Spirits game mode is quite plain, and other game modes were just meh. I may give it another go on the future",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I love that everyone is here and a few new challengers but most importantly... the Story Mode. I have been waiting for another Story Mode since Brawl and World Of Light is just amazing! I love a little story here and there BUT WITH FRESH CUT CGI CUTSCENES STRAIGHT FROM THE FREEZER IS JUST A PHENOMENON! Same goes for Subspace Emissary! I love the way the sky looks in the cutscenes and all these 1st, 2nd, 3rd party characters just all in a big brawl together is just something I used to think was impossible! Sakurai worked so hard and long on this game along with his team and it's just a miracle! And Piranha Plant was the biggest surprise for me! A lot of people hate him but I **** love it. But the problem is that the Toxic Smash Fanbase is still steaming as normal... they ask for Waluigi and Isaac and Geno and Banjo Kazooie and Rayman and Crash and Shantae and all that **** Just give the man a break and don't tell him how to make his own game!

Sorafrost51,27-03-2019,"Overall, I feel that smash ultimate is the best smash bros yet. It has fun battles, items, the most stages, every single character ever that has been in the series before, and many more. I would give it a 10 but just can't due to the biggest flaw the game has.... the online. The online is the worst part by far, from not getting the matches you want, or just not having a way for people to battle online while not losing GSP, (Global Smash Power) and not going in a battle arena and having to wait for people to join. Smash 4 may have not had the best of an online either, but at least it was better than this trash. You could at least choose whether you wanted to do for fun, or for glory. You at least had the option. It also doesn't help that we are paying for the online now, and it's not any better than how it was in smash 4. If you want people to start paying for online, I say fix it, or at least make it so that you actually get the type of matches that you want, instead of getting forced into a match you didn't want with no way out, without getting punished for it.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

RustyDiamonds,15-03-2020,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the best game in the series, period. Controls are solid, games don't last too long, and characters are well-designed. Graphics and menu design are stellar and well done.

The constant flow of DLC gives an extra 'oomph' of excitement with every character reveal. A flow of extra content like this keeps players engaged and coming back.

The online has a lagging tendency(as do most Nintendo online games atm) and that docks a point. As with any game in existence, it is not perfect, but definitely an amazingly enjoyable time.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
spongedan,05-02-2019,"This is by far the best in the smash bros series, easy to pick up, caters to casuals and competitors and many game modes and features that you will keep coming back to with your friends., It plays great, looks great , and it sounds great. So please stop complaining about Waluigi.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Sillence,31-12-2018,"Smash Ultimate is an excellent game across the board. It is enjoyable for pros and amateurs alike with a low barrier to entry and a high learning curve for top-end players. It balances this extremely well.

There is no shortage of content. I cannot decide wether the volume of content is a good thing or not.. there are so many characters, items, and stages that it can be overwhelming and seem a daunting task to familiarize yourself enough with all of the fighters to be any sort of competitive. With that said, for the casual player, intimately knowing every fighter’s move set is unnecessary, and the pros will spend the time regardless, so I for most the overwhelming roster will be welcome in the long run at least.

Playing with friends either locally or online is tons of fun, and the online matchmaking works really well. When a match is overly full it can be somewhat difficult tracking your character, but this improves with experience. I don’t know if it’s just a change in game preference on my part, but while it is enjoyable, it can get tiresome to play this game for more than a couple hours at a time. This is opposed to other games such as RPGs or shooters where I have no issue playing all day and sill want to keep going. I’m not going to count this against it as I think that’s just my personal preference in regards to fighting games, and not any issue with the game itself.

While it tends to exce as a multiplayer experience, it also has a large amount of single player activities available. These activities tend to be enjoyable but also play a bit unbalanced or boring at times. There is so much to do and so much of it is non-challenging that it can feel like busy-work. If they could figure out how to make a more compelling single player experience I’d call this game a 10/10.

Overall, it is definitely technically the best Smash game ever. There is so much more in it than any other previous title, and it is polished to a ridiculous degree. With that said, I may have had more fun with some earlier smash games, but that’s because there weren’t so many good alternatives to play back then as there is now.

9/10 - Not quite perfect, but just about as good as the genre can get.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
ConnorC,06-01-2019,"Smash Ultimate is the 5th installment in one of my my game series. While I do consider it the best smash game, there are problems that could be fixed to make it even better.

Pros-

Same fun gameplay- ""if it ain't broke don't fix it""

Loads of single player content to sink hours into, great adventure mode which is 20 hours and unique classic mode battles for each chracter + more

Performance is amazing, 60 fps on docked and handheld mode with 1080p and 720p respecively, game somehow doesnt crash with the infinite assist trophy glitch

Probably the best muliplayer experience ive had, there is also lots of modes catered towards multiplayer

Cons

Online in general is frustrating, matchmaking hasnt been an issue for a while but it is very laggy and for some reason all i see are young links, pichus, and k rools with the occasional wolf

WorriedDenizen,14-11-2019,"Fantastic game. It brings back every character in previous titles, and the gameplay is solid.

The gameplay at least the main fighting is the most well balanced it's ever been, and a significant improvement over smash 4s slowness. The gap between the best characters in this game and the middle of the road characters is not as wide as in past titles.

This game is fantastic for competitive play due to the mostly well balanced roster, and the large roster size, alongside additions such as run up tilts, universal frame 3 jump squat, and the changes to powershielding which turns it into a parry. Alongside many other aspects.

What really does suck is the lack of single player gamemodes aside from HRC, WoL, and Classic Mode. Stuff like the paid online is also a huge downer.

WoL as a whole is a mixed bag, and not entirely the greatest single player gamemode. The gamemode itself can get rather stale pretty quickly, and the fights can vary from being interesting to being downright boring. The final bosses of WoL is certainly the highlight.

Nintendo paid online sucks sh!t though. This is the main downer as the previous game had free online as the 3DS/Wii U didn't have paid online. What doubly sucks is the awful netcoding that makes online matches a pain in the @ss to play, and the input delay really really makes things unbearable at times.

As breathtaking the existing content is, the game did still not hit its perfect mark. Why they removed Stadium mode (an absolute classic) is way beyond me. In this day and age, you should expect a good online experience from a game like this, but despite Switch Online being a paid subscription now, it's still pretty much the same mess.

All in all, this is a game whose flaws are completely overshadowed by its tons of quality content. Maybe not the 'Ultimate' Smash, but quite obviously the best Smash so far and a must-have game for sure.

belsel,23-12-2018,"Lets say important things. The game is good, but it isnt as good as people said. This is my first smash bros, so I havent problem because all the content of the game is new for me. The game has a lot, a lot of everything. The most flaws of the game are:

-Become repetitive, for me, after 30h. Combat isnt as fun as I thought and it is more about timing your attacks rather than complex or hard combinations of attacks.
-Offline adventure. Grinding, repetitive, boring, the intro video is a HUGE clickbait. There are 1300 spirits, fighthing them is boring after a while, tho spirits are very cool; but you dont unlock descriptions or anything more than register of the spirit. A problem is that the game track the spirits you HAVE at the moment, not the ones you HAVE REGISTERED...this is a big problem, because if you free some spirits to summon or to get some points, then you lose the tracking of those spirits because as well as you dont have them, the game dont mark them so...you dont know what spirits you had or not and you will lose many time repeating fights that you dont need.
-Online broken. This is the main problem. The healthy in long term of the game is the online, and it doesnt work properly. If you give me this feature working so bad, it is like 50% of the game for me.

The good things of the game are obvious, what is not obvious is that a lot of many things is not a good as you can think if some mechanics arent perfectly developed and if some core mechanics (like the online) doesnt work properly to many users.

I enjoyed 30h and sell it back for 50$. If you are new like me, I enjoyed to meet the saga finally, but it may be overvalued. I put it a real 7/10 which is a good mark in any academic work, but I think it is a bad mark seeing the ""critic reviews"".",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Kashmoney,22-04-2020,"Intro: Oh man, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is one VideoGame for the history books.

What is it: From the early roots of only around 12 Nintendo characters, Super Smash Bros. is a franchise that has become one of the most iconic titles out there. In Smash Bros. Ultimate, you start with only the main fighters from the original game. However, after you put some hours of smack down on your opponents, you start to see your 7 fighter roster turn into 75 playable characters from game series like Super Mario, Pokemon, Zelda, Fire Emblem, and Kirby along with characters like Solid Snake from Metal Gear, Bayonetta from Bayonetta, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Cloud from Final Fantasy.

The Good: The game feels pretty good with the controls. From my knowledge, you can play the game with a few different play styles like single Joycon, v-grip, handheld, pro controller, and the ever so popular Gamecube controller. Graphics wise, the game looks stunning and very clean. Character animations look great and really has no faults. As for content, well there is plenty for everyone. As I said before, the roster for this game is huge and will get even bigger once more characters from the season pass will come into play. There are over a hundred different stages from different franchises and along with it an amazing selection of soundtracks from different games and some tracks specifically for Smash Bros. There is also a full-fledged adventure mode known as The World of Light and includes Spirits, which are used to customize your favorite fighter so they can lay a bigger smackdown on your enemies. Plus, with the addition of stage switching, assist trophies, Pokeball items, final smashes, tournaments, and online play, yeah you have a lot to do in this game and a lot to look out for when you are smacking around someone playing Bowser using Pichu.

The Bad: If there is one bad thing I could say about this game, it would be that online can be a little laggy at times. However, it's not that big of a deal because it could be just my internet or the weight of everyone playing online trying to rack up dog tags and get to be crowned the best fighter in Smash Bros.

Final Thoughts: This game is worth your $60 dollars. With the large roster of characters, adventure mode, unlocking spirits, and online play, this game is a great addition to anyone's present list for the holidays and is great for anyone to pick up and hard to master. If you ever find me online in this game, let's make sure that fight will be a blast. Friend code for Switch: SW-4806-1035-6126",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

KhangMai,13-12-2018,"First of all, i don't like genre like fighting game where we have to fight each other. Second, type of fighting game always limit the floor. That is my opinion

- But these opinions are not for SSBU (also this is my first time playing this series). Sakurai did very good at this type of genre since this series start. not fighting till out of Hp, but fighting till hitting opponent out of the screen, which is very differently. Also adventure mode help player who does not use internet to play this game fighting against better CPU (when you want to get a 4 star spirit). Boss fight is my favorite of all. The reason why I enjoy playing this game is:
- Always have a chance to win opponent
- Lots of character with unique skills + our own character
- Easy to understand but hard to competently
- Different bosses make this game more unique and chance to control Master Hand
- Multiple player in a console
- Adventure mode
Negative: about assist trophy, this is what i hate the most, if they could only use skill rather join the battle.
I think this game deserve 9.5. I've spend 20 hours into this game. Anyway, it's way better than Pokemon Let's go.

This game is pure fun, in all of it's modes, including World of Light, Classic Mode, Online and Smash. The World of Light is a fun single player mode which also introduces spirits to this game.

There are 74 characters, and a bunch of which i hate being there! alot of great stages were cut over mediocre ones, such as the second pokemon stadium, or hanenbow! it's a great game, but the story mode gets so boring so fast, i only played it too unlock a couple of fighters and i gave up after i beat galeem and realized it basically sends you back to square 1! when pirahna plant beats out waluigi, you have to wonder, how the **** did sakurai actually say he thought waluigi was a joke character! plus, there are too many fire emblem characters! and rosalina and bowser jr are just unneccessary clutter on what could've been perfect! i love it, and i hate it, but in the end, sakurai did his best!",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The fighting mechanics feel fast and smooth and the graphics in my opinion have had a major upgrade.

TheCriticZombie,19-12-2018,"I love this game so much. It is one of my all time favorite switch games. The new characters are hype, and the old ones returning are pretty good too! The story mode, while not to the extent of brawl, certainly makes up for the fact that there was almost no single player in smash 4. Really well done, and with more stuff coming along, it's worth it to get a switch to get just this game (except for maybe the online but that's not a huge issue)",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

For those of you who are left, this game is loads of fun! I've been playing local multiplayer along with multi-console play, and the overall feel of every character and stage is great. I've also recently completed the Adventure mode, World of Light, which kept me entertained all the way though my playthough of about 16 hours. As of right now, I think this is by far the best smash game for casual users, and second best for competitive play behind Melee.

Maravilloso juego de peleas, destaca tanto en roster de Personajes, Escenarios, Musica, Modos de Juego (el cual posiblemente añadan mas con la version 3.0) y fluidez en los combates. Mucho contenido para un juego que pesa 13 GB

Algo que me hubiera gustado sobretodo en el modo historia serian las cinemáticas; están bien diseñadas pero no encuentro tanta interacción entre los personajes como en el modo historia del Brawl pero aun así esta bien.

CalebTV,21-12-2018,"I haven't been this hype for a game since while smash bros wii u. This game had an extraordinary amount of effort out into it. It has an amazing soundtrack full of nintendo songs, remixes, and great original tracks. There are tons of stages to battle on too. There are only 4 new ones though. I would have preferred if they cut down old stages for new ones. A new pokemon stage would have been great. The breath of the wild stage is very boring. I would have preferred divine beast vah medoh or hyrule castle. Plus they seem not to be paying attention to what fans want with stages. However that doesn't particulary matter to me as there are 103 so there are bound to be a few dozen you like. Sakurai also put tons of effort into the characters. They changed many of their appearances along with the stages. This looks very different from the wii u version. Although those graphics had a certain charm to it, I prefer the new ones since there are so many details. One of the best examples of the graphic change is princess zelda. She looks great and much more expressive. Plus she was buffed like many of the other characters. This made for great balancing. However once again I would have preferred quality over quantity. We didn't need clone characters, or echo fighters as sakurai tries to justify. I think pichu, wii fit trainer, young link, or so many fire emblem characters could have been cut. Dark samus could have easily been a costume instead of taking up a character slot. However Ken is a very good addtion. K rool, inkling, ridley, simon, and incineroar are also amazing. The game got rid of many mini games and instead went to the basics. Classic mode, world of light, and smash mode. All of these have many customization options. Classic mode is great and has unique bosses other than master hand. Clearly they put more effort than usual into that mode. The smash mode is very fun and has the best gameplay of any game (sorry melee fanboys). Online is very laggy however so I focused on single player. Local co-op was great but I didn't get a chance to play it very much. World of light has tons of effort but got boring and repetitive after a while. There are also spirits which improve your skills during gameplay and feature many characters that weren't included in the game. In conclusion, although it certainly has many flaws, it is a must play and is worth the price.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
glitchboi,23-12-2018,"Ah yes, Smash. The franchise of games that will make you lose friends.
This one, is my 2nd favorite smash game. My favorite is brawl.
Spirits mode is pretty fun, but it feels... kinda rushed. No cutscenes like brawl had. And brawl had a more detailed story tbh. Online is probably the only con I have here. Ever since brawl, there has been input lag. Sakurai, have you been noticing?
I like the addition of echo fighters, it makes clones not look like a useless fighter spot.
Everything else about this game is great.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
LemonChild,21-12-2018,"I dont own this game myself, but i have played this multiple times at a friends house. From what i have have played this is an extremely fun game! im a fan of the previous and i would say this is the best of the series so far. It combines the best elements from all the games! The fast pacing of melee, the starting og selection of the first smash and literally EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER. I would totally recommend this to anyone who's a fan of this fighting style of game.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
LavaNetworksYT,22-12-2018,"The game isn't perfect. No game is perfect. I've been a fan of the Super Smash Bros. series for a long time and forever I supported this game. World of Light is fun, I love that they brought back every past character as well as adding new ones and Classic Mode isn't just random match-ups with characters; a set path which links with the character in question, fitting bosses (although most of them is Master Hand but hey, I'm not one to complain) and hilarious/awesome/adorable pics at the end. Personally I wasn't satisfied with the Classic Mode in Brawl and Sm4sh (I haven't played 64 or Melee) but this one is amazing! The only thing that keeps this from a perfect score is the online mode. For Glory and For Fun worked. I would rather have them to expand on those 2 categories and adding preferred rules as a different option but I'm not a fan of how it is now. Thankfully it's better than what it was on release and I do like to do competitive battles on stages other than FD and Omega forms but the fact that there's no guarantee that you'll find someone that has similar preferred rules to your own bothers me as well as other people. I don't mind if it's 2 stocks instead of 3. I don't mind if there's suddenly a timer. I don't mind if the Final Smash meter is included. Because those are just small alterations that I can easily get by and still have a good match. But when it's a one stock match with items and my opponent waits for a Bomb-omb to drop and throw at me makes it only fun for one person. Unlike some other people, I'm grateful that this game exists. I'm grateful for all the work Sakurai and his team has put into this game. And sometimes I just wish that people can just accept the game for what it is. No whining that your favourite character isn't playable. No complaining that this game looks like a port of Smash for Wii U. No complaining that the story mode (BTW it's an ADVENTURE MODE! Might have a plot in it but Sakurai did say that it's more about fun than story and it's nothing like Subspace) isn't like a story in which it doesn't have much cutscenes. Sakurai didn't want to include an adventure mode but due to the overwhelming popular demand, he did it and the fact that the entire game was leaked 2 weeks early only proves Sakurai's reasoning for not wanting to include one.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

World Of Light is so much better than Subspace Emissary as you go straight into those spirit battles, I have had lots of fun playing this mode, 98% of the time. The other 2% is because of 'The Boss' and Pauline spirit battles. They were just extremely hard to beat. Overall, an awesome game for everyone.

Durpy,23-12-2018,"Super smash bros ultimate (which ill be referring to as SSBU) is a game that left me in ABSOLUTE AWE at the sheer amount of content with everyone from the series returning and several highly requested newcomers joining the battle, plus 6 more new fighters as DLC, a full-on 20-40 hour single player story mode, simple yet complex mechanics that makes it so that newbies can still have fun with the game, but also allows pros to play at a very high level of complexity, though i will criticize the AI for being a bit unforgiving to new players, and the online matchmaking needs to be tweaked a bit, but i personally only have problems with the AI more than online, because that problem can be caused from both the player (if they have a bad connection), and the devs, but i assume this issue will be shortly fixed (to an extent), seeing that the game hasn't been out for even a month and is already in ver. 1.2.1, my worries for these issues shouldn't really be taken seriously

overall, smash ultimate, although flawed in certain areas, can bring joy to anyone, from the people who just want to have fun, to the most high skill leveled pros who want to push this game to it's limits and i absolutely COMMEND samurai and his team for working their butts off just to make us happy, and i will DEFINITELY keep playing this game for YEARS to come, and see how sakurai, the community, and this game will grow, so, here's to 20 more years of smash, happy smashing",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

MaceoPrescesky,24-12-2018,"All right, the wait is over. And let me tell ya. This game is fantastic, a true must-play. So many characters, Either Newcomers, Veteran Fighters, or fighters that were absent from SM4SH/Brawl. There's new and hectic items, New cool features like underdog boost, FS meters, Stage morph, Shield parry, And having Stock-Stamina matches that make this game WAYYYY more than a port.
And if you wanna make smash a REAL party game with your friends, Just turn on Spirits! The Physics were reworked and the graphics are top notch! Classic mode is back in full force, too. Complete with a boss at the end. Most fighters have Master/Crazy hand as their boss. But sometimes, a very specific Kirby boss will show up. I wont spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but it is very surreal to fight him in a non-platformer gameplay style.
Then there's World of Light, The single player story mode. It's a neat distraction that can get you some spirits and kill a few hours of your like, but some of the battles are just straight-up unfair and the pacing is honestly really bad. It also would have been nice to have the option to play W.O.L
co-op. The only real negatives I have with the game is that there's not really anything to do outside of the main smash mode if you're playing with more than 2 people, and the online lags way more than it should. I'm paying for the online service now, it shouldn't lag this much. (Although maybe that's just my internet.)

PayTheRent,24-12-2018,"This game is wonderful. The combat is faster and loads of fun, the roster is the best that Nintendo has to offer, and this games visuals are beautiful. And with upcoming DLC, that will be a maximum 80 playable characters by the end of 2019, most of which are unique and worth a play. I loved Brawl, Melee, and Sm4sh, but Melee felt a bit too fast for its own good. This game has perfected the balance, making it slow and fun enough for casuals, and quick and engaging enough for competitive play. Solo play has so much to offer, the main attractions being Classic Mode and World of Light, the latter being large enough to be its own game. There are so many options now, especially involving rules and stages, which they have greatly improved. My only tiny issue is that WoL is a bit repetitive and more of something that you will chip at over a few weeks than spending one huge playing session on. But that’s mostly fine with me, as I love the Spirits system, and it doesn’t affect core multiplayer gameplay at all. I hear many complaints about the lack of in depth story and cutscenes for WoL, but that was because of the leaks and spoilers with all the cutscene for Subspace Emissary. And I think it’s quite redundant to talk about online by now, as we all know that’s not Nintendo’s strong suit. But all of that aside, this game has finetuned, perfected, and is the pinnacle of not only the Smash Bros. series, but fighting games as a whole. This is my favorite Switch game, and if it had not come out after Game Awards, this would deserve Game of the Year for sure.

(Also, I see many negative reviews in this section, and many of them have incorrect facts and/it biased opinions. Please check your facts before writing reviews, and try to keep as much bias as possibe out of them, too. Many of these reviews feel like these people didn’t even play the game, they just saw a few videos and wrote a paragraph.)",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The World of Light mode is fantastic with so much to do, I was honestly shocked at the fact that Galeem isn't the final boss, and that he is more of a mid-boss. They give you so much variety in the ways to unlock all 66 unlockable characters. There's Classic Mode which I love, especially with it drastically different difficulties, just playing the game in Smash, or even unlocking them all in World of Light mode. The one problem that I actually have with this game is it's online, which in theory would've been amazing, but in practice (thanks to the Switch's mainly peer to peer online service) it was laggy, especially if you're playing with people from long distances.

F1re,31-12-2018,"Pros:
Everyone and the stages from the previous games are back along with new characters and new stages
8 player smash is also back from the WII U version
Anyone can pickup the game, whether you've played the other games or are new to the series
There's a character for everyone (from Mario bros, to Zelda, to Pokemon, to Fire Emblem, to Metroid,to Castlevania, etc)
It's and HD game on a handheld, something of which the 3DS couldn't achieve
Really fun game to play with friends and even yourself
Cons:
The adventure mode is really repetitive and doesn't really feel like a story
Online is really, really, BAD
No stage builder (though some people might not care)
You have to repick the characters and rechange the skins of a character after a battle

Spartasclaws,30-12-2018,"Super Smash Bros Ultimate is truly the ultimate version of this franchise. Every character has returned making the roster round up to around 70 characters with 5 more to come in dlc. Every little thing has been tweaked and added such as directional dodges to land and parrying for a riskier option. You may only start with 8 characters however you get to unlock them 1 by 1 and whenever you face off against them and win it just feels satisfying after you beat them especially after beating the 1 character you have been eyeing. There has been a lot of people saying that ""the bots are to hard to fight"" or ""the AI is hacking"" but let me get something clear, this game is not broken. Everyone who's complaining about computers being broken just don't know how to play the game. The character unlocks are pretty generous, since when you lose to a fighter you can always re-challenge them later. This is because the more you unlock characters, the harder it gets to get more since they escalate quickly. However they have been made easier since before even the professionals like Leffen and Zero took some tries to win, but since then it has been so much easier to unlock things. Next off WoL the story mode. I won't be spoiling it but the mode is pretty repetitive I wouldn't recommend playing this for long periods of time and just chip at it from time to time. The difficulty can be some BS at time I will admit but if its to hard you can always change it, and if you still can't beat it then practice somewhere else until you can. To easy? Why not do what pro player Nairo is trying right now which is playing on hard mode without spirits. The online however kinda blows, as much as I have been praising this game the online really sucks. Lets say your trying out a new character online and you fight against this player who's around the same skill as you and you lose since you're playing a character you have never tried.So you go ""Hey this person's pretty good, I think I can beat him if I use my main."" So you try to use you're main....... But you can't. you aren't allowed to switch characters online. The preferred rules also don't help as much as it should. you end up getting rules who don't have the same map as you or items turned on which is completely unacceptable. But other then all that this game is a must whether you're a pro or just looking to have fun with you're family.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
RcGaming,30-12-2018,"I liked this game quite a lot. The basic game play was the best this series has ever had, even though it does have some weird mechanics. It's just so much fun to move around and attack. The character roster added back every older character from the series, and added a few new ones on top. All of the new characters are very unique and have distinctive styles. There were a lot of great stages, though there were only a few new ones, which was somewhat disappointing. I would have rather removed some of the older stages for more new ones but the stage selection is still very good. Spirits were a good change from equipment, as they are far more interesting. World of Light was fantastic. 30 hours of different battles with strange rule sets, and the mode is the best place to unlock more spirits. As for the games and more tab, while there aren't that many single player modes, with just classic mode and multi man smash, but classic mode and World of Light were so good that they alone make up for it. The vault is excellent, particularly for all the music that you can listen to whenever. And finally, a lot of people complain about the online. Firstly, the horrid matchmaking that the game released with was fixed in a recent patch, and now when I have preferred rules on, I almost always get my exact preferred rules. I know a lot of people have problems with online lag, but I've never had this issue so I can't confirm. The reason it doesn't hit a 10 is because as great as it is, it just isn't my favorite game. It's hard to say why, but I guess it just isn't quite my favorite game. Either way, when a game fails to hit a 10 for an entirely subjective reason, it is a good sign.

The character and stage selection is great, and some of the options are good to have. The story mode, while not as good as Brawl's, is still enjoyable for sure. The only things that prevent this game from being a 10/10 are the computer AI and the lack of things to do in single-player. They did nerf the AI to be less challenging which is good, but the game is missing a lot of single-player options. You have the standard classic mode, but what about Target Test, Home Run Contest, etc? All-Star Mode was also downgraded to Mob Smash, and speaking of, it no longer has 10-Man Smash, 3-Minute Smash, Rival Smash, or Endless Smash.

JustAnimator,30-12-2018,"The game is pretty fun, since my first smash was 3ds I’m used to the controls, fighters seem more powerful, and unlocking characters is fun! Though unlocking characters is hard, it’s quite rewarding! Plus there is another way to unlock fighters... world of light! World of light is a little repetitive but still fun! There are a lot of cool references with the spirits, like the cool earthbound spirits, and the way the fights are set up are straightforward! The amount of effort put into each fight and reference is amazing! Plus unlocking characters through world of light is easier! Sure is a love letter to fans, just like classic mode in this game! How mario fights mario villains, and how ryu and Ken fight street fighter characters! It’s just nonstop fun from every corner, the other modes like smash down and custom smash are fun! Though I am sad that the stage editor didn’t make it, other modes make up for the losses! Practice mode is quite good for making YouTube videos! Even though you can’t record videos without a capture card... speaking of downsides, let’s talk about online... it’s just really really laggy, I’m glad sakurai is looking into it now, it’s just too hard to deal with. Also I have a couple of gripes with arena mode, if you stay afk on the arena screen for too long it kicks you out of the ring! And if you lose even if you made the arena, you still get knocked out of the ring, and there’s no setting to change that! Plus somehow everyone is unbeatable! I’m probably bad at the game though... that means I always lose... but that lets me see how anime like getting launched off the stage is like! I love how cartoony the game has become, and the zooms are so cool! I can’t wait to play the dlc characters, and this time it seems like anyone can be dlc thanks to the surprise announcement of joker as dlc! I can’t wait to play the new stages and songs and fighters that come with the dlc pass! I love the game so far and I can’t wait to play piranha plant, also make sure to look up a tutorial on how to unlock him if you bought the game before February. One of the best super smash bros to come out!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
PerefL,30-12-2018,"I have been looking forward to this game for months, and it doesn't disappoint me. This entry appeals to both the casual and competitive spectrum of the players. The core gameplay is wonderful and feels so nice, the new characters added are either extremely unique or a new way to enjoy a previous character, and the ""Everyone is Here"" roster was a great decision. The AI in this game is more difficult and feels more human. Classic mode is a lot better than it previously was, and each character's route has its own unique theme. The side modes are more enjoyable than they were in Sm4sh, and the Adventure mode feels unique and is worth a playthrough. However, the Adventure mode can feel repetitive at times and difficulty spikes in it come out of nowhere partially thanks to the aforementioned harder AI. The characters are tedious to unlock, and if you're trying to, be prepared to play a lot of VS Matches, Classic runs, or World of Light. The worst part of the experience, though, is the online. Quickplay will often not give you your preferred rules or even similar rules. A recent patch has made this better, but doesn't fix the problem. Background Matchmaking doesn't fix the problem either. Battle Arenas are good with friends, but terrible publicly due to the fact that you can't have multiple battles at once or even spectate a match if you stop spectating or try to start in the middle. This is made even worse because you have to pay for a service which was once free. I hope these problems get patched and updated later on. Overall, though, the game is a blast. Everything it does well it nails, but the problems are keeping it away from a 10.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
AwakenedShrub,30-12-2018,"Love the Super Smash series in general and Ultimate did not disappoint. I have some problems with the game, but mainly only praise for it. I stayed up for hours the moment it came out and tried to get as many characters as I could before my energy ran out. The following day was so much fun. We had a party to celebrate the launch of the game and everyone was having a blast and enjoying the game. This is what Super Smash Bros has always been to me, and it's good to see that with the new game that hasn't changed. The speed of the games is pretty well managed and all the small UI changes look beautiful, along with of course the stellar visuals and new characters. Everything is polished and it all comes together with good game mechanics. Now for the few faults I have with it. And just a note - despite these faults I would still buy this game a hundred times over. Starting it off, the online mode is still a bit sketchy, preferred rules are only sometimes followed and connections can be shaky. This is the case only a quarter of the time, but I'd prefer to play a one-on-one when I choose those settings. Then there's the story mode. I thought it was great, hours of gameplay with a lot of weird but fun combos of characters and spirits. A few were challenging but most were just fun. However, I wish it could have been multiplayer like subspace was. I understand that with the way it was done, it would be much harder but I still would have liked some sort of co-op campaign. The other problem I have with world of light is that it isn't as much of a story mode as I hoped it would be. I don't want to compare it to subspace but that's the best example. Subspace was so good because of the amazing world that it built through small but powerful cut scenes that showed characters interacting with one another. I think that it could have benefited from more cut scenes. These few faults bring the score down just a bit, but overall if you want a good fighting game to play with your friends then Super Smash Bros Ultimate is for you.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
PhoenixJ33,30-12-2018,"The game is fun, it is my first ever Smash Bros. games. I like the classic mode because you can fight many different bosses. The World of Light has a interesting story to it. You can try to unlock a character again if you lose to it once about a few moments later. Also, you have all fighters from all the Smash Bros. games. The downside is that CPU is a little hard to beat and you have to pay for online now. I would rate this 9/10 or 10/10 if online was still free and the CPUs were easier to beat. So I rate this 8/10.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Owenmep,30-12-2018,"As someone who has never played a smash game, up until this game was teased... this game is complete garbage.

Just kidding it's the best smash game I've ever played. I've played hundreds of hours of brawl and Wii u, each his feels like you hit, like for example if you up B someone as Luigi your heart RACES as you see it zoom as the spike noise plays.

When I play this game it's as fun as any smash will get, 70+ characters, 103 stages, and a lot of content with classic mode and adventure mode.

This game is as hype as it will get, Joker as D:C, piranha plant, everything. Our daddy Sakurai poured his heart and soul into this game, literally, I was half expecting him to be a spirit.

BUT, with all of this said... Online is a MESS, battle arenas are... well, for some reason you can't change rules unless you DELETE it, and if you're hosting your stage seems to never get picked, that's not even mentioning the fact that game play sometimes turns from maximum smash mode to ""1 sec I need to load"". Meaning the game pauses for up to 10 seconds. Random matches are a mess, everything is a mess, it's preferred rules instead of just rules, and while I'm on the topic of online... you have to PAY for online, you have to pay for a peer to peer non dedicated server mess of a service with little to no redeeming features while Nintendo is all like ""HEY!! LOOK!!! OUR OLD GAMES!!!! YOU KNOW THE ONES YOU CAN EMULATE FOR FREE EASIER THEN PAYING US"" now it WOULD make sense if you were paying for dedicated servers for smash where you DON'T PAUSE every five seconds and STILL have input lag, but it's not like that.

As someone who doesn't play online other then with friends in an arena it doesn't bring down my score as much as expected, but still, if you're buying smash for a pure online experience... well... you might be REALLY mad when you realise you just shelled out 60 dollars to have to pay 20 more dollars for literally nothing.

When it comes down to it, Sakurai probably has no say in what online can be, other then preferred rules and the stupid arenas, but hey, it's not as bad as I was expecting.
This is a honest 9/10 for me, but if the online was fixed it would be 10/10.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Anti_badgame0,31-12-2018,"I've played Smash 4 as comparison for Ultimate and, i have to say, Ultimate is a VAST improvement over the last game. The presence of all the available previous Smash characters is awesome, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws.

WoL is a very fun, nostalgic and entertaining experience, but more than often certain fights were very gimmicky and even somewhat unfair. They're possible, but annoying and ruins the enjoyment of players.

Classic Mode's gold earnings need to be improved compared to Smash 4's potentially thousands worth in Classic Mode, but it's been vastly improved in its own way (Not a boring bard game and instead a proper route)

Finally, the gameplay is much more invigorating than Smash 4's slower pace. Ultimate is unforgiving, with its intense pace and powerful attacks. The teching system is an awesome trump card for a powerful hit and the adjustments to air dodging makes aerial play actually viable since all characters only have one.

To finish, this game is jammed full of content, absolutely full of it, it took 20 hours to 100% WoL on Normal difficulty personally and Classic Mode for all 74 characters would take hours, along with the promise of more DLC characters like Piranha Plant and Joker being icing on the cake. Smash Ultimate is a game that keeps on giving and an absolute must-have for the Switch. It isn't without its flaws, giving it the 9/10 rating",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Justanepicgamer,03-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is arguably the best smash game of all time. Like, literally, it has everything good about previous smash bros games and mixes it to be the ultimate smash bros game.

Every character which has ever joined Super Smash Bros is back! The amount of fighters is overwhelming at the least. Like, how can you complain about this roster. Is perfect. And with the inclusion of echo fighters, it open the door for characters that we thought they will never get in. Like Daisy, Dark Samus or even Ritcher. The stage amount is soooooo perfect. 103 stages without counting battlefield and omega forms? Please Sakurai, take a 3 year vacation after the completion of the DLC. The gameplay however... I mean, it's objectively the best, like, I love how it's very well balanced or how literally every character is viable on competitive scene. But I just don't like it as much as smash 4's... i don't like how the shield can feel pretty cheap at some points, like, when an opponent does a poorly calculated smash attack, there isn't enough time for you to punish that because 1.) They have already shielded or 2.) They have already shield-rolled. But besides that, I find the gameplay to be very solid and really fun to play casually or competively. Also it looks like it's going to be the most balanced smash game due to patch notes, so yea,

World of Light is great, I love it, I love how it's very relaxing to play, the amount of references on the **** themselfs, great bosses... It's complex but at the same time it's very simple. There ae over 1300 spirits and with more incoming due to events.

The online... works? I find it very dissapointing, especially quickplay, but battle arenas are rad though. Sometimes you won't get the matches you want in quickplay, and it can be very frustrating. The lag is also a thing and it's even laggier if you're playing with your friends of other continents. It's ok, but it can be improved heavily.

Classic mode is really great, that's it. everything in games and more is really solid, but I miss some modes like home run contest or events... oh well, hopefully they'll add those modes in future updates. Amiibos also work in this game which is a relief. And challenges are back whoch is awesomeeee.

And the soundtrack. oh my... There are roughly 900 tracks in this game. It's literally he best videogame soundtrack of all time, just because like Sakurai said, ""It's like you have a videogame music collection"". You can even create your own playlists to listen to your favorite music whenever you want to.

So yea, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a must-buy of every Switch owner. Like I said at the beginning of the review, it's the best Smash bros. game to date. It's worth the money.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
HidBid,31-12-2018,"This game is AMAZING. First of all, the new Challenger's Approach system makes it a lot easier to unlock characters. Spirits is long and very enjoyable. The online system lags, but they have done a great job on balancing it. None of the mechanics are annoying or game-breaking, and so are the characters. Classic mode has many great references and is personalized for every character such as Kirby's final boss being Marx, Mr. Game & Watch battling many old-school characters, etc. There are so many great new characters, including King K. Rool, Inkling, Isabelle, etc. Overall this game is PERFECT, with every feature being MAGNIFICENT. This is one of the best games for 2018.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

This game is the best game I’ve played in 2018, this also happens to be my favorite fighting game of all time, I must say that my online experience is a tiny bit broken.

World of light is an amazing story mode with great references hidden at every corner. However, some world of light fights are ridiculously hard. Like the bayonets fight to at the race track. Also, a lot of amazing modes were left out. My biggest complaint is the echo fighters. Some characters like toon link and dr.mario, who are obviously echo fighters are listed as separate fighters. Overall this game is amazing but has some problems with it.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
epicgamer999,01-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is definitely the best SSB game so far. It has an absolutely massive roster of 74 characters, which doesn’t count Bowser Jr.’s echo fighters hidden as color variants. Instead of giving you all the fighters at the start, it makes you unlock them by beating them, which is definitely more fun. There are plenty of items, from the brand new Mr. Saturn to the tried and true Hammer. Sakurai added a new feature called spirits, lesser characters from Nintendo games that add little advantages to your game, which you win by playing insane challenges. The spirits are kind of like trading cards, and I’m addicted to winning them in the challenges. No matter what anyone says, King Dedede is the best fighter. I was a bit disappointed to find out Waluigi wasn’t joining the battle, but at least he’s an assist.

DuckTurtle,02-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is an extremely fun fighting on the Nintendo Switch. The Game has over 70 character (with 6 more being added as DLC) who all have different attacks, this make the game play fun and unique every time you change your character. World of Light is a fun campaign where you save a lot of video game characters, with unique references to their original game. The Spirit Board is fun and challenging. Classic mode a fun and short campaign which has a lot of references to their original game (for example Mario fights against other iconic Nintendo characters. On the second to last battle you fight against Bowser Jr. and the Koopalings, and on the final battle you fight Bowser and Giga-Bowser.). While the online isn't as good as I hoped, it still works most of the time. I rarely see lag, and usually get my rule set or something close to mine. The online is decent in my opinion and can be better. The characters are really balance, with none of them being extremely strong or weak. The soundtrack in this game is HUGE with roughly 900 songs. Everything in this game is really good. This is a must have for the Nintendo Switch. Without a doubt my favorite game of 2018. 10/10",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

SpookBones,02-01-2019,"SSMBU is a great game for almost anyone. Whether or not you’re a 30 year old who played Super Mario Bros 3 when you were 8, a millennial who played Sonic the Hedgehog 2 when you were 10, or a teen like me who had a Wii U in 2015 and played Splatoon, or a number of other games. It is not without flaws, however.

Positive

-The Smash mode is a huge improvement over the Wii U game from 2014 because you have to unlock most of the characters, which makes it so the game doesn’t quickly get old if you don’t have the online mode, like me. Instead of just being able to choose Bowser Jr. right from the start and not giving any of the other characters a chance, you actually have to learn how most of the characters work to determine who your main is. By the time you have 40 characters unlocked, you can play at least 10 of them well.
-The amiibo system is good, and while it is similar to SSB4, if you used any amiibo in 4 it keeps their data. You can also erase the data and start over. And if you don’t want to use amiibo, you don’t have to. It’s completely optional.
-The actual gameplay is great, even simple attacks like grabs feel meaty and powerful. The sound effects really help this as well the other effects like impact “lights” when you land a hit. There’s so many effects that the photo mode lets you turn them off when you take a picture. Speaking of which...
-The photo mode, while not as good as Spider-Man’s or Super Mario Odyssey, still has many options and a frame-by-frame feature which can let you take pics at just the right moment. My photo library is now full of silly pictures.
-The menus are simple and easy to understand.
-Trophies are removed and are replaced with spirits, which are actually useful. I’m not going to to into detail on the spirits, because the direct explains it well enough.
-A lot of the characters movesets are very inspired. For example, Mario uses his cape from Super Mario World, FLUDD from sunshine, Fire-flower Fireballs, and jumps into people for coins as his specials. Even characters that aren’t as inspired, like Sonic, still pay homage to games like Adventure.
-A number of other great things that aren’t as major. Play the game, and you’ll notice tons of cute little details.

Negative

-Spirits Mode Adventure kind of sucks. It’s very repetitive and I didn’t bother going further than unlocking Sheik, which is the second person you save. Many of the fights are just stupidly difficult. If all you want to do is unlock spirits and nothing else, use the spirit board or scan non-fighter amiibo instead.
-The CPUs are sometimes ridiculously difficult. In a lot of my attempts to unlock characters, I got launched in the air, tried to land, got launched again, repeat 8 times until I die. This probably isn’t an issue for seasoned Smash veterans however.

Nitpicky Subjective Stuff

This is simply subjective things that don’t bring down the overall score. If you agree with one of these though, you may think lower of the game.

-I believe that a few fighters could have more characters from their series as fighters. For example, Sonic is the only fighter from the titular series. If Knuckles and/or Shadow were also playable there would be more representation for his fans, which I am one of. If Mario and Fire Emblem get so many characters there should be a few more for other fellows.
-Too many anime characters that almost nobody asked for.
-Stage Builder would be nice.

Overall this game is one of the Many Must Plays For The Switch. If you like nearly any Nintendo franchise you should get this game. If you like fighting games you should get this game. If you like good video game, GET THIS GAME!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
dannick84,02-01-2019,"Alright look, you don't need me to tell you this game is awesome. There is something in this game for anyone to enjoy, spirit mode, classic mode, the main smash mode, online, you name it this game has it. But of course, no game is perfect, there are just a few nitpicks that makes me grind my teeth at the thought of why it's there.

For one, online, I understand most of what they did was to create a better environment seeing how toxic For Glory was, but I think including a ranked mode where everyone just plays in a 1v1 format would have been much better. This is because GSP feels as if it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things, because why is someone who has only played in 2v2 team battles and items on being compared to someone who's only played in 1v1's with items off. Lag will always be annoying in online and is what really kills it from all the potential it has. Just the fact you now have to pay for online, for Nintendo doing essentially nothing but putting a paywall is just daunting to me.

Next, the real meat of the game, smash mode(not sure what else to call it) it's the same frantic fun as before, the way you pick how you want to play has changed. Now, instead of going straight into the character select screen and picking your rules then the stage, you're forced to pick your rules, then your stage and finally your character, it's odd at first, but I don't mind. Their is just so much possibility with 69 character at the moment and 74 soon to be added. Gameplay has been slightly altered. A few tweaks that I've noticed myself was: you could no longer dash behind your opponent, heavy weights now feel like they survive much longer than before and spiking them no longer feels like a free stock, light weights seem faster, but now die much more quickly. This is just my opinion, but airdodge seems to be worse, I find that occasionally I will directional airdodge and fall to my death as I'm unable to move in the air. While the whole point was just a slight movement option so you could get back on to stage I no longer airdodge as much as I used to.

Spirit mode is something I still have yet to finish, so I feel it would be unfair for me to dive too deep into it. From what I've played it's a really easy way to unlock characters and the spirit battles while challenging I don't find myself coming back to, simply because they weren't that fun for me. I know that others may enjoy this mode, but the battles are tedious for me and I'd rather play the real bread and butter of this game.

Finally classic mode, this mode has definitely gone through a multitude of changes. No longer can you just start at the highest intensity, but you start at 5.0 and raise up from there. Honestly I don't like it that much, how you raise up is dependant on how quickly you completed the battle, however most of these battles don't end so fast and I feel more pressured to end the battle quickly then take my time and achieve victory. What I do love though is it feels as if every character has their own story to go through in classic mode, and you will understand why you must fight a certain character if you've played their game, just adding more charm to this game. The battle with master hand and crazy hand has also been revamped, both now have a health bar and if one falls too low they become stunned, allowing you to rack up damage on the other hand or try and go for the kill on the stunned one.

So, like I said before, you don't need me to tell you this is truly the ultimate smash bros. game. I adore that Sakurai and the team at Nintendo gave all of their players so many options for how they want to play for both the casual and competitive scene. This is the best smash bros game and will certainly stay that way for a long time.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Rayrabid,20-03-2019,Super smash bros ultimate is a fairly good game best smash not in my opinion but its still great regular smash mode has more features then ever theres tournament mode were you have friends or ai fight in a tournament to see who is the most skilled special smash is regular smash but with a tweak what is it? You will have to find out yourself there is a mode called classic were you pick a fighter and go threw challanges to fight a boss oh! I forgot to mention the huge roster smash bros ultimate has! EVERY single fighter from EVERY single smash game is here is there a fighter you loved from a previous game and got removed from later entrys? BADA BOOM BADA BANG your fighter is back in the game! (That ryhmes) and they didint just bring old fighters and put them back in the game they added new ones! You can also create your own fighter called a mii fighter part of the nintendo switch settings is an option to create a mii which originated from a previous console the wii! If you have a figure called an amiibo you can put them in the game and train them! Now on to the story mode in this mode you go threw battles with fun challenges you will face! Personally i prefere brawls story mode because it was more of an adventure then same old battles which is also why i prefere brawls story mode (and the game in general) over ultimate! But i know brawl wont be everybodys jam ultimate is more open to new players. But my golly! the soundtrack is fantastic there is even an option in the game to listen to music! THhere are over 800 tracks! You can also make replay videos as well were you can relive fun moments you had in the game previously! Now we are down to the final game mode online its basically regular smash accept with people from all over the world! But if your friend is at his house and wants to play you can make an arena just for you and your friend! we still have more content coming to the game there will be five paid dlc fighters coming to the game with a new stage each and music from there games! Expanding the already humongus soundtrack! But if you want these fighters you will have to pay 25$ but wait! Lets say you only want one fighter it only cost 5$ so its a deal you should try and snag! I hope you consider playing this game because if you own a nintendo switch console this is a must play,8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
ThisBoiLoveAmmy,03-01-2019,"Can i say how good this game is? Yes? Ok thanks. Almost everything about this is crazy and amazing. Most characters were either buffed (like pichu) and nerfed really hard (like bayo) which makes the game more balanced, fair, and playable. The graphics are out of this world with every character looking different from their previous games and the newcomers having unique looks. The gameplay is the main thing of smash and oh boy did Sakurai make it worth it. The gameplay is not as fast as melee and not as slow as brawl. Its the perfect mix for new players or smash vetarens. Then there is world of light, which is good, but a little broken. A problem i have with world of light is the unfairness that either you do to the opponent and what the opponent does to you. But thinking on the bright side, i saw you can play AS MASTER HAND. No way did Sakurai think he would get this far. And finally, online. What i see people disscus about Super Smash Bros Ultimate's online is poorly developed and really bad because you have to pay to play online. But for me its just fine. It does lack a bit of things (like why cant you play arena mode only with friends and not online) but online is a good one (btw they removed conquest) :( ).

TBBEX,07-01-2019,"I bought this game on launch day and to make sure I took in all Ultimate could offer, I waited a month to review it. So, here is my review.

This is my second Smash game (First being Smash Wii U) and I was stunned. When Sakurai called this game the ""biggest crossover in gaming history"", he was not wrong. With 74 base fighters and six DLC fighters (counting Piranha Plant) coming out, 1297 spirits, 103 base stages and five DLC stages coming out, nearly 900 music tracks and some DLC music tracks also coming out, this game is truly massive. I 100% completed the World of Light story and unlocked EVERY spirit and I was stunned on how much better the spirits were than trophies compared the other Smash games.

I played the online mode of Smash Ultimate (of course) and found myself unlocking Elite Smash for Isabelle and Little Mac but that does not correct the problem with the online mode, lag. The constant lag (even using a wired Ethernet connection) was horrendous and annoying. Every other round I played, I would face lag and often get really annoyed.

Every weekend, there is a Spirit Board Event, in which there is a theme for the Spirit Board and honestly, I love it. My favorite being the most recent, the Retro Classics.

Overall, I really loved this installment of Smash Bros and hope the future games are just as good",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
SunshineFan,04-01-2019,"One of the best games for the Switch, and one of the best games in the franchise. The part of unlocking characters in both the normal game and Adventure mode allows players to use characters they might seem skeptical about. Many characters were greatly improved from other smash games, like Pichu and Ganondorf. The vast amounts of stages to pick, even if some are not really good (i.e. 75m and Hannenbow). The adventure mode is kind of like a ""choose your own adventure"", as there are multiple paths to defeat Galeem, and later Darkhon and the Final Battle. And the endings of Adventure mode, too. When I defeated only Galeem, Darkhon takes over, and you see Mario on his knees, like we lost all of hope. It was very moving. The spirit mechanic is very good, and the CPUs in adventure mode are only difficult depending on the rank of the spirit. I also gotten good, because of this. I'm more conformable taking on Lv. 5 CPUs in Solo Smash. Also, it is so good to see every fighter in smash history to come back, even Pichu. The final smashes are very capable to show what powerful beings they can be, even Isabelle gives me shakes when fighting her. Also, the sheer amounts of music packed into this thing, and I thought Kirby Star Allies had a lot. However, most great games have flaws. The main theme of Smash is kind of overplayed, and I kind of got sick of it. The online is kind of laggy, worse than Mario Tennis Aces. There is only one bonus mode, and I do like the concept, but it is boring. And yes, I know people are complaining Waluigi is not a fighter, but maybe Nintendo doesn't really know his moveset, as he is mostly a spin-off character. Also, Geno is only in one game, but at least he is a Legendary ranked spirit. At least they are spirits or assist trophies, so they are in the game. Overall, this game is definitely a must by for your switch. Also, for those who gave a zero on this game, you are not playing the game. It is supposed to be a fun time. Also, it is nice that some characters are echo fighters, but they may have different stats. and did I mention you can boost and weaken your character roster? For those who aren't good at the game, give it a try!",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
MCSorcerer,04-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros Brawl was the first video game I ever played, and although I did not get to see the community and the franchise grow from the beginning, I grew up with this series, and I have grown to love the hard work the developers put into the game. I know this may sound biases, which it probably is, but that is why professional critics exist. I want to speak my opinion, no matter the lack of objectivity. I have played every Smash game at least once, but I do not have a lot of time in the 64 version, Melee, or the online experience. However, i have gone quite far into the single player experiences from Brawl to Ultimate.
The Characters:
With 74 fighters, it can be hard to pick just one. I know that many people complain that you start with 8 fighters and have to unlock the other 63 fighters (not counting Mii fighters). Although many favorite characters were picked as an Assist Trophy or a spirit, Nintendo was able to add Castlevania and, soon, Persona, to their host of third party series taking their part of that Smash Bros pie. Whoever thought that someone would be able to play as Mario against Mr. Game & Watch, Ice Climbers, R.O.B., Simon Belmont, Joker, Ridley, and Bayonetta back before Brawl? Infinity War being the greatest crossover of all history? Yeah, right. All of these characters, along with over 28 hours of music tracks including remixes and original pieces and over 100 stages make an overwhelming game seeming with new and remastered content.
Game Modes:
Although everyone knows the normal Smash mode, they added a lot of changes to the formula including a smash meter, spirit teams, tourney, and, of course, many new items. You also have Classic, Century Smash, Spirits, a new reformed training mode, and more. The training mode, by the way, really shows that Nintendo is moving away from the casual ideas of what Smash should be. They are accepting the competitive nature of the game, by adding all of the eSport friendly changes to training.
The World of Light:
Although I really love WoL, I prefer the Subspace Emissary. While the WoL explores a more creative way of telling a story while staying true to the gameplay, the Subspace Emissary fleshes out the characters and put them in small teams while they slowly start to culminate into the entire roster. The hidden characters, Toon Link, Jigglypuff, and Wolf, was a reason to replay the game. Besides that, however, the rest of the SE was quite dry, and it was notably repetitive. WoL, on the other hand, has certain objectives you must complete. Every fight is different, and while it is just custom smash, certain matches are quite difficult, and it requires you to find a way to work around it by finding other spirits first that work exceptionally well. Not to mention, the bosses are amazing. They represent the series they are from. They each have attacks from their own games, and it makes each one interesting in its own right. While I wish there were more SE bosses, it's better to have new ones than to reuse the same old ones.
Spirits:
The spirits is very similar to the stickers from Brawl. At the moment, there are 1302 different spirits, 2 of which are exclusive to those who buy Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu or Let's Go Eevee, the partner pokemon from the respective game. These spirits have different qualities and effects that work in certain situations better than others. The rock, paper, scissors mechanic is simple, yet interesting. You can also trade spirits to obtain other spirits. Not to mention, when certain spirits reach level 99, they can evolve like Pokemon, and, ironically, there are not many Pokemon that have this trait. Which makes me disappointed when I get some Pokemon compatible with mega evolution only for it to be just stuck as it is. All of this in mind, it reminds me to one of those phone games that let you raise, evolve, and breed beasts like dragons. The spirit board is an interesting idea and is a good way to collect all of the spirits fast. Currently, I have less then 100 spirits left, half of which is from WoL with over 600 unique spirits in it alone. Overall, this mode and countless hours in it alone.
Conclusion:
Overall, this game is, well, ultimate. The fighters, the stages, the music, the spirits, the game modes, the love and effort the developers put into the game. I hate it when people say that this game is just a port, because if you make something new from treasured, old pieces, and from imaginative new pieces, of course it is going to seem like a port. There is a lot of content from the last game because this game is ULTIMATE. It is the actual embodiment of the culmination of all the other installments in the franchise. It is the epitome of the best parts of the old and the new. This game deserves its title, and I am more then over joyed with the quality and overall beauty of this game.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Ytaaps,09-01-2019,"Like its predecessors smash its one amazing game recommended for everyone who is looking for a great time.

I loved the huge character selection and the fact that they are bringing back old characters like pichu, snake, ice climbers and such. A downside i see from the character selection is the amount of echo characters like, richter, daisy, dark samus, ken and chrom, some of this are understandable but in my opinion some like daisy are pointless, perhaps instead of those echo some of the fans favourites could have been added.

""Skinds or colour selection"" of the character i think in some characters are lacking originality or relevance, taking bowser as one example, with the ""new"" mario odissey a nice outfit would have been wedding bowser like mario or even skeleton bowser, it would be more appealing to see new colours for some characters.

Stage select before the characters its still a downside for me, i still cant get used to it and it feels weird, i understand the reason of this change but in my opinion its not atractive.

i love the way that now you can set combat preferences and quicksave them for future fights, its very useful!

Spirits are great, i loved the way you use them to change the way of the battles.

While adventure mode was fun i think they could have dome a little bit more, subspace had a lot of cinematics and a decent story while world of light lacks in thats, it makes up for the fight but it can quickly get tedious.

Online mode you will love it or hate it, some times the lagg is unbearable.

Over all i think its a must have game, somethings could have been added and some could have been skipped but we got more than we expected and looking fordward for the new characters!",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

ExeExoticz,09-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. is back with it's newest game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, this game has every character from every Smash Bros. game ever however, not everything is here. This game removes some previous mechanics from previous installments like the ""Smash Tour"" in Smash Bros. for the Wii. U but also introduces so many new mechanics and new characters. Also, this game contains an ""Adventure Mode"" titled ""World of Light"" and it is LONG containing a minimum of about 6-10 hours of playtime to finish it and a long time getting every character and spirit in ""World of Light."" Again, Sakurai put his soul into this game and made sure that everything was the best it can be however, not everything is actually perfect. The online mode had very negative responses when the game was first out and it still isn't perfect. For example; if you were to enter into preferred rules maybe 3 Stock, no items, and 1 on 1 it might put you into a free for all and even though this is understandable, it happened too often when the game was first released and still happens on a rare occasion, but that is only one minor flaw that is being improved.

Schwambosii,09-01-2019,"Perhaps the most anticipated game for the Switch, Super Smash Bros Ultimate is so bittersweet. The game play has seen some modest tweaks to improve on a near flawless mechanic. The character and stage selection is equally impressive. This is undoubtedly the best entry to date for a series that has been nothing short of amazing. Unfortunately, the game's online features leave so much to be desired and would be deemed unacceptable for any other developer. Save for some minor improvements from an early patch, the game suffers from frequent lag due to P2P connection. Having Nintendo Online friends is pointless, more or less. There is no option to view online friends or invite them to play. There are only two matchmaking options: quickplay (where you are randomly paired with opponents and pray that the match adheres to your preferred rules) or battle arenas (where you either join premade arenas of rotating players or create one yourself and pray for people to join). The worst part of it all is that this game could easily be a 10. This is an amazing multiplayer game that doesn't want you to play with friends. Sakurai and Nintendo have been criticized in the past for their lack of support for the competitive Smash community, saying that the game should be enjoyed by everyone. The irony is that they've made it near impossible for players to enjoy the game with their friends that aren't sitting on the couch next to them. Oh, and I nearly forgot, they dare to charge you for their joke of an online system.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Pros:

- A beautiful game with beautiful stages

Cons:
- Story mode not as interesting as Brawl
- Missing some extras from Brawl which were fun

Overall the game I believe is without a doubt the best in the series. It feels great to play and at the end of the day, it's incredibly fun. It's the kind of game you'll never sell or get bored with. Well done Sakurai",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Aphros22,10-01-2019,"I love this game, but there are a few flaws. Some characters are pretty unbalanced with the 70+ roster. I'm also not a fan of how they removed trophies and introduced spirits. I understand why sakurai did it but it was so cool to see all the models of the characters in the game and reading their descriptions, when i was younger i would spend hours just looking at them. But now they've been replaced by jpegs.
My last complaint is i'm not all that good at the game, and the online matchmaking pairs me up with people who kick my a** every time. There is also a fair bit of input lag online.

Esspresso,10-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is the sixth game of the series and I somewhat still prefer the 64 and Wii U game. Time to put everything I really don't like about Ultimate :

- Biggest input lag of the series
- The buffer system (this is an horrible concept in a fast paced platform fighting game))
- Too many Out Of Shield options. Shielding is nearly unpunishable since a simple jump/grab can cancel all the animation from deactivating it.
- Shields are taking ages to be broken. 2 smash attacks with Captain Falcon and a shield is still active ?
- Too many ""stun states"" (being buried for example, too many characters have the possibility to stop you)
- Super armor. I hate that thing. Half of K. Rool's moveset got it, the down special of Ryu/Ken too. Really fun to play against.
- The online is a joke, having preferred rules won't matter since they'll be chosen once in a blue moon.
- You die at so low percents, even without rage on, it's horrible. Pick K. Rooland do the following : Grab > Down Throw > Down smash at the edge and get your free kill

. Everything listed here is, in my opinion really annoying. Ultimate isn't the ""oh so melee hd"", it is slow, makes you more slow if you are aggressive and encourages to play so campy it is just annoying.
Ultimate is fun if you're trying to party with friends (that don't know that some oves can instakill), that's it.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Batesiebum,16-01-2019,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is likely the best smash bros. to date. Controls are fluent and easy yet hard to master, and playing against other people will force you to do more than just mash combos. You will be forced to play and predict your opponents moves, and trends then try and adjust for an advantage. The online multiplayer plays well enough, although there was slight input lag that occurred in some matches (may have been from my own connection but I do not know for sure). The large cast of characters is great and interesting, alhough I wish that there were not any clones of other characters (i.e. Samus and Dark Samus, Pit and Dark Pit), but it does not really take away from the actual game because of how many characters there actually are. I enjoyed the world of light as a challenging experience, although some have claimed it to be too difficult I found it to be perfect for me on Hard difficulty to do more than just jump in and win every level (using the good ol' ""get good"" defence here). Other modes are also fun like the classic mode that takes you back to the original single player mode that gives you a streamline of levels that eventually lead to masterhand, but i have not delved into all of the extra modes so i cannot speak on everything. So far Super Smash Bros. Ultimate seems to be exactly what you would expect to get out of a Smash Bros. game but with more content, characters, and more refined gameplay. The game is well worth the price, but character clones, input lag, and a slightly underwhelming world of light makes me want to say it is somewhere around a 8.5-9/10.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I may not have gotten my requested character (Geno4Life) but I'm nonetheless satisfied with the newcomers that the fan base had been asking for for years!

GlacierPlayZ,26-01-2019,"With the little time I have played SSBU, I have enjoyed it to the fullest. Each match I play with the owner of the switch I somehow beat them time and time again. Apart from my personal experience, SSBU has to be one of the most polished games in the franchise. Nintendo has really learned from their mistakes from their last games. The combat is the highlight light of the game. It's flashy in all the right ways, your hits have a satisfying thump and weight to them. Each character responds the way you think they are going to, most of the time. Spamming and camping seem to have declined more than the last games. The music has almost the same feeling as the main theme for Halo one when they hit you with LifeLight. They remix the song in the right ways to fit the mood of the fight. When you are almost dead, it steadily gets more and more tense as the game progresses. I would disagree with the people who think they are higher than this game. Most make claims that ""SSBU doesn't help captivate new players into the franchise."" To which I reply, ""HELL NO."" I was instantly excited and thrilled to play the game for the first time. It almost sucked me in, to say the least. Those people are either extremely arrogant, or terrible at the game and blame it for their lack of skill. I do agree that the combat can be extra spammy when it comes to pro players (take for instance Zer0 with Cloud). All the characters are viable against another. Most are balanced, others are nerfed to the ground. Some are extremely overpowered, most of the Anime characters, Mii Fighter, Meta Knight.
To wrap this whole affair up is, SSBU proves that a game doesn't have to be fresh, too competitive, or too casual to be a game that is fun, enjoyable, and stressful all in the right ways.

The ""story mode"" is big enough to invest many hours into however the story mode (World of light) is no successor to Subspace emissary from Brawl as far as cutscenes/story theres up to about 14mins of cutscene and no ingame story to be found, the content within WOL can be enjoyable in places but it becomes horrible repetitive after the first hour or two in which it becomes a terrible long grind to get to the end. Super Smash Bros ultimate unlike other games in the series has collectables called ""spirits"" which tie into the story and to replace the other smash games collectables the ""trophies"", the spirits are one of the few things added to the series which i can praise as they find way more use then the trophies in the other series games as they have uses in both single player and mulitplayer game modes. In terms of the amount of content in Super Smash Bros Ultimate there is certainly alot however there is just not alot of variety in this game unlike the other games in the series as they have removed quite alot of game types that have been in the series for awhile for example ""Home Run contest"" and ""break the targets"" are absent with this being the case there is just no variety in this game as there are a handful of single player modes and online mutiplayer. Super Smash bros ultimate is the 3rd game to have a online multiplayer and overall its made some progress and alot of regression, firstly the connection seems to have improved since Super Smash Bros Wii U however this is only in the case of the games being just 2 player as the connection is noticeble poorer with 3 or more people present. For the first time in the Super Smash Bros series you have to pay for a Nintendo Online subscription to be able to play online with friends and people around the Globe, so does the online service provided worth paying for ?. Simply No it doesnt firstly because of the connection being at a poor quality which in the year 2019 and Nintendo being the provider it can definatly be a whole lot better, Secondaly the online does not keep its matchmaking to player who have the same set rules as you which again for a game in 2019 is some poor desicion making especially when they had a bases for dividing people who wanted to play casual and people who wanted to play competative in their last Smash game ""super smash Bros Wii u"".

NowiGreen,27-01-2019,"While looking at this game as just smash this game delivers in spades and has by far the best smash game given its roster and rebalancing of characters, however, the world of light is far worse than the world of trophies aka the Subspace Emissary, not only does difficulty spike at random intervals but so many of the ""challenges"" boil down to situations that no casual or competitive player will ever be in.
This results in tedious grinding for spirits and skills just to fix what shouldn't have been made broken in the first place. These aren't fun these are masochistic.
Unlike the Subspace, there is no real story and every fight is set on a stage chosen in regular smashes and without the well-detailed art of the trophies that are now gone this games bonus content really lets it down.
A well made game with a poorly tacked on story that holds it back.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

There is even more stuff coming with updates like Nintendo does with every switch game in 2018. However the game does has some problems with a story mode that takes forever to finish, a laggy online service that likes to crash just about as you’re going to win, and some of the not very fun or boring stages to play on like upl, gco instead of good stages like pokefloats or woolly world. Even a lot of character moves do way to much damage or have broken effects. However they likely will patch those problems.

Fransu_YT,30-06-2019,"I don't think I'll be angering many people when I say that this is one of - if not THE - best fighting games ever made and probably the best Smash game ever made, too. I am a bit biased towards the series (after all it's one of my favorites) but I think it's pretty objectively true that this game is worth the price tag - and maybe even the DLC if you're really into it like I am! - if you're purely thinking about how much time you'll be putting into it. At the time of writing this review, I'm nearing about 500 hours of playtime on my Switch, and it has barely become boring. It's one of the most enjoyable couch versus games, and it even has a few co-op modes and a great Spirits mode to keep you entertained during long trips! With the recently added Stage Builder and Shared Content modes, you can even create your own stages and download them and much more that other people made through the Internet!
This game really does nearly everything. There isn't really a reason not to buy the game, except if you really, really don't like platformer fighting games. The other reason that you wouldn't have it is that you don't have a Switch, and if you don't have a Switch, what are you even doing, sitting on your computer and reading this review?

The best Smash Brothers game by far and world of light is amazing. I just recently picked this game up less than a week ago and I’ve already put in over 20 hours to world of light alone. The only thing is that while in handheld mode with a lot of players it gets very hard to see",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
ReviewerT,15-03-2019,"I personally want to give this a negative score based on how bad my experiences with the game competitively have been, but I know that isn't fair so I'm going a bit higher. I'm going to get into the pros before I get into what drives me crazy about this game (By the way this is pretty biased, but so is basically every review so hate all you want. I don't care lol).

The game is very well balanced, most definitely the most balanced smash game so far including Smash 4. The game will be receiving patches at a good rate so I can't see a Melee Fox or a Brawl Meta Knight tier character rising to the top unless a mistake happens, which would probably be fixed later on. Additionally, the roster is HUGE. Newcomers like King K. Rool, Inkling, Ridley, and Simon Belmont were definitely good calls by Nintendo. And the idea of ""Everyone is Here!"" means almost nobody's past main is left behind and I love it! The soundtrack is nice, the graphics are beautiful and are probably the best in the series, and finally, the amount of content presented within the game is nothing to scoff at.

Ultimate is a good game objectively. But if I'm being honest, Ultimate has a ton of things that hold it back from being the best smash game in my book. For one, some of the mechanics and how the game flows either don't mix well together or simply aren't good. For example, the majority of moves are safe on shield and a good few are safe on parry, meaning you can get punished for trying to punish things out of shield that really shouldn't be safe (such as dash attacks or smashes on shield). Another example is the fact that you can no longer run through opponents. The addition of parrying over perfect shielding makes sense to me (even if it's worse when you think about projectiles) but there is literally no reason to add this in. It restricts your options and it was never even a problem to begin with, so all it does is mess people up who are transitioning from past smash games and limit options for those who have adapted to Ultimate. It's a really stupid addition that took away from the game for no foreseeable reason.

Additionally, while some roster additions were good, others weren't really a joy. Like... Piranha Plant? A minor Mario enemy over a notable character such as Toad, Waluigi, or Birdo? Heck, if you want to add Piranha Plant just add Petey Piranha and it'd be the same thing with a lot less visible injustice done to the other Mario characters. And other additions such as Daisy and Richter as echos and not skins (even though they have almost no differences whatsoever), the addition of Incineroar over Decidueye (a Pokemon who actually had a following got trumped by one whose was very small before Ultimate/the leak), and more Fire Emblem fighters we didn't need (at least Pokemon and Mario are top-selling franchises) are debatable.

Then there are other holes in the game such as the online mode. Nintendo knows that online is flagship game mode for many players; it was put on the main menu screen in Smash 4. But now you must have the online service to play it? It's not as integral to Smash as it is to other games, such as Splatoon, but many competitive players cannot make tournaments or there are no tournaments in their area. And even then, in a casual aspect, playing online with friends is a great experience. Online did not have to be paid for; that felt a bit shoed in. And the online mode itself. Global Smash Power is completely sporadic in what you lose/get rewarded for winning and it's a poor measurement of skill. I'll beat many opponents in a row only to get pounded by opponents way better than me for the next couple of games. Did I hit a skill ceiling for that time? Yeah. But I shouldn't be all the way up there if I suck that bad (lol).

Finally, World of Light. It is not good. It's pretty overrated in my opinion. It's definitely not a ""big Smash Tour 2.0"" like some have been comparing it to, but if you want to be brutally honest about what it is, it's literally just a bunch of Special Smash matches with customs on. If you play Special Smash with customs on and give your opponent advantages, that is basically World of Light in a nutshell. I never really found it fun. Others have, and that's okay. But the fact is that it's pretty challenging for newer players (I'm fine with the difficulty but it is really hard on newer players), even on easy, and it's just nothing special like the Subspace Emissary.

In short, the game has a lot of features that drag it down that really don't have to be there at all. I feel like some things they did with the mechanics, shielding, speed, and other additions do not help the game. World of Light and some of the newer characters were pretty disappointing either due to expectations or what was portrayed.

There are other complaints, but overall, it's good. It just has a lot of minor issues and dumb things about it that bog it down and make it feel a lot worse than it really is. 7 or 7.5/10.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
cpolizzi,11-02-2019,This is the best! smash bros in the series. It's phenomenal. You should totatly buy it. And once you beat the world of light you can change the menu music. I changed mine to brawl's theme and it makes the game so much better.,10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
WhenDLCis_FREE,11-02-2019,"Smash Brothers Ultimate is another astounding example of how Nintendo’s library of games is worth exploring. I honestly feel that this is one of the best modern fighting games since USF4 and Melee. The colors are bright and vibrant, and every single map either brings nostalgia from older smash games, or newer maps bring other franchises to the table. I haven’t even gotten to the characters! Every character in smash plays just how you think they would. Many of the movesets assigned to a playable character are references to the game the character comes from. For example, Simon Belmont from the Castlevania series, who is a new addition to the roster, has a side-B move that has him throw his cross-shaped boomerang that damages the opponent. If you didn’t know already, that is a reference to the same boomerang that is used as a sub-weapon in the Castlevania games. That’s just a small glimpse of all the references and allusions there are to the characters in this game, and there are 74 characters and counting. Would definitely recommend for any Nintendo, or video game fan.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Legozeldadude,12-02-2019,"Smash Ultimate is a must have for any avid video game fan out there.

Let’s get the bad stuff out of the way first. The stages were kind of underwhelming for me. How come we couldn’t unlock stages? And of all the stages to bring back, why 75m, Great Cave Offensive, and Pac-land? (not valid criticism, just wanted to say it). The lack of the extra modes is disappointing. Where the heck is Event match? And no Target Test either? Lastly, I’ve heard the online is utter garbage, which is okay, since I am not big on competitive gaming.

Now to the positives. Classic mode is loads of fun, best in the series thus far. Unlocking characters through classic mode is relatively easy. The characters are balanced, and such a great roster (although they need more Zelda characters, but that’s just because I’m a total Zelda fanboy). World of Light might not be as story driven as I would have liked, but the story is up to interpretation, which is amazing. It may be difficult at times, but it is probably because I suck at video games, rarely because it is unfair. Most of the stages are fine, with a few exceptions. The music is spectacular, although there are some tracks that I would like to be in that aren’t. I’m so excited for DLC, just please don’t have a new Fire Emblem character.

The lack of extra modes and unlockable stages. If Nintendo could add more modes and have stages be unlockable, then this game would be a perfect 10. Maybe Nintendo should add another ballot, but for music tracks, but that’s not really a problem. Smash Ultimate is a game that I will be playing for years to come, and I support Mr. Sakurai on whatever he plans. Just don’t add Goku. As long as Goku is not in Smash, I will play every new smash game when it comes out.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Jb_epicgamer,15-02-2019,"Super Smash Bros Ultimate is the pinacle of the series.
Back in the day i played Brawl, and i had some fun.
When 3DS first came out i played it a ton.

This one i have played every day since launch.

There is a reason for that.

The Combat is the main gameplay mechanic, it feels natural, like tying your shoes, it all flows like water from your hands to the buttons, creating combos with smash attacks and special attacks. Moving the stick in directions for more variation really spices up scenarios. Speaking of spicing, Spirits when used in combat can create chaos to the maximum, like dealing 999 damage inn a single move.

But i must adresss the other big mode, Word of Light, My Goly goodness, this thing is incredibly satisfying. Traversing the world map is very responsive and snappy. Spirit battles can be super intense and are often trail and error but that just leads to the fun. Also that ending, oh the ending.

muramoto_chang,18-02-2019,"This game really needed an extra couple of years of development. While fun, the flaws of this game are glaring to say the least. First off, the single-player modes can get very **** rage inducing. World of Light is honestly one of the most poorly designed single player modes I have ever seen. To begin with, it is a monotonous slog-fest 60 percent of the time when you can just ram through battles in less than 10 seconds, and the other 40 percent it is the most **** design ever. Your skill in this game won't matter in these stages, if you need proof then watch some videos of Nairo playing. One of the top players in competitive Sm4sh regularly gets his ass handed to him and he resorts to cheering. Classic mode isn't much better, half of the time I'm wondering who in TF thought that it was a smart idea to have some characters have allies in classic and others to go 1v4. You are regularly hit with some next level dumbass battles and once again, you're gonna have to cheese. So if the singleplayer has that many flaws, then the multiplayer's gotta be great right? Nah, the online lags like we're playing in the middle of the Amazon Jungle and the matchmaking pits 70k GSP scrubs with ZeRo half the time. Despite the shortcomings, it's still a Smash game and it's fun with your friends. The large roster is great, each fighter has it's own strengths and weaknesses and learning them is fun as hell.",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The Classic Mode are neat nods to said franchises or to their classification. The online is a little finicky, but it tries it's best to give you the least amount of trouble.

iMustang,24-03-2019,"The Ultimate package indeed! As if the overwhelming cast of characters, music, and stages wasn't enough this game has so much potential of things to do, more than any fighting game I've ever enjoyed. The single player journey inspired me to try out every single fighter, something I've not done since the original N64 game, and challenges you with the awesome addition of spirits. Spirits made the game always feel unique, with feelings like 'What's this one going to do' or ""Oh yay they're in this game' at every twist and turn. They also help you become a better Smash player, as some of their challenges were just brutal. But that difficultly made this game even more fun to me, in fact I'd say World of Light was my favorite part. That drive is going to keep me playing Super Smash Bros Ultimate for months, maybe even years to come, and no Smash Bros has ever had that effect on me before.

I mean, I get that the spirits are just PNGs, and Waluigi and others are still assist trophies, but still, the game plays fantastic. They acknowledge echo fighters and how they're kinda re-skins, and the automatic changes to final smashes just appeal to the fast paced nature of the series.
And can we not talk about the graphics? The details on each fighter? The amazing rehashes of old stages (rip poke floats)? The menus, man. The menus.

Regarding single-player...Adventure sure is hard to complete, but I think it's at the area of subspace quality. Classic mode is good with all the different routes for every fighter. (smash Wii U/3DS was sub-par) But...no home-run contest, target smash or stage creator. Nothing yet, I'm hoping.

Online definitely needs some works. No local co-op in battle arenas, and GSP kinda sucks. (Maybe it's just Nintendo trying to be original? I dunno.)

Mob smash is just a drag as well. however classic mode is the best its EVER been with every character having a themed route and a plethora of bosses it is a fun romp. however, where the game shines is multiplayer. with a roster of 70 unique characters plus 7 echo (clone) characters, there's going to be at least one you will like. every character plays different to some degree and while some do play similarly (EX: Ness and lucas) they all FEEL different and with 5 more characters and stages this has a lot of variety. as for the stage selection theres, 103 plus each stage had beta (what i call battlefield stages) and omega (final destination) stages bring the number to 309!!!!!!!!! sure some stages are better then other (SCREW 75M) however you also have fan favorites like yoshis story, fountain of dreams, dream land, cornaria, lylat cruise, halberd, both pokemon stadiums, mario bros (ok that ones just my personal favorite) and so many more complete with a redesigned battlefield and final destination. and to accompany the your fight the game has 800+ music tracks to listen to while you play and 90% of them are bangers! i have seen people complain about online and quickplay but i think its fine battle arenas are my favorite though. and finally spirits. to summarize what spirits are they basically turn the game into the Chaos 4 mod pack ranging from a slight speed buff to GRANTING 4 JUMPS. overall this game is sharp fast and fun and it's a game i have already sunk 400+ hours into. if you have someone who has never played a smash game this is the one they need to start with

This game is truly an homage to Nintendo's rich history; with more than 1.000 spirit battles and unique Classic Modes for each fighter and their echo-counterparts.

Despite that, the game has lingering issues. While the online mode has been improved since launch, it still has many problems. The game also has high input lag, making it feel unresponsive, which is very bad for a game where you want to be in full control of the action! The game can also feel very repetitive. With the removal of extra modes, such as target test and the lack of a true story mode, the different game modes are very similar, which can become boring after a while.

I recommend Smash Bros. Ultimate to any fan of Nintendo's amazing game series or to any Nintendo-fan in general. The game is not perfect, but if you have enjoyed any Smash game in the past, you will enjoy this game for many many hours.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Han pulido mucho todos los aspectos jugables, el juego desprende mimo, curro, ambición y contenido (tanto para un jugador como multijugador) por todos lados. Además lo van manteniendo vivo con los DLC y las actualizaciones. Una cantidad brutal de canciones, personajes y escenarios. Modos nuevos muy interesantes y los ya existentes están mejor cuidados y son entretenidos. El juego ha hecho historia, dudo que se vuelva a repetir en una próxima entrega de la saga.

nintendofan64,04-04-2019,I started playing smash ever since brawl then 4 and now ultimate the game's story mode is pretty good but KINDA stealing from avengers 3 but hey bayonetta got nerfed ultimate is one of the best smash games now with ALL of the characters NEW characters WALUIGI DID NOT GET IN SMASH! classic is back and DAAAAAAAAAAAAMN it good the games online however...oh boy this is a long one people need to spend money on the online membership only to spend MORE money on good connection. SPOILERS AHEAD FOR THE ADVETURE MODE so when you defeat galeem you meet darkkon and his army of crazy hands but when you defeat him YOU GET TO SAVE THE HANDS TO LATER PLAY AS MASTER HAND!!!THEN YOU GET THE CHOICE TO FIGHT GALEEM DARKKON OR BOTH!!!so basicly its a must have for anyone that owns a switch,10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
dbomb,13-04-2019,"this game is amazing, it has everything I would want in a smash game, even when they didn't bring back a few gamemodes I still felt like I could do a lot of things in this game, even the online can be fun sometimes even if it's not that good, this game is really fun for people who want to have fun, and really competitive for people who play competitive but can also be both at the same time, I could really see how they made this game fit for every nintendo fan. The spirits mode was really fun too. I really liked the new spirits mechanic. This game also can customized a lot, both in game, and with physical controllers, even the chaotic 8 player smash feels fun when you play with friends. Everything I saw before release ended up becoming better than I hoped it would, like the new squad strike and smashdown gamemodes. This game is really fast paced and you can play whoever you want, it is balanced and you don't have to worry about your character being bad. Nintendo did not disappoint after the year and a half of waiting. This has definitely been the best buy for the switch for me.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
Epicgamer69,14-04-2019,"Super smash bros ultimate is a great game full of fun and interesting characters, ranging from all of your favourite Nintendo games. The game is best at local multiplayer and is a blast with friends but, for single player it could be better. For single player you have there options world of light,online and single player battles/classic mode. Online is very laggy and needs working on and, single player battles with cpu’s gets boring quick. Classic mode is where you chose a character and have a premade set of battles. I have the same problem with classic mode and single player battles because it is practically the same thing. World of light is the big story mode in this game but is just again the same as single player battle except it’s really really stretched out. Now just because the solo play isn’t great doesn’t mean this game is bad. If you have a switch go get this game already.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
YourFriendNeo,15-04-2019,"Super smash bros Ultimate is a damn well amazing game but, it has its flaws such as Bad online, DLC at launch for a full priced game and, very limited story mode. this is my second favorite in the franchise because its game play is the best in the series but, i still prefer brawl because of its amazing story, adding final smashes, great cetacean, level editor and, finally adding third party charterers. i hate to see people giving this game a zero though just because they didn't get their omega favorite character in smash. In my personal opinion i would wait another 5 years for a better ultimate and, i wouldn't want Sakuri to push himself as hard as he did making this game in 2 years and instead took his time. overall i give it an 8, i realy just want brawl ported to switch if you couldn't tell.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
ShadowMario9994,15-04-2019,"So after watching ""NintendoBlackCrisis"" videos of bad reviews, it gave me the courage to make a good review of this game. All I will say that's bad is the online mode. Its hard to get in a match and the GSP makes no sense but its not the major problem. Its still doable to play and the other modes are very good to play. The World of Light is amazing with its story. Compared to Subspace, they're a little the same with WOL being slightly higher. The story is amazing with Galeem, Dharkon, and all previous Smash bosses with new ones added like Ganon and Dracula. The fights get a little repetitive and the AI is challenging but thats what makes it fun, i mean you wouldnt ragequit on a CPU right? The proper Smash modes for you and your friends to play is great, Smashdown, Custom Smash, Tourney, Stamina. Plus Classic Mode with is a huge improvement to the others like Sm4sh and 64, having each character have they're own pathway based on their games. The icing on this cake is the newcomers, not as much compared to Sm4sh, but the most demanding characters, like Inkling, Ridley, and King K. Rool, and favorite Echos and Returning Characters like Daisy, Young Link, and Wolf. Some like the Belmonts, Chrom, Ken, and Dark Samus were expected and Incineroar and Isabelle were odd choices but doesnt bring this game down. 74 characters with more for DLC makes this the Ultimate Smash game. If you like the Super Smash Bros series or Fighting Games in general, you should definitely get this game. My only complaint is the online mode, I wish it was better than it is right now. Everything else including Story Mode, Classic Mode, and Smash Modes are excellent. The choice is yours.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

sluigi123,20-06-2020,"This game's series has been around for (as of the creation of this review) over 20 years and each game after the previous has been improved very heavily each time, in terms of visuals and mechanics.

Gameplay-wise, this game hasn't fairly changed much in terms of its mechanics, but the game has been made to have an overall increased pace, when comparing it to the previous Smash Bros. title. Its visualizations have been updated to be a combination of both Smash Bros. Brawl for the reduced saturation, and Smash Bros. for Wii-U for the visual looks of the characters themselves. You can actually play the game the same way as you would have played it since Smash Bros. for the Nintendo 64. You can play this game with your friends locally with up to 8 players all at once, or online with up to 4 players, across the huge roster of over 75 characters and over 100 stages to choose from. This game has a lot of Single-Player content, and I mean a lot: Spirits/Adventure Mode, Classic Mode, Stage Builder, Home-Run Contest, Mii Fighters, and so much more to mess around in.

This game may have a lot of good things about itself, but it does have one major issue as far as I know, and that is its net-code infrastructure. This game takes a similar approach to how things worked roughly 15-20 years back, which uses delay-based net-code, causing issues on every player in terms of inputs being heavily delayed for them, except the host player which wouldn't have this issue, which give them a huge advantage, which causes issues when trying to balance this game's character roster. Like I said about Rocket League, this game also has the same toxicity issue, similar to many other fighting games out there as well, causing this game to be overly competitive at times.

I really can't say much else when it comes to its negativity for this game. Like I said earlier, this game has improved over its previous titles, each and every time a new game has come out, and this game is no exception either. A very good game that can last a very long time, with a very long, yet active life cycle, as this game is getting DLC content (and still is upon this reviewing), in terms of characters and stages, increasing the game's rosters, extending the game's active life cycle even further than ever before.

A very great game that deserves to be worth $50 to get a hold of for your family and friends to hop on in and enjoy to create really fun moments with.

NOTE: I may be a fan of this series, but putting on my reviewing cap on, I have to put my personal opinions off to the side to be more serious about this game's scoring process to be as accurate as possible.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
KiwiRatesStuff,18-04-2019,"It's the best Smash game, period. Online just needs a bit of fixing, and the game could possibly be considered one of the best Nintendo games, period.

Speedie,02-05-2019,"The game as a whole is so satisfying to play, with every attack feeling skillful and accurate. As a party game and competitive game, Smash stands out above just about every other fighting game, and the new Adventure mode can keep anybody playing the game whether or not the friends are around. If played like a new version of one of its predecessors, Melee, then this game is the new and improved Smash. That being said, the online servers are really bad, even five months after the game's release, several updates, and the fact that the game is on the Switch. With a new ranked system in a competitive fighting game, you think it would be their primary focus to perfect the online, but now. Not only do the connection issues make the game unplayable at times, but even when you do get into a good game, there's a chance it's not the mode you have as your preferred mode, meaning you'll lose rank based off of a game mode you didn't even want.

The online feature of this game could have made it the last Smash Nintendo ever needed to made, but there are still some flaws that the game has always struggled with. Play this game with your friends, or at LAN tournaments, but don't be driven away by the online as so many people have been already.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The new characters are OKEY...I really liked Simon, he's on my main team...but the online....dam...the online sucks, I really hope nintendo fix it...

the custome smash make many wierd momets that you will keep lathing more than fighting.
the mii custmization have so many possibilities that anyone and anything can join the smash roaster, eaven your grandmother.
it's classic mode lacks off brake the targets and board the platforms, but each character has it's own uneque classig mode and multiples final bosses.
the recently added stage builder allow anyone to put your criativity to work and show the results to anyone in the internet.
the video editor help to make many simple, yet funny videos to share.
smash world is also a really cool feature, you can share clips, montages, mii fighters and the previously mensioned crated stages to show epic or funny stuff to all smasher.
but, no game is perfect, smash ultimate's major flaws start at adventure mode (world of light): it is a really long ""table game"" where you have to do lots of fights, it is funny at the begining but it becomes way too repetitive, it have a few puzzles here and there but that's it, it doesn't have any memorable moment untill the final boss.
the secound big flaw is it's online mode, if you play smash bros ultimate, you know what i'm talking about, there is way too much lag in every single match, which make characters that require precise imputs unplayable, shiek is considered by many mid-tier or high-mid-tier but online she is as good as smash 4 jiglypuff since you are never able to use your best combos which is awful since now you have to pay for the online services and yet the only game whith good online servers on the Nintendo switch is splatoon 2 and some third party games and no other Nintendo game.

single player there is a lot to offer from stage builder to home run contest to the adventure mode to spirits and more
online mode *deep breath* is ultimates biggest problem as the online is bad really bad at times it is perfect and at other times it is unplayable. Online matchmaking is dumb gsp makes no darn sense and it supports really annoying campy playstyles.

GreenMenace,15-06-2022,"This review has been a long time coming. SSBU was my first game on the Switch followed by BOTW. I’ve explored most of what the game has to offer (aside from competitive online play) and I can confidently assert that it lives up to its name. It is an ultimate Super Smash Bros game.

Pros
Solid DLC
Familiar gameplay—if you’ve played Smash, you know the game
Custom Stages
Smooth gameplay/controls

Cons
Clones
Personal Preferences

Starting off, I’ve tried everything extensively except competitive online. SSBU is an amazing entry that has mastered the Super Smash Bros formula. Playing online? That usually includes a wait time. No worries, the game allows you to practice your moves on a sandman while you wait to learn the character / warm up. It lets you customize a battle—add a handicap to the best player, control which items show up, have all players have a flower on a head, play levels from previous SSB entries, and a ton more content.

There are a ton of player modes. You can go to the vault to browse/create levels, fight in Spirit Mode, hold a tournament with friends with up to eight players at a time, fight matches online, and again, a ton more. It’s hard to narrow down a topic because there really is a lot of content in Super Smash Bros.

The game has every Super Smash Bros character ever created. But that leads us to the first flaw. Several characters look mildly different, but have identical attack animations. Peach and Daisy (their color). Marth and Lucina (hair length and gender). The difference is the impact of the moves. In Marth and Lucina’s case, Marth does more damage if you hit people at the tip of your sword. That and a different voice are not enough in my opinion to classify the two as separate characters. Let Daisy be her own character. Let Marth remain independent of Lucina. When you factor in the number of clones, the roster loses a chunk of its value. However, I have been very, very pleased with each DLC. Each character there was well thought out and is fun to play.

A similar criticism I have is on the Smash ultimates. Many feel the same. I skipped a gen of Smash Bros, but you could have characters that had Smash ultimates that did something other than damage. Luigi created a zone where enemies slowed down, Bowser turned into Giga Bowser, etc. What also hurts is that some ultimates (cough cough Zelda) are extremely easy to hit and are a guaranteed kill once someone has taken enough damage. It’s for those characters alone that I can’t bring myself to use the FS meter. Some levels I like to create are focused on the aspect of making people hard to kill (I like to try to think of levels that favor certain characters). Several ultimates and assist trophies are guilty of ruining that experience.

I’m not crazy about the single player story mode. It was far too grindy and complicated so I skipped it. Other players like it, but it wasn’t my cup of tea. Another disappointment are the levels people share online. Like, so many levels are designed to blow up your character in 5 seconds. I gave up on it pretty fast. But that’s not the game’s fault lol. What really gets me upset is that Nintendo made it really hard to play with friends online. I understand the necessity of a pay wall, but I think two people should be able to join an online battle. Like, those features would only encourage players to have a copy. Mariokart 8 offers a feature somewhat similar to that. One person per copy gets in the way of families being able to take advantage of the game. Families (I'm talking about immediate families) should not have to buy multiple copies of the game to play online with long distance family members who also bought the game--that's disgusting. But that's a gripe about NSO more than SSBU so I won't factor that in either.

You would think that games on the switch would improve over the Switch’s lifespan, but that doesn’t hold true here. Super Smash Bros Ultimate looks good, and it plays really well too. It surprises me just how well it runs on the Switch. Truly the ultimate version of an ultimate game. Maybe they’ll create a new Smash Bros, but Smash Bros Ultimate might be what defines Super Smash Bros for the next several years.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

With smash ultimate, i still suck at it, but i can appreciate it for what it is, a love letter to gaming, there's no better feeling than seeing isabella from animal crossing beat up cloud from final fantasy 7.

My only issue with the game are the controls, basing this in the joycons or a pro controller, it feels a little clunky to get used to at first, however if your willing to pick up a gamecube adapter (not the official one since it's so expensive) and a controller, it feels at least a little more natural with the button placements and with the analog stick.

I have tried online with wifi and with a cable but nothing works it always lags at the worst times and it seems that the newer players adapt quicker to the lag and win on pure luck when i'm used to normally functioning matches. Smash 4 is better in every aspect and more content doesn't mean more game to enjoy. I haven't played like half of the stuff in this game because i couldn't give less about anything.

It's probably my favorite game because you never get bored of grinding new characters playing online or in tournaments. I can see how people can get bored of it if they play with items on, all stages, stage hazards on and free for alls. If you play with competitive ruleset you wont get bored. The buffer system and 6 frame input delay can eat your inputs, lower your reaction time, ect. The pros out way the cons 200% . Very fun for non-casuals.",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

SirSoil,28-02-2020,"Super Smash Bros Ultimate is the best game ever made, with the variety of options modes characters stages and a super fun satisfying gameplay. By far this game is the easiest fighting game to learn playing, it’s super satisfying all the characters feel good to control. Speaking of characters there is over 70+ characters, 70+ characters can you believe this **** Also over 100+ stages with the actual heck! Not to mention the amount of modes this game has, the spirit mode is the most underrated thing it’s idea and execution is done perfectly. It’s basically a collection of amazing characters from big or small franchises , you use them to assist you in battle and it makes the feeling of everyone is here even stronger which is genius. The adventure mode is perfect for smash bros, it has you go in a giant map and fight fighters spirits and sometimes a perfectly well made boss, the bosses are perfect all of them. Also the additional modes such as classic mode the spirit mode and more are so well made. The main mode the smash mode is perfectly executed, with a variety of new modes such as smash down and squad strike makes this game better by the second. The online works well yes the main mode “quick play” Isn’t the best, but I personally believe that battle arenas really really really make up for it. The most impressive addition by far is the amount of music tracks in this game, there is over 850+ music tracks WTF WHO CAN MANGE THAT! I seriously believe this game has so much love put into it and that’s something I proudly appreciate with my experience as a gamer and a reviewer. Super Smash Bros Ultimate deserves all the prays all the love and all the appreciation, it’s a game that must be taken as a celebration of video games and it keeps going with so many characters stages music tracks modes quality of life improvements and most importantly the love that was put into this game not to mention we are getting even more stuff in the future which is insanely amazing, I strongly believe Super Smash Bros Ultimate Is The Greatest Video Game Ever Made And I’m gonna give it a new ranking because I personally believe this game is perfect! (A Perfect Masterpiece 5/5) You Must Play It!",10,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I would give this game a 10 if it weren't for the greed of Nintendo - it pains me SO much that if you want all of the characters, you have to buy both Fighter's Passes which is going to cost you ANOTHER 50 dollars on top of the 60 you already paid. 60 Dollars for this game is beyond worth it, but 50 for 10 more is a rip-off.

I don't like this prospect, I think that maybe Nintendo should stop with all the new fighter DlCs because they are putting extremely good characters in there that other regular characters can't compete with, just try fighting a Byleth with any character from the non DLC roster, I dare you, that and the online play being so laggy (FIX YOUR SERVERS ALREADY!) makes it impossible, so far you have to pay for both fighter collections, each, and with, what? 10 or more coming out it's going to start to become an EA game, and we've all seen the memes.",6,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

The roster is impossible and some how Daddy Sakurai did it again! I will admit modes are lacking but the normal gameplay and characters make up for it! Online has improved compared to past entries but still could use improvement on Nintendo's part!

An impressive roster, over 100 courses and great extras and parameters, La Da, certainly recycled from the Wii U opus, remains to be seen. With the OST we are well in the pantheon of video games, a museum well respected except 2 negative points. The spirit mode, the long, but boring story mode and the spirits replaces the trophies, a serious shortage of time for our dear Sakurai. The 2nd black point is the disastrous online world (Nintendo does not know how to do online). Impossible to play in a service at 20 euros a year.

Dave300,02-05-2020,"Super Smash Bros. is a gift for gamers! This amazing game series is a unique fighting game that features our fav video game characters! And Ultimate is the best fighting game I have ever played! This game has our fav Nintendo characters like Mario, Link, Samus, Pikachu, Donkey Kong and more and third party characters like Sonic, Pac-man, Solid Snake, Ryu, Cloud and more. Also third party DLC characters like Joker, Hero, Banjo and Kazoiee, Terry and more to come! This game has an amazing and unique gameplay. Controls are easy to learn and use so this game is faster than the other fighting games. One of the best thing this game does is it can be competitive and casual at the same time! Like I said it's easy to play but you can main a character and learn how to play him for competitive play and his/her combos and his/her strategies! This game is super fun and has more than 70 characters featuring every character from the past Smash games! All the characters are different from each other. There are a lot of ways to win. İnstead of fighting your oppenent till his health bar is gone, you have to launch him out of the stage! İnstead of a health bar it shows how much damage have the characters took! More damage means that they will fly more when they take a hit! So you have to fight the oppenent and do combos and be strategic and kill him with a strong hit or you can kill him with a spike that kills the oppenent at a low percent with launching them down and is special for some characters or you can kill with critical hit which is special for some characters too or you can kill with your special that gets actived when your smash meter is full but it is optional! This game also has modes like super fun adventure mode, classic mode and a lot more! And there is online which is the most fun part out of the game but it doesn't really work that good. İt is fun but could have been so much better and hope they will fix it but this still doesn't change the fact that how amazing this masterpiece is!

ClassyGoose,19-06-2020,"I love this game I do but, some parts of this game make me mad. This would be the best smash game or on par with melee if 2 things were done better. First, the story mode is lackluster and it feels more like a grind than an actual story I wish there was something different to do than fight spirits (e.g Platforming ) the story mode isn't too big of a complaint though. The main reason I'm writing this review is the online, The online is just terrible. The net code is a joke and the possibility of not even getting the ruleset you want feels like a 15 percent chance. Now if you don't play this game competitively then you will hardly notice anything, however, I have 600 hours (as of the time writing this) in Smash Ultimate. The number of times I have been in matches where the game freezes, I disconnect, or the input delay is horrendous just makes me so mad. The online is terrible and Nintendo acting like it doesn't exist along with Smash having preferred rules and the option not even working some of the time just adds fuel the fire. Even though the Smash community has tried to get their voices heard in the past they have just been ignored by Nintendo. Besides a lackluster story and terrible online, this game is perfect and is one of Nintendo's best Switch games. The roster of characters keeps growing through dlc and the game continues to grow. Sakurai and his team continue to make Smash the best it can be by patching characters and adding them.

Inorde,18-02-2021,"As a newcomer to Smash this was quite overwhelming. Basically it's a fighting game with lots and lots of characters and lots and lots of options. Then there's the single player campaign with and endless stream of special power-ups en ways to enhance your abilities. The many stages have lots of things that can happen. What you end up with is a load of surprises every time you start the game, and the only way to master it is by playing hundreds and hundreds of hours to master the different fighters and to learn all there is to learn in this massive game.

I'm still not hooked on the game, but there's no denying that this game is very big and very well-executed. There are just so many ways to play the game, and there's so much to discover. The difficulty can be set very low. And although a victory isn't very satisfying then it allows you to discover what your character can do. Classic mode automatically ups the difficulty if you win too easily.

Multiplayer I've mainly done locally. It's fun even if you lose. There's a lot of options to setup tournaments.

My issue with the online capabilities. Every other console and my PC I have works fantastic with my internet, both on Wifi and using ethernet. The game is laggy and disconnects frequently, almost evert game. All of Nintendo's (admittedly great) games are fantastic, but with Nintendo's god-awful online service games are unplayable in COVID. I can't exactly go to my friend's and play at the moment, which makes Nintendo's use of an almost 20 year old online service software abundantly clear. They've said they are going to change to a new online service, but its been months and a time estimate has never been given, and I suspect by the end of 2021 we won't see any progress. Even Melee, a 20 year old game, has an online system far superior, which was made by modders. It's just sad.

Darksamus51,25-08-2021,"Oh Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, I so want to like you. But I just can't.

I want to state this now, before my review. I have played ultimate since about 6 months into it's release. This is not coming from a person who picked the game up once and went, ""Screw this."" This is coming from someone who has spent 370 hours in the game. Also for those who think, oh he probably just hasn't tried hard enough. I am not the type of person to give up when I hit a wall in a game. I spent almost 45 minutes watching a video about a game I hadn't even played yet because I wanted to be better at it when I actually did play it. I learn speed-run strats in fps games so that I can be better in multiplayer. I have tried certain racing game stages hundreds of times to get better by even a split second. Sure I have my breaking points, but I'm no push over when it comes to a challenge. I play Rocket League for goodness sake, a game that is literally all about how much time and effort you put into it.

THE REVIEW STARTS HERE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For all those who are unfamiliar with Smash Ultimate. Don't expect that when you see the tag ""Fighting Game"" that you are going to play a consistent, skillful, and strategic game. No. Expect to play against a bunch of people who spam the same two moves over and over and over and over and over and over again.

This is by far the most inconsistent feeling smash game of the bunch. The game rewards camping and spamming heavily. Maybe because there are so many characters who can camp and spam comfortably.

I know there will be people who think, Pros don't spam, and if a Pro went against a spammer the Pro would win. I beg to differ. I saw a game between two Pros and for one of his stocks one of the Pros, as the announcer called it, (paraphrasing) ""Didn't spam, but strategically threw each of ivysaur's leaf blades a bunch of times to hit his enemy."" I call that spamming.

Another example is when a particular Pro that I won't mention here, said he legitimately spammed smash attacks and won as the worst character in the game (Little Mac) against a Pro.

I don't know whether it's the horrible servers, my wifi, or the way the game was built, but the amount of times I have said, ""That's not what I pressed."" Or ""Where was my attack I pressed to do?"" is insane. Now I am positive that a decent amount of those times were me being a little sloppy with inputs, but certainly not EVERY FREAKING TIME! Good lord the amount of games that I should have won but the attack I did ""missed"" or ""didn't register"" hurts my head. I don't remember this sort of stuff happening nearly as much in Brawl.

I have flip flopped between characters on this game FAAAAAAR MORE than I ever did Brawl or smash 4. The game feels so inconsistent that I have tried time and time again to find a character that works for me and even to this day I question if I have found the right one. (currently it's Cloud, and I dislike sword fighter characters, so idk)

The biggest thing going for the game is the amount of characters in it, which seems to be the thing that people are constantly blinded by. Having more characters in a game is inherently going to make it more clunky and unwieldy. Imagine trying to keep 74, almost 75, characters balanced, it's a joke! Now don't get me wrong, for having 74 characters in the game, there isn't a fighter that I think dominates the scene, which is a decent achievement of game design.

I barely touch Spirits, it's not that fun, not that interesting. There's barely a story. Very few cutscenes. And it is extremely easy when using spirits even on the hard difficulty. Subspace Emissary was something I replayed quite a few times, but I usually forget that Spirit's exists.

Let's get the behemoth in the room over with. Sakurai. Believe me, I respect Sakurai a lot. But what he chooses to do and not to do is simply his job and his choice. Everybody get's angry when people say something bad about the game because, ""Sakurai and his team have put so much love into the game."" I don't doubt that they have. But not every criticism can or should be washed away with, ""But Sakurai is great!"" or ""There are so many characters!"" Please let's think critically, and not simply say, ""Oh, he dislikes the game? He must be bad."" ""Oh, the attack didn't register? Must have been because you're bad or you have bad wifi."" or the classic, ""GEt GuD!""

The game did add a lot of stages and retain a lot of stages which is great! Music selection is off the chain! Having a training area is exactly what Smash needed.

Nintendo ha hecho un gran trabajo en este juego, pudo juntar a todos los jugadores casuales y a los jugadores más competitivos en un solo juego, la relevancia que ha tenido Ultimate en la actualidad es notable, y el roster es el más grande que ha tenido la franquicia. Carece un poco en el modo historia, es disfrutable, completo y con buenos retos, pero se extrañan muchas veces las cinemáticas. El Online si bien no es perfecto, ha mejorado en comparación a lo ofrecido en Smash 4, con una buena conexión puedes pasar horas, y no es broma, jugando en la Nintendo Switch, no por nada es el juego que más tiempo he invertido en esta consola.

ec1123,28-04-2022,"what can i say. it's smash. almost everyone knows about this game. In sports, there's usually a clearer divide between casual and competitive players because well... you need different equipment for different sports. In fighting games, you just need a controller and on top of that, gamers are usually just happy to play anybody because they live in caves.

What this does is it mixes casuals with competitive players much too often. If my matches are kind of even, I'll have more fun and want to compete better, but if they're not....obviously I lose interest or I'm the other guy, exploiting people's weaknesses to troll them. Either way, it makes for a shallow experience and not fully redeeming experience. When you're playing a good single-player game, you can just say fk everyone else.

That being said, I like Sakurai (rest in peace Iwata) and the game can be fun especially with lots of friends. This game is capable of generating a lot of loud noises if the players are engaged and skilled enough.

Super Smash Bros. is a fascinating franchise, what started as a fun party game transcended into something very special.

Much like its predecessors, it's pure chaotic fun, be it single player or multiplayer, there's a crazy amount of content and customization.

The character roster is insane, there are around 90 characters to choose from in total, which is perhaps the biggest roster in any game ever.

The soundtrack is packed with some of the most iconic videogame music, from old school to modern, it's the most diverse soundtrack to date.

An amalgamation of every single Super Smash Bros. game combined into one huge package, an entire videogame Museum that consists of some of the most popular and beloved videogame franchises in history. This game reminds me of my childhood in every single way, and I couldn't be more satisfied.

nintendofan721,05-03-2022,"This is the ultimate Super Smash Bros game! There is so much content with way more than ever before! Literally every single character from past games is in with no one cut, while there are a few great newcomers too like Inkling, Ridley and King K Rool. There are over 100 stages with most of them being retro stages that are graphically updated to look way better! There’s over 900 music tracks, which is massive, and most of these tunes are bangers! The core gameplay is the best we’ve seen in the series so far, it’s really smooth and controls well. World of light was okay but nowhere near the magic of the Subspace Emissary in brawl. Feels more like a long series of event matches. There aren’t as many side modes which is one of my favourite things about the series. They did add Home Run Contest and Stage Builder later on but they should have been there from the start. I love this game on its own but the main reason I can’t give it a higher score is due to the direction it went down post launch. It now feels like the game is nothing but a vehicle to create hype. It’s being targeted towards YouTubers and twitch streamers who scream and overreact to some dumb character announcement. There is so much more to the Super Smash Bros franchise than just characters. I feel like Sakurai has taken the series into a bad direction with the DLC. Speaking of the DLC, most of the characters we got are awful with only a couple that I thought were cool to see. Super Smash Bros is supposed to be a fighting/party game where elements from across Nintendo’s different franchises come together and provide the best experience possible. Now it’s like anyone from any video game can get in which ruins it. Luckily they are done with the DLC so they can’t rely on Smash to create hype anymore. But overall, Ultimate is a good game and a great experience if you’re looking for tons of characters and stages.",8,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

Lewisbwh,03-03-2022,"I have sunk 700+ hours into Ultimate. This game is incredible. Smash Bros. Ultimate is possibly the greatest crossover game ever made. The amount of variety in this game in the characters and franchises added is incredible.

You have your standard Nintendo Franchises which have been in it from the start, Mario, Zelda, Donkey Kong, Metroid, Pokemon, etc. You also have a few characters from M Rated series such as Snake from Metal Gear Solid and Bayonetta. Pac-Man and Sonic along with Pikachu and Mario probably make Smash Ultimate, not just the game with the most recognizable characters ever, but media product in general. Cloud and Sephiroth from Final Fantasy, Steve from Minecraft, Joker from Persona 5, Banjo from Banjo-Kazooie, Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter, Kazuya from Tekken. The shear amount of characters in this game from different genres and origins, RPGs, First and Third Person Shooters, Platformers, Action Adventures, Sandbox, even Racing Games and Life Simulator games are represented. Smash is such a massive crossover that even Disney (notoriously infamous for their protection of their Intellectual Property) is represented through Sora from Kingdom Hearts.

Smash Ultimate is the fastest smash game since Melee, as someone who has played countless hours of both, Melee is still faster when played at high level, however Ultimate is not Melee and nor should it be. Matches in Ultimate are a lot faster than that of Smash 4 or Brawl. Excessive Air-Dodging or Rolling is punished by the game mechanics itself. Directional Air Dodges are a big mechanical improvement over Smash 4. I never get bored of trying new things with new characters, there is so much hidden depth to this game. Despite this, Smash Ultimate remains more accessible than Melee or other fighting games such as Guilty Gear Strive. The game is very well balanced. There is a clear favourability to certain archetypes and characters in the game. Pikachu, Joker and Aegis are very clearly the best characters in the game, however Mid Tier characters can still cause upsets. There are still characters which are completely unviable such as Ganondorf who seems eternally doomed to be terrible in every Smash game, however it is not as bad as Smash 4 where the meta revolved around who could beat Bayonetta or Brawl where the same was true for Meta Knight. This is probably the most well balanced Smash game since Melee, like Melee there are several top characters who can counter each other as opposed to one extremely good pick which decimates everyone.

The only criticism I have for this game is that Nintendo probably spent £10 max on the Netcode for this game. In all fairness, if you are using LAN you are rarely going to get major disruptions but minor disruptions are common. Most online tournaments stipulate that you must be using LAN. If you and your opponent are using LAN you will have no problems at all. If you are using Wireless and venture into random matchmaking then all I can say is, good luck.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

I mean, the whole game is about the stages and items, not about fighting. Coming from other fighting games I miss the stable and balanced fighting system. We have some special moves that are kinda useless, broken combo system and a jumpy runaway type of fight where items give you the actual win most of the times, not your fighting skills",5,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
aNormalCritic,29-04-2022,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a very fun platform fighter and experience, with an extremely large cast of characters to choose from. From a casual point of view, it has a wide range of character designs and archetypes to play one that fits your personal playstyle, whether it is sniping with Samus, or chasing them down with fox, every experience is refreshing. From a hardcore player's point of view, the cast is balanced excellently and a 'bottom tier' character can beat a 'top tier' character, which allows for one to play a character that they like to try and win rather than the 'meta' character.

There are so many movement options for both casual and competitive players. A person who just picked up a controller can move around, dodge and counterattack relatively well, because the game allows for fluid movement, and while it isn't quite like SSBM level speed, it is quite nice. A competitive player can learn tech like B-reversing or wave bouncing and wave landing, or character-specific techniques to master the art of a character like Ryu for example.

My only problem with the game is the single-player campaign and online experience. If a person does not own a LAN adapter, the online matches run at very low frames per second, and input delay almost lasts more than a second at times, making matches frustrating. The campaign isn't all that bad, since there is strategy and kind of like a general RPG, collecting 'spirits' and characters and using them in battle, But it does get repetitive, and since Kirby is the only character available at the first, and much longer to unlock your favorite character, it might not be too fun.

Overall, solo play and playing with friends on this game is certainly worth it, and I would definitely recommend this game to anyone trying to get into the Fighting Game Community (FGC) or familiar with the Super Smash Bros. franchise, truly a must play.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

pros
(a bit contreversial) luigi is the best ever character he is SS Tier
so many characters and stages and music
better tips than sm4sh does
awesome training mode
(i know everyone will hate me for saying it) online isnt as bad when ur a casual and play arenas
the online doesnt look close to bad as brawls classic mode or smash tour cuz im CASUAL.
etc
Cons
lack of games and more gamemodes
(this is extremely controversial but im not putting online cuz im casual (who cares if mkleo is losing))
the fans (they are too toxic)

EmeraldBeans,07-08-2022,"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is my favorite entry in the series next to Brawl, but it diffidently has some problems as well. The amount of Fighters and different play styles you can dick around with is really large. I love how buttery smooth the controls feel while playing, particularly on characters like Inkling and Joker. Home-Run Contest is still the best mode in a video game, FIGHT ME. However the game gets a bit stale after you beat adventure mode, (Which feels quite boring and drawn out compared to the subspace emissary) and unlock all the characters. I found myself spending way too much time on the spirit board just waiting around so I could get the spirits I wanted, so I could summon more powerful spirits in order to add them to my collection. This felt like homework, not a game I paid $60 for. Trophies from the previous games have been completely gutted in favor for spirits, which are just simply PNG's of different artworks of charters and items of the different series represented. These don't have any description on who each of the spirits are (Which are really needed for the spirits, because I don't know how the hell half of these guys are), and exist for three reasons, 1. To stick onto your fighter during spirit battles to give yourself buffs, 2. To collect all of them and 3. To put less work into creating trophies. Spirits feel like they would be in a mobile game, not a crossover between Nintendo characters. Thankfully, like all the smash brothers games, the Multiplayer aspect is still really fun, and definitely why you should buy this game, in addition to that, the amount of new music, and music tracks in general is absolutely staggering. The newcomer fighters are definitely my favorite group in the series, but it kind of sucks that you have to buy the DLC to use half of them. I wish there were more options for online, but piss-poor online is one of Nintendo's specialists. In conclusion, this game is best for people who have multiple controllers and love to play co-op, but the single player modes kind of suck. But my favorite smash game is brawl, and I treat Home-Run Contest like a religion, so you probably shouldn't listen to my opinion. ¯_(ツ)_/¯",7,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

djreviews12,09-10-2022,"After the mess that was Super Smash Brothers on the 3DS, Nintendo fans have been hoping for a Smash Bros game that could reach the same heights that Smash Brothers Brawl once did. When this game was first announced, it showed some true promise. A new story mode, the return of every smash character? It was shaping up to be a great thing. But then the game dropped...

The story mode? What do I have to say, anybody who has played it knows how bad it is. Watching the grass grow in my front lawn is more fun and productive than playing Smash Ultimate story mode will ever be. But hey, maybe the competitive is fun?

No, in terms of competitive gameplay, it's a mess. With Super Smash Bros brawl, the game was very fair and balanced, and even gave new players a chance. The trip mechanic was a great equalizer for players, since no matter how good you were there was still a chance you might slip up. But in smash ultimate, all players know how to do is pick Steve, a new pay to win character. Yesterday I fought one such player online. He 3 stocked me and proceeded to use the Nintendo Switch Online app to call me poor because I do not own the DLC.

As the years have gone on on, developers have continued to turn a blind-eye to the fanbases' wants. The game is completely unbalanced, and they keep adding characters such as ""Steve,"" and ""Sora"" from unknown indie games that I don't think anybody has ever heard of before. Fan favorites such as Goku and Master Chief were completely neglected, and the competitive scene of this game is in complete shambles. Ultimately, this game falls completely short of all expectations, and we can only pray that a HD remaster of Super Smash Brothers Brawl comes out soon.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

A stupid kid with backpack that has literally has every piece of kit possible to have a counter for everyone. A puffball that can force a robot to snore and take a nap. A katana wielding anime swordsman whose attacks won't even do dang thing. You do the same recovery with a character and it will get you back to stage and then in the same match you'll do the same thing another time and it won't. Part of the roster has counters and the other half are just screwed. Some character hav way to heal themselves and others don't. Then there are random map features that will just appear on top K.O. you in the same frame. Then you have all of these maps and most are complete dog water. Short characters without moving will never get hit by F-air, N-air, and B-air. Shields for some people are so weak that can get jab twice and it's broken. Some characters have up smash that will pull you in forcing you into the damage. Getting out of sleep or shield break make no sense . Aww yes just mash all thee buttons. How about just one button rapidly. And many more. Please stop lying to yourself that this is a good game when it's not. Not even close.",0,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC

W1LD1FIRE,08-01-2023,"This game is by far one of, if not the best fighting game so far.

Nearly everything about this game is perfect. First of all, the gameplay. Moving and attacking is very fluent with its 60 FPS gameplay. Hitboxes are spot on, not to mention the roster. The stats of every fighter are very balanced with each other, to the point where you'll find yourself beating top tier characters with low tier characters.

Speaking of that, the roster is very expansive and interesting. Characters like Ridley, K Rool, Banjo & Kazooie, Sora, and more, all characters that have been requested for years, and have finally made it to this game. The overall roster is filled with many characters from several different franchises, which helps celebrate video games as a whole.

The visuals are good as well. The colors are just right - not as vibrant as Sm4sh, but also not as bleak as Brawl. Each character and stage is visually stunning, with detailed appearances on the characters and fun & interesting stages.

I don't really have much of a verdict on the online mode, but overall it seems pretty decent to me.

My ONLY problem with this game is the story mode. I think that World of Light is really fun, but I wish it more cinematic like the Subspace Emissary.

Other than that, this game is practically perfect. This game has set a new standard for fighting games, and has even inspired other games like Multiversus. This is a must buy for anyone with a Switch.",9,SUPER SMASH BROS ULTIMATE,METACRITIC
