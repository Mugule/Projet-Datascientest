Kefero,07-05-2021,"The game is visually alright. However, it is quite horrible compared to other Animal Crossing games. Not only this, but the fact that it is marketed as relaxing throws me off.

KC1994,21-03-2020,"It’s a fun game, very reminiscent of the old Animal Crossing games. HOWEVER, the inability for users of the same switch to have different islands isn’t cool. In fact, only the first player on the switch can complete assignments from Tom Nook and other characters. Not even a second copy of the game will rectify this. The only way to rectify it is to buy another switch. Nintendo is being VERY GREEDY in limiting the game play like this. And for that reason, I give this game a 4.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
timobeerke,23-03-2020,"To actually review this game I think you'll need two scores. The first score being the game when you are Citizen Representative (you booted up the game first) and the second score when you are an additional player.

I was unlucky enough to boot the game second and am not a Citizen Representative and to be honest I stopped playing the game after two days. You always have a feeling you have an inferior game where you are nothing more than a character on someone's island. You don't get to name the island, you don't get to build the structures on the island and you don't get to contribute to most of the ""story"" which Animal Crossing has to offer.

My brother who is the Citizen Representative enjoys the game and it is really polished and has a nice gameplay loop, but I feel ripped off. To me, this game deserves nothing more than a 1 out of 10, because I really cannot live with the fact that my game is limited. If you pay €60 for a game, you want to fully enjoy it. Now I just can't because of these restrictions.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Roachant,20-03-2020,"My wife and I were looking forward to playing this game when it released. I bought it, I let her play first she made an island and played for a bit. Then I decided to play only to discover that Nintendo only allows one island per switch! Not only that, the second player cannot build anything on the island and tool building is considerably harder to do. So, if you have more than one person in your home that wants to play the game, you need two switches. Worst decision I have ever seen, this even beats EA.

c_anthony,24-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great solo game that innovates and improves on most facets of the previous entries in the series and advertises that you can play with up to eight players on one island!
On the surface it sounds great, and it can be if you only want to play solo. This is a social game though, meant to be enjoyed by more than one person, and that experience is unfortunately ruined by some unbelievably poor design choices and limitations.
The only player who gets any real meaningful control over the island is the one who begins the game. They get to build villager's houses, place community buildings, etc. All players who come after them are treated like second-rate citizens, are given no control over virtually anything, and have a significantly diminished experience.
Through their failings, Nintendo has ruined what would have been an amazing experience for people to enjoy together. Unless you intend to play this game solo I suggest avoiding it.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Only 1 island is allowed to be created per Switch, and if another player on the same Switch wants to play, they'll be a glorified visitor on the island, unable to make any decisions for the island, being restricted to do essentially nothing but build their own home. The game either needs to make the option of making multiple islands or give everyone on an island the option to be in control.

Outryder86,20-03-2020,"I was very excited for this new installment of the Animal Crossing series. And I wish I could say that all the new bells and whistles and pretty graphics have made it the best ever. But Nintendo made the worst decision they could have possible made for this game.

You can only have one island per SWITCH. Not per user profile. Not per Cartridge. Per SWITCH.

This game is supposed to be Zen. It's not supposed to be the reason for a spike in domestic homicides. Having to share limited space with multiple family members competing for limited daily resources basically makes this game unplayable if, like a reasonable human, you only have one of these consoles in your family because they already have multiplayer support and you shouldn't need more than one for everyone to enjoy a game.

ProfessorFox,20-03-2020,BEWARE! If you have multiple people in your house that want to play this game they can not each have their own account (island). ONLY ONE customizable island can be played per Switch. Even if you buy two copies of the game you will still only be able to customize ONE island. I have 3 kids that want to play this game and they each want to customize their own island - AND THEY CANT! This is absolutely unacceptable. Maybe the dumbest thing Nintendo has ever done.

Player 2 can’t make any administrative decisions. Players 1 and 2 have to share limited daily resources. I had to delete my save so my brother could enjoy the game.

These factors contribute to an excellent amount of customisation and ensure that I will be playing for years to come.

I have two complaints with this new entry though. The first is the crafting mechanic.

Subby89,20-03-2020,It's 2020 and for some reason Nintendo has decided that only one island is available per Switch console. Meaning my fiancé cannot progress the game beyond what I have done since I started my game first. She cannot place buildings down. She cannot obtain better tools until I've done it myself. Why is she hamstrung? She has to have a lesser experience because of it. This is an utter joke and I expect my money back.

Thankfully my spouse asks for my input when placing houses, musuem, etc.. But then I realized he also gets access to diy recipes that I don't and that the island doesn't progress if he doesn't progress it. I can't contribute to the building off houses! We have no problems sharing resources. We have divided the island in half and have been sharing... But I feel like I'm getting a watered down version of the game. I don't think I should have to buy a whole other switch just so I cna have my own island! It seems ridiculous and unfair. I can't even imagine having a family with children who all want to play.

Things from the older games have been streamlined but it feels different enough to be a worthy sequel.

The fact that every other player - except the first person to boot up the game - cannot learn and perform more than 75% of the games functions is beyond UNACCEPTABLE. At this point Nintendo expects each switch console user to purchase their own switch with an additional animal crossing game if they want to play AC at the same register as the island ""resident representative"" LOL. This issue is clearly a money grabbing scheme and could easily be avoided by either 1) allowing everyone to be 'resident representative, or 2) Giving each player the OPTION to either join someone else's island on their switch OR create their own island. This function needs to be fixed as the game at this point is BROKEN, and is very disappointing for the following types of demographics: Couples who share a switch, siblings who share a switch, a parent and a child who want to play together, Roommates who all pitched in to buy a switch together.... you get my point.

Anyone else that joins the island cannot build and building, set any mandates, and cannot progress in the story (e.g. getting tools) until the owner of the island does. There are also restrictions on what the second player can put in the musuem. There is no reason for there not to be a second game file for each profile on the switch and Ninentdo attempt to push people to buy seperate consoles for this game is extremely greedy.

Nintendo got away with forcing us to buy one game per user for years and years with Pokemon and Animal Crossing, and now they want us to buy one CONSOLE per user.

But what's worse is a local coop, the second player is basically a slave of the main one without inventory and even being able to proper pick-up stuff (so you have to jump around the main player for usual exchange). Not to mention the second player animation every time it picks sth up from the ground (like ""hey I found this"") especially annoying when you have those quests like collect 200 sth. Also, the second player is unable to do anything while the first one is in the inventory menu.

3) Rather than create a co-op inventory system they opted to be lazy and limit it to the leader only. Other items are teleported to a shared inventory.

Giboultou,22-03-2020,"First of all I want to admit that yeah, it’s true single console multiplayer options are terrible. The second character gets dumbed down to a sort of follower that can only be in the shadow of the main player. Truth is tho that this feature has been true of New Leaf as well. If you wanted multiple villagers, the second wasn’t mayor and didn’t have as much freedom. So I would say that this isn’t a step back, but rather a lack of step forward from the developers on that front. However I don’t believe that this condemns all the amazing other features and steps forward. All furniture has been remodelled with great details, textures and lighting effects for a game with such a simplistic artistic direction. The museum is sublime, and the hourly music is memorable (for some). Animals now do lots of activities too and feel more alive than ever with witty and varied dialogue. Crafting is simple but well implemented, and it is a pleasure to slowly build the island into the little village the previous games had gotten us used to. I am ready to take off two points for the limitations created for families/friends with one console, though it does not concern me personally, but that does not entirely condemn it for all the wonderful things it has to offer and the great effort that was put into designing the game. It can’t be enjoyed by all, but for those that are planning to play solo, go for it, there is so much to get out of this experience!!",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Items are trapped behinds arbitrary walls put in place by Tom nook, in single player, that's frustrating, the resources needed for multiple people to achieve this kinda makes it somewhat miserable to play.

Honestly if this was any other game it would score much lower and i haven't even gotten into the multiplayer aspect both locally and online.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
mercurysmessage,20-03-2020,"An awesome Animal Crossing Experience. Being able to build out your island the way you like is an awesome feature. It's almost like having a crossover episode between Minecraft and Animal Crossing.

The only negative is the one Island per console. If we could have even one per User I would have given this game a higher score.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
AsrielDreemur,23-03-2020,"For those who are not familiar to the animal crossing franchise, Animal Crossing is a life stimulation game where you take your time to relax and explore your island as well as forming friendship with the villagers while doing outdoor activities such as bug catching and fishing.

As for New Horizons the game is just pleasant to play. The control feels right, there's more events to do, the atmosphere is much more lively and what's more with the addition of terraforming allows players to build new path or destroying the edge of a cliff in their island to how they see fits. Veterans of the animal crossing franchise fans will most likely appreciate all these new addition to the games.

The games does everything right in term of the gameplay but it does have some cons to it as well. Nintendo have set restriction where you only can have one island on a switch which means that you can't have multiple islands on the same console. It also restricted other profile users in your switch to perform activities in the island if you're not the owner of the island. Therefore New Horizon single player aspect is fun and all but if you're looking for a co-op experience this game does really poorly on that aspect.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

I hate the way my island looks and feels. I look to other player's 5-star islands and it is not my jam. I've ruined so much of the natural beauty of my secluded island to please Isabelle, but she's never satisfied. Can't even start a fresh island without deleting all my progress.

Almonds,18-05-2021,"I love Animal Crossing, but this game just feels like a let down.

Visually, this game looks FANTASTIC. There are so many small details that affect the world around you like the wind speed, how trees and other objects look in the rain, the sounds of different kinds of shoes walking across the ground, it’s great.

Terraforming is nice, putting furniture outside is cool, and crafting is a fun idea. I actually really love how this game starts out. I love that each day the island is growing, you get new items, and meet new characters as they slowly come to your island. But I feel like after this “tutorial” ends, I don’t really want to play anymore. In New Leaf your always building up stuff even after the beginning. I feel like New Horizons just stops in giving you major reasons to play the game.

Villagers are also a major issue. I never feel like actually interacting with a villager anymore. If I do I just mash the A button barely processing what the villager is saying because they’ve already said this exact thing a million times before. They just aren’t interesting to talk to. I also hate that when you give them items, they seemingly always accept it. This behavior just comes off as so fake to me that I don’t like it. Please just say “no, this isn’t my style” or something. Animals clearly have preference as sometimes they’ll wear the clothing you give them and other times they’ll wear it one time and just place it in there house the next day to never be used again.

I also find that furniture sets have less variety. So many items have been removed from New Leaf, it’s sad. Speaking of which, why did they completely cut gyroids from this game??? I thought before New Horizons that they would never remove Gyroids because they were in every single Animal Crossing game beforehand. But yet, here we are.

Also why is there only one shop upgrade? Seriously? And this can be done in like 1 month... Also why is Mable the only one to get a store, what about Kicks and Leif? Couldn’t they have been a similar thing to how Mable worked?

When this game can out, it was SUPER bare bones. Though this game was heavily reliant on updates for content... so okay I guess. Until you realize that most of the updates focus on some one day event that has already been in the previous Animal Crossings game. It’s disappointing how much new content were in these updates.

As many people have described New Horizons as a Happy Home Designer sequel. And that’s really what this game is. It focuses a lot on customization. But that’s not really my favorite feature. It’s the villagers. New Leaf didn’t really have the best villagers. I thought, “they can’t get any worse right? They can only get better.”

Well... guess my “hopes” were too high.

This game is fine on its own but Animal Crossing has been separating the main theme it started from, which is “family, friendship and community.”",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
becster95,28-04-2020,"I really like this game, but I think there is a lot of room for improvement I have played just about all of the AC titles at this point and this in my opinion is the second best (New Leaf first).
-There is a big lack of variety in dialogue with the villagers in the sense talking to them more than 2x per day gets them all mad and complain that the island is not big enough for the two of you.
-Not enough buildings. As of right now there are only 2 shops and all other NPC's only visit once in awhile on unpredictable schedules.
-What is the point of Isabelle announcements at the start of each day if she's not going to tell me when I have visitors like Sahara or Celeste just to name a few. I have defintely missed days with them on my island simply because I did not know they were here.
-Rugs sold from Sahara cannot be placed outdoors, why bother buying these if they can only be placed in my house when they would go PERFECTLY with the furniture I set up outside? Big opportunity missed there...
-Buying clothing from the Able Sisters shop is so time consuming, especially if I'm visiting someone else's island in the sense that I can only purchase one type of clothing at a time (ex buying the same shirt in multiple colors, I have to enter and exit the changing room several times). If there are other people waiting to use the single changing room available, it really slows everyone down.
-The crafting / DIY setup is really great, but I'd like to be able to craft multiple items at a time and have my in home work bench connect to what's in storage in home. Having all the materials in my pockets and trying to craft just takes up too much space (even with fully expanded inventory).

This seems like a long list of complaints, but the good really does outweigh the bad!",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
XV_,18-04-2020,"Once again I was allured to Animal Crossing more than ever, it was fun, it was great, but soon, slowly but truly its charm disappeared a fair amount.

I'm not a fan of review bombing, but I'm surely counting negative aspects that a lot of people are complaining about, if not for them, this review will be easily a 9 or so, but as it is, I believe a 7 is a fair score, without further ado my thoughts are as follows:

Starting with the positive things, NH is as ever an incredible time if you're up to the task of giving your heart to it, long gone are those days when you could only customize your house, now the full island has customization, and almost every furniture or item is placeable wherever you want, and it gives a lot of freedom and customization. As it was in New Leaf where you could make public structures, like arches or statues, now they're just items like it should have from a long time ago. Another good addition is its new point system called 'Nook Miles' in which you have to meet certain requirements like achievements and you'll be rewarded with miles, this system comes as unique achievements and a daily wheel of minor achievements that can be done over and over, in contrast with past entries where at a certain point you simply turn off the game because you didn't have more things to do for that day, these miles can be exchanged for several things like furniture, clothes or unique DIY recipes, this new mechanic in form of DIY is easily one of the most enjoyable things in NH, they come as gifts from villagers, message bottles, rewards, etc, the fun part is that you need certain items to make them, so a lot of your time will be invested in acquiring items to make your recipes, pure joy.

By far, the best thing that NH has to offer is terraforming, although it has its limitations, it's easily the most entertaining addition: do you want to make your island like a crater? maybe a fortress? or how about a city? the limit is your determination and creativity (and maybe at times money), but it surely is the thing that a lot of veterans were waiting, think of it as a Minecraft ripoff, but with Animal Crossing makeover.

As for the negatives, there are a lot of issues that can be resumed into 4 main problems, at least to me, they weren't a problem at first but everything went a little downhill once you notice them. First and the most common issue for everyone is the one island per switch, when the official trailer launched and stated that this game will be multiplayer with a common island I was really into, I and my partner were daydreaming about the things and possibilities of playing co-op, turns out that the local multiplayer is more a gimmick and the second player is basically a background PC, although the biggest issue is that the only the 1st resident can advance through the ""main quest"" so good luck if your 1st resident is not as active as you. The second issue is its online mode, if you're playing with one friend is just serviceable, but if you're going to play with two or more persons (friends or internet people) you'll notice that every single time a person arrives or leaves your island, every player that is in the island have to watch an unskippable (quite long) cutscene, not only that, for some unthinkable reason, you can't navigate through menus or inventory in that particular moment, otherwise, the cutscene will be delayed. this is a serious problem particularly if you're planning to play this with several friends or if you're into the stalk market, prepare to loose 15-20 min per arrival.

My third issue is more a quality of life issue, you see, Animal Crossing have ever being a game about of time, you have to wait a lot in order to have the best of it, but, at this point, selling, buying and navigating through menus is quite a burden, not only that, there are too many nitpicks to list in here, but, certainly it seems more like the game is keeping you away from having fun, is not like there aren't a lot of things to do, so it feels more like cheap padding than anything.

The last issue and the one that I hate the most and it seems that no one is talking about, is its ""free updates"", when the first official trailer launched with its terraforming promises, it also mentioned something that bothered me a lot, the fact its main events will arrive as free updates as if they need to be charged or something, in past entries these seasonal events wherein the main game, so it feels way too worrisome that now they're extra, if this game was a MMO or online specific, I wouldn't mind but, it's more like I paid full price for a game that is not finished, so if you're like me and want to play this game in some years, good luck finding those ""free updates"".

If you took your time to read this whole thing, I appreciate it a lot, even if you agree or not, I like this game a lot and have played 100 hours to this point but, is important to address its issues.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
ConsoleArgonaut,13-10-2020,"This opinion on the game is without including the new updates!

I hated this game for one reason: It absolutely wastes your time in every aspect of the game.
Why can't I craft multiple items of one type at once?
Why is the inventory so limited from the start?
Why are there always so many clicks you have to do for everything?
Also, Nintendo. Why can't I cloud save this game? I would like to uninstall it and come back to it later once there are quality of life updates, but I still have to have the icon on my switch no matter what? That just seems wrong.

Verdict: This game would be great with enough quality of life updates. As it stands tho it's a giant waste of time.

Rating:
Gameplay: 1/5 - Time wasting
Level Design: 4/5 - Great looking islands with nice exploration.
Soundtrack: 5/5 - Fantastic
Story: 2/5 - Everything this game needs, but nothing special
Graphics: 5/5 - Beautiful.
Length: 5/5 - As long as you want to. Played it for 30 hours and was still on the start of the game.
Replay Value: 2/5 - There's no real reason to start over again since you'll repeat everything just with other characters on your island.
Enjoyment: 1/5 - It just got frustrating the more I played.

djplanetb,12-09-2020,"Look, this is a very cute and diverting game. I got it when it came out even though I had never played another AC game before, though I have put many hours into Stardew Valley so I thought it would be a good fit. Then the pandemic came and I got into it especially at the beginning. Didn't even time travel until late May or so. I've bred all the varieties of flowers, collected all the fossils in the museum and just finished getting all the artwork too (I'm not some sucker that's going to not TT and wait 3 frigging years of real life to get all the art), terraformed my island several times over, so it's not like I don't appreciate what is in the game. The problem is the seeming hatred Nintendo's programmers have for the players of this game. Talking to Gulliver or Gullivarr, you literally have to hit the A button almost 20 times to get through the dialogues to get your task from them. This is similar for interactions with EVERY NPC that isn't an island villager. Why does Kicks even come to islands? He never sells anything worth having and that's just one more day until you can get some useful like Redd on the island. Crafting DIYs is a pain. I gave up crafing bait probably back in July, once I had caught all the fish available to that point. IF I ever pick up the game again (and it's less likely every day), I will never craft bait again OR terraform again. Terraforming is one island pixel/cell at a time. Like everything in this game, it is beyond tedious. This isn't so much a game as a part-time job and about as enjoyable after the shine wears off. I'm to the point where I cringe every time I hear the Isabelle music when starting up the game, then close my eyes and hit the A button until she's done saying nothing... again.

Back to the villagers... so boring. It's like you're supposed to talk to them every day, but when you do 9 times out of 10 they say the EXACT same thing they said yesterday. Reading online about how the villagers have been dumbed down and made nicer since the earlier games makes it seem like a really poor choice. When you get to the late game - having plenty of bells in your account and upgrading the house and shops to the max, and having the villagers you want - there's NO reason to go to other islands with Nook Miles Tickets. I now have about 150,000 NMs and NOTHING to spend them on. And I have a few achievements left to earn more but they are grindy AF and it would take me another 100 or 200 hours to get them (I'm ashamed to say I've played this over 500 hours, but I blame that on the pandemic). Not interested.

To sum up: It's a pretty game with no soul and in the end, will bore the cr*p out of you.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

Swerv,30-12-2020,"This is the first review I have written. Im not normally one to write reviews although I depend on them for all purchases. AC is not a bad game but while others find it enjoyable, I find it more of a chore with Nintendo forcing me to play the game the way they want.

1) One island per switch is annoying. This tied with the fact that only ONE person can do things like move / build bridges, stairs, & housing plots makes it extremely annoying when the island ""rep"" stops playing. Also, my partner & I have different tastes & playstyles. Forcing one island per switch was a terrible idea (but im sure they just wanted to force people to buy more Switches)

2) Load times are LONG. Breath of the wild, which is more intensive and large then this game, loads up in like half the time. One of the biggest reasons I dont play anymore, is because it just takes so long to get into the game and do the daily tasks.

The amount of dialog you have to sit through repeatedly + lack of bulk crafting added to the load times adds up.

3) Outside of events, the game is pretty stale. The amount of villagers keeps things interesting but after a week you heard all of Isabelle's basic greetings. Your person says the same cringy line EVERY TIME you find a fossil, catch a fish, ect.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

SatinFoil,01-01-2023,"When I first got this game back in March 2020, I got super addicted to this game! Really fun and if you have a switch, I recommend getting it! Especially if you haven't tried animal crossing games before, as if you get bored (you will see why I said that in a sec), you might be motivated to try the other animal crossing games! However, I started to get bord of playing after completing my island. And by that, I meant I didn't play it as much as before. I still played it really activly due to the active updates. (And I'm sure you see where this is going.) about a month or so after they released the 2.0 update aka the final update, I got bord and had nothing to modivate me to play it. Once that happend, I started playing new leaf (the previous animal crossing game) on my 3DS, and enjoyed that a lot more then new horizons (after the final update). Another pro to the 3DS version, is that you can buy more save files, aka, buy more animal crossing carts (as on 3DS, games you bought on retail have the save data stored on the cart, while new horizons the save data is stored on the system either way, I think), so that means, one save file per cart. You may wonder ""why don't you just delete your save data?"" Well, if you do that, shortly after, you will relize the mistake you made, and will get nostolgic for your oid town (in acnl its towns, not islands), so its worth the extra money. I'm going to stop now, because its becoming more of an acnl review more than an acnh review.

The NookPhone (and the whole “modernization” thing) and the sequel references, (because it would take place before them) and the most important thing: MORE STORYLINE!

(since it cost only $30) I had a New Nintendo 2DS XL for games like Mario Kart 7, Super Mario 3DS (The 3D one, I have the 2D one, too), Miitopia, and Tomodachi Life. I like the Tomodachi Life game, and it was similar, so what the heck, I gave Animal Crossing 3DS a try. I do not regret it, and find it to be the BEST decision I ever made. They had BUILDINGS! It had LIFE! I enjoyed 3DS, 10 TIMES BETTER, in the FIRST DAY, than Animal Crossing Switch ever did, in THREE DAYS! I may do a review on Animal Crossing 3DS in the future, but it's too early to decide yet. Heck, many critics reviewed the game too early! Why count any of the critics before the release date? I would give Animal Crossing Switch a 1, but I can't. I did not have any fun, except for the airport thing, which the train thing was a huge improvement over the Switch version, so I can't even give it a 1. I will give it a 4/100 (0.4/10), because it was playable, at the beginning.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Beep_Beep,25-03-2020,"Yes the decision to allow only one island per switch is silly, but that does not mean the game is an automatic 0. Animal Crossing was always like this anyway.

maniacalmermaid,29-03-2020,"This game is absolutely incredible! As a long-time fan of animal crossing, I have played every game since the GameCube. It is incredible to see how far the series has come! The graphics themselves have truly made the game franchise and villagers come to life! No detail left unnoticed, from the way the rain drops on the water to the way the wind sways in the trees. This game is truly a beautiful escape during such an unfortunate time in history. Even my husband who hasn’t been interested in previous games is hooked to this one. The crafting is addictive, and “Nook miles” objectives keep you playing for hours on end. This game is truly a masterpiece and I can tell there was a LOT of time spent on this game by the developers! Even the dialogue is simply fantastic. I haven’t seen such awesome dialog since the GameCube says. To all of those upset about the “one island per switch”, that is how every game has been except for the GameCube (one town per memory card). I don’t think it warrants a negative review whatsoever because it’s not a feature that has been taken away recently from the series. If that’s the case, where are the negative reviews for new leaf, city folk, and wild world?? My only small beef with the game (and why it’s 9/10) is that it is missing a large handful characters from previous games. Reese, Cyrus, Cappin’, Rover, Pelly, Porter, etc. are no where to be seen. If you are a long time fan of the series, you will definitely feel their lack of presence. There are new characters enrolled to fill the spots of some characters yet to make an appearance. However, hopefully with future updates they will return for an event or possibly dlc!",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Wojogat,10-05-2021,"The most abysmal game of the Nintendo Switch, if not, all of Nintendo's game consoles... ever. Abysmal is just one of the thousand words I have to say of this game. It is subpar, it sucks, it is unbelievable. I believe it's the worst game ever created in the history of mankind. This may sound extremely harsh, but to me, it is just 1% of what I feel about this game. This game is remotely awful. Plastic graphics that look more flat than a line, repetitive guitar music that sounds like it came from a cheap royalty-free music selection, repeating villager dialogue that just feels like they are on loop, and it never ends. I can't believe how atrocious this horrible game is. I cannot even express my anger to this insane game. If I were to continue, I'd start a whole rant here, so I'm just going to stop here. 0/100.

Zezuca,15-05-2020,"I'm generously giving this a 5/10, because the gameplay is full of flaws and ages terribly.

This title's multiplayer ""feature"" is complete and utter garbage. First off, every single time a new player joins, a lengthy cut-scene (about 40 seconds) will display to EVERYONE on the island. Also, no one is allowed to use Nookphones or have a dialog while a new player tries to connect. Then, comes the biggest issue: the game DOES NOT SAVE while another person is visiting your island. Imagine you've been playing with your friends for one hour or so, and suddenly your connection fails (even a second is enough). Every player will be disconnected and ALL the progress made by EVERYONE in the last hour will be COMPLETELY ERASED Even the host will lose all the progress. The game only saves at two moments, when in multiplayer: when a player leaves or when someone arrives on your island.

Then, there are the crafting mechanics. Poorly thought and limited, you cannot craft more than a single item at once. If someone needs 15 fish bait, the player will need to craft fish bait 15 times, go through the lengthy dialogues 15 times and endure the cut-scene 15 times. This issue is somewhat fixable by having a Turbo controller.

What can't be fixed is the lack of recipes. I've only got one recipe a day by opening the bottles that come ashore, and a random villager will also gift you a random recipe once a day. I have got duplicates on many occasions. And that's about it for obtaining new recipes. You'll need a thousand years to complete the recipe list.

This game has a ton of new fishes and different species. But to get them all for your museum, you'll need to travel using Nook Miles Tickets. While those aren't particularly expensive, there's only about 1% of chance of visiting an island with different fish or bugs. I'm 70 hour into the game and NEVER managed to travel to an interesting island. Most of the times, players'll get sent into a small island that has the exact same resources as the home island. So, if you think exploration is a forte in this game, rethink.

Then comes the arbitrary limitations: players are not allowed to send more than two letters a day, cannot purchase or view custom designs when someone is visiting, cannot terraform when online, trading or giving fish or bugs in any way is not possible. Redd will only sell a single piece of art a week (original or false). Terraforming is full of limitations, such as not building waterfalls in a diagonal or leveling the edges of an island.

Building mechanics are mediocre. The house interior is very customizable, and player designs are very well used in the game. But the lack of crafting recipes and the Nook store's 4 itens a day limitation will cripple your creativity. There are nearly no counters or tables to furniture the house.

Getting attached to villagers is also not recommended, as they'll randomly move away, even if you talk to them everyday and create friendship bonds, the'll eventually leave you. I like to think that each villager is a tickling bomb, when their internal timers reach zero, they'll vanish from my island and a new random'll take up their space . There's also no getting around to this.

So, the good things: the graphics are really cute, well made and unique. The music is also very good, the new mechanics (although sloppy and poorly thought) are a welcome addition to the series. There has been some good quality of life improvements, such as inventory space and item catalogues. But all in all, the problems of this game overcome the improvements. And they have added interesting new content via updates, although nothing was game-changing.

I can only recommend this to VERY enthusiast newcomers into the series that have never played sandbox videogames before, or to die-hard Animal Crossing fans that are willing to swallow its many problems while paying 60 dollars for a clearly unfinished game that lacks a lot of polishing. Even though, a warning for those people: like Pokémon, this game has NO CLOUD SAVING. If something happens to your console or the save data gets corrupted somehow, your island is done for. Users cannot manually backup the save, because it's stored inside the console (not on the gaming card, not on the SD Card memory).

I have played this for about 70 hours, but the frustration with the lack of polish and overall unfinished or pre-test project feeling this game has is too much for me to keep on playing. I now seriously consider selling the cartridge to get something else. This game is nowhere as polished as Breath of the Wild, and its quality is substandard for a console-seller title. A lot of people will hop into ACNH because of the hype and, like me, will be frustrated when they realize this game ages like milk.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

I think it's a great idea to only have 1 Island, but an update that all new Players have the same opportunities as the first Player would be nice

and you can play the game together as Family if your playing Co-Op... so if you can't play Co-Op TOGETHER then it's not even ""playing together as family"" then go buy your own Switch please...

Elmeromero,29-03-2020,"I haven’t played animal crossing since the game cube and all I remember was shaking trees, getting stung by bees and making my 10 year old dream house. The formula has changed surprisingly little but I have put in over 30 hours in just a week so you could say I’m addicted. I love the crafting and fishing. When I boot up the game I never have a plan but end up playing for hours. It sucks that you can’t have more than one island per console but my wife is fine to play a little here and there while I take main control so it doesn’t affect us as much but I do feel sorry for those players who want to have two islands on one console. I’ve really liked this game and would recommend it to anyone with a switch. For me, breath of the wild and Mario Odyssey are a perfect 10, smash is a 9, then I’d put Mario kart, Mario maker and Animal Crossing new horizon as an 8. Just as a point of reference, ya know?",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
RetroThunder,30-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the best video game in the series in terms of content and features. Something that I love in this game as always in the franchise, is the closeness it has with reality, now more than ever. Time, season (now even choosing in which hemisphere you can place your island) and weather equal to your city's. It also highlights how alive the game is, with dialogues from the neighbors that change continuously (not counting those of the main characters, which are very repetitive) and situations between them, that can make you feel as if you were really inside. Many people are annoyed that there is only one island per console, but not me personally, and that is one of the many characteristics that make the Animal Crossing saga unique. The union and trust between the players who live together in the same space. Despite this, I have to admit that multiplayer on the same console is somewhat messy, since it does not allow the second player to join the game directly and it has to go through a somewhat slow process. In addition to the fact that in order for him to do any minimum action, the first player must change his position as leader, and although it is a simple and fast process, it tires having to do it many times. Still, the control of the character and interface in singleplayer mode is not bad, because I really liked the idea of using a phone as a menu to navigate between the different options. Online mode is better than I expected and is an example of how multiplayer should be on the same console, although the transition between when the visitor arrives on the island and when he leaves can be repetitive when you connect many times with friends, but it is still pretty (somewhat long). As a conclusion, I can affirm that each new day on the island feels fresh and eager to start, although progress can feel slow but satisfactory. The new playable crafting and construction features can appeal to both veteran and new players alike, and graphically as well as musically it is very, very good. I am enjoying and having fun with this game and I hope to finish it completely because I liked it a lot, and it is not that it has exceeded my expectations because it was just what I expected but I do not regret buying it at all, it is highly recommended and I assure that those who play it will like it a lot.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
Rb_Drache,30-03-2020,"Not a perfect game, but definitely a great one.

Cons:
1. Online multiplayer waiting screen
You have to wait for 30~60 seconds every time someone visits or leaves your island. The waiting screen is kinda cute, but when you're playing with, let's say, 5 other people, you have to see that screen 10 times per session.

2. No bulk crafting/wonky inventory management
Animal crossing didn't have that many kinds of stackable items before New Horizons, and DS, 3DS, Wii version all had either touch screen or Wii remote which made pulling out items from the stack really fast and convenient, even if you can only remove 1 from the stack at a time. However, in NH you have to slowly remove an item from the stack each time, and the fact you can have 30 woods per stack (and even more for some items) doesn't help here. Also, the problem of slow, repetitive tasks is also in crafting, especially when you're crafting fish baits with manila clams.

3. No cloud save (yet)
I won't elaborate.

4. Game's progression is tied to the first player.
Can cause a huge pain if the first player stops playing this game. You should, at the very least, be able to change who's the boss among the players.

From here, I'll talk about the problem everyone is ranting about, but personally I didn't have a big problem with it.
5. Local multiplayer
The problem I have with the local multiplayer, is the fact second player don't have access to the tool wheel, and they somehow can't even hold an umbrella. You will have like 6 tools in your inventory and it takes ages to cycle through them. Also, the second player goes ""HEY I FOUND THIS"" like Link every time they collects an item, which takes too long if you're picking up several items, like when you're chopping or shaking a tree. Other than that, it's quite fun running around chopping trees and catching fish, wandering around with my sister.

6. One island per console
I understand everyone's frustration about this, but personally, I would like to share island with my family and renovate the island to a beautiful place, where our whole family worked together and have lovely memories about them. The lack of the choice isn't that good, so I'll put this as cons anyway.

Now, I won't write about Pros here, but it's overall much better than the last game I've played, which is the Wii version of animal crossing.

PSA: This game is NOT all about progression. The progression lies within how the island changes as you put efforts in it, building museum and upgrading resident service is only a part of it.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

When we found out a New Animal Crossing game was coming out, we were excited. We each had humble hopes. Ever since that 2019 announcement, I was dreaming of an amazing town to play in. But, when the trailer for New Horizons came out, our hopes were not as high. We were debating whether to get the game. We all agreed that we didn't like the whole NookPhone thing, but we still had hopes. We were excited March, but slowly but surely, it became worse. When April came along, so did Bunny Day. UGH! That was STUPID and didn't make me want to play the game! I started getting bored around mid-April, slowly but surely decreasing my rating. May was alright, and then we realized how repetitive it was. My friend didn't appreciate the game as we wanted it to be. As the months went by, everyone, including me started to not like the game. It became a bad game. It became so repetitive, we couldn't even play a minute. It's a waste now. Some new features are alright, but I can't give this any more than a 3/10. It's not a 0, we kind of enjoyed the game at first. Even the updates couldn't save the game... The updates are horrible and repetitive. They don't fix the game, and never will. No matter how many updates they release, it will never fix the game. As a long time Animal Crossing fan, I am disappointed. Many long-time Animal Crossing fans are disappointed in this game. Even people who don't play Animal Crossing will eventually find New Horizons repetitive. Whatever the case, I suggest people do not get the game. You may find it alright for a few hours, but after that, prepare to be disappointed. If you want to be introduced to Animal Crossing, we suggest an older game, but not the spin-offs. I think this should represent the issues that people think of this game. Oh, and the hourly music. Oh my... it's bland. It does not represent Animal Crossing music, and feels extremely bland, especially in the first month. It makes you want to turn off the music entirely. That's another issue I forgot to mention.

- Background music is repetitive.
- Interacting with villagers is repetitive.
- Local multiplayer is practically a scam.
- Online multiplayer is basically a middle finger to people with no friends that play the game. Matchmaking? Why bother developing such a feature when you can send people to Facebook to watch some ads.

GameDevsSuck,13-06-2020,"At its most basic, it succeeds as an AC game. If you’re looking for something new in the AC franchise this will entertain you without issue if you play sporadically. Spend a good amount of time with it and you will see how careless and thoughtless some of the design decisions are. Crafting seems to have been added as an afterthought because it polled well with focus groups. Building your own tools fits the theme of beginning life again on a new island, but after it loses its novelty, its just a VERY basic durability system that doesn’t show any gradual degradation. Your perfect-looking net or axe just vanishes with a poof after enough uses. It tries to encourage a loop of gathering and crafting, but crafting more than one or two things at a time is so tedious I’d often find myself pulling up a different screen to look at. I’m not saying the system doesn’t belong in the game, but the combination of ‘only random’ (still multiple duplicates or recipes from the recipe kits available at the very start of the game) recipe acquisition, clunky crafting UI, and literally no form of progression makes me wonder how much more robust this kind of system could be in 2020.

The biggest killer for me was the villager system. If someone moves out you get a vacant lot in their place. It will randomly fill after some random number of days. This feels like someone else making villager choices for you while you accidentally left your switch unattended. I think this is so you will feel pressured into buying Amiibos to help replace villagers you did not invite to your island. Having them move out on their own can take WEEKS (This system is what made me want to leave this review).

Many of the systems in place to add a sense of a dynamic town begin to feel punishing. Random vendors/NPC visit the island but are limited to one visit per week. Take a day off from playing when the ones making collectibles of the things you caught happen to be visiting? Better luck next week! There are a lot of QoL issues that become infuriating after you spend enough time with the game. So many buttons go unused in menus and elsewhere. Buying items requires you to get them one or five at a time, clicking through multiple screens of unskippable text each time for the privilege. It just seems like they ran out of time making all the items and focusing on visual appeal (It’s great!) and had to sacrifice having a deep look at the big flaws in this iteration. This game will be worth buying when it’s been out for a few major overhauls. They’ll focus on seasonal events and patching out exploits in between DLC releases. My prediction is they will never make any attempt at addressing the ‘minor’ issues outlined here because they don’t break the game, they just make it more frustrating to play.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

NeveSucks,18-07-2020,"I truly wish I could say I enjoyed this game. I played it as the first person on the console so I was able to get the full experience. I sunk 50 hours into it, but I’m sad to say I disliked almost all of that time.

It’s an easy game to get lost in, I’ll give it that, but after the first few tasks of the game when you are finally given free roam, it’s boring. Absolutely nothing compared to the refreshing experience that was New Leaf.

It may appeal to some, but personally, filling an island with objects that are unusable to achieve a 5 star rating is not what I expected from an Animal Crossing game. Dialogue with the characters on your island is short and lifeless. It’s tedious to get actual tasks out of them. Terraforming seems fun to begin with, but soon becomes a chore when trying to create the ‘perfect’ island. Furniture cannot be interacted with, so once something is placed, that’s the end of the fun. Filling the museum is enjoyable, but that’s the most action the game has. You’re basically turning your island into a museum anyway.

Travelling to randomly generated islands feels repetitive, and the only redeeming quality of them is finding a rare bug or a cute villager. I expected something amazing compared to New Leaf (which is my favourite Animal Crossing game), but New Horizons fell short.

schloobysclerm,26-03-2021,"This game and what is behind it is honestly appalling. Of course there's the one-island-per-console thing, which is terrible, but the game itself is just not what the Animal Crossing series is supposed to represent. The villagers have been completely sidelined and now do nothing to contribute to the game, repeating the same happy-go-lucky lines over and over. What happened to the sass? The gossip? And what happened to being part of a community? Now the main focus is showing off your island, but the game can't even do that right because of the horrible quality of life, such as the aforementioned island limitation as well as every minute task taking forever to do. Post-launch support has been revolting, and a year later this game still lacks most of the content of the previous titles. The developers refuse to listen to any gripes players may have, and do the bare minimum to constitute the game being $60, because they don't have to care because of how well this game sold.

There are only two things I take issue with though-- crafting can be incredibly tedious and it needs a few changes (allow us to craft multiple items at once, skip the low-grade tools if we have the necessary materials for better ones). Secondly, I think allowing players to join you on mystery island expeditions would make the game even more enjoyable.

They sold it under the promise that there would be meaningful updates which they have failed to deliver on. The only content updates were parts of the game that were not quite complete when the game released such as diving or the museum/ artwork, but it was obvious they were supposed to be in the game as people could glitch into the water to swim and the spot for Redd to show up was already there. What the hell did they do with the extra six months they took after the first release date before actually releasing? Meanwhile they add a few clothing/ furniture items every month and boldly call it a ""free update"". Where's the coffee shop, shampoodle, fortune teller, GYROIDS FFS, store upgrades, shoe shop, gracies, mini games, etc etc etc. If it wasn't severely time gated then the main story would have been done in a day if that.

So if i'm playing this game and my younger sister wants to play it too, she has to buy ANOTHER switch if she wants her own island.

Average_user,30-03-2020,"Hi, as a 14 year old with two siblings I have a few problems with this game. I have been so hyped for this beautiful game! So when I heard my mum had let us get the game for being good during her stay at the hospital, I was ecstatic! This game is £49.99 and it is worth every penny. It is stunning. The best looking animal crossing game ever. Once downloaded, my brother let me watch him I was so excited seeing him play and I was dying to make my own island. However, I soon realised I couldn't do that. There is a limit of one island to a console. Now I understand the reason. It is a great business technique but it is just unfair. My mum was barely able to afford the one we have now and me and my siblings will not be able to share the one island. It'll cause too much frustration. Resource limitation and progression differentiation is irritating to say the least. Me and my sister won't have the same choices and things that my brother will get because he is the representative. I love animal crossing because it's a chill game. I can take my time and do what I want on my own file. But this makes it impossible to have as much fun as I'd have on New Leaf. I seriously just want to give up and let my brother have his fun and it breaks my heart. In this current time with this pandemic I just wanna go to a deserted island and forget what's is going on since I can't see my friends. But this limitation will tear me and my siblings apart which is not what we need.
I don't want to drag this game because it doesn't deserve that. It has been amazingly developed and it has so many positives! I wish I could give it 10/10 but I can't. This one island per console is too unfair and too expensive. This game is advertised for families with kids and most kids will have siblings who will also want to play the game and that is not including the parents. Now, I don't know about you but my family can't afford 4 switches. I hope Nintendo fix this so I can give it the 10/10 it deserves!",7,ACNH,METACRITIC

The angry point is that Nintendo says u can play with 3 players in local multiplayer but it's FAKE ! It's not really a multiplayer game !

Blayz,06-04-2020,"I’ve literally never been so disappointed in a while. The first and probably most obvious problem that a lot of other people are talking about is the 1st player priority and 1 town per switch. Put it simply, AC is a terrible shared console game (I can say that for literally most of the AC games). Not much of an issue for the last game because it was on the 3ds and people usually got their own 3ds (and even then, I’d argue it was still a better shared console game). It’s even worse in NH because it treats the 1st player special and all the other players are just useless (they can still destroy **** so gl sharing with someone younger). No backup save, no transfer, no alternative way of getting a different town other than giving Nintendo more of your money during a time like this where we’d all rather save it. Of course there are more reasons to hate this game that has nothing to do with the multiplayer based reasons. Remember ordinances? Gone. Swimming? Gone. Coffee shop? Gone. Completely different areas with unique themes that were really useful? Kinda but not as good as before. Perfect fruits? Gone. Reliable tools? Gone. ‘But tools breaking tools adds challenge!’ Challenge as in being obnoxious? Remember this mechanic in BotW? It worked there because 1. I don’t have to go through the same obnoxious crafting cutscene to make one again and 2. The breaking tools actually encouraged conservation and different strategies to fighting, meanwhile in this game, it’s just a strain on your already limited resources that you get once per day (the survival/resource-scavenging thing doesn’t fit AC at all). When you break your fishing rod, there’s no alternative choice than to build another one. Also **** eggs.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

Why can't I select multiple items in my inventory and choose to send them all to storage? Why can I access Nook Phone while sitting but not my inventory? Why can't we sit on the ground next to villagers? Why aren't we allowed to meet villagers on mystery islands when we have full residence on Island? Why can't we choose to buy multiple of items through the terminal (It's a pain to buy a Nook Miles Ticket, wait for it to print out, choose to purchase more ONE AT A TIME.)

Why can't we move buildings over by just a tile or two?( I've had to move a house/store somewhere else completely to then move it back to it's original location, just 2 spaces to the left). Why is there NOTHING to do with friends in this game? Where are the island minigames like in New Leaf?

Why can't we ride the carnival rocking horsies like we've seen in footage leading up to the release? Why does Nook's Cranny take SO long to upgrade?

And with QoL (Quality of Life) improvements, like the ability to expand your inventory and having resources automatically stack, I can’t help but recommend anyone who has a Switch to buy this game.

The only thing that stops me from giving a 10 is sadly the same-switch multiplayer, and the concept of it in its entirety. Having multiple villagers on one island, only one can experience the full game, but also stops others from getting further. This gives other players the feeling that they are missing 20% of the experience. From an other players’ perspective, this isn’t great, and the only thing that would make me happy is to just give each player an option to either join an existing island, or create a new one.

The coop is just the tip of the iceberg though. Nintendo is so authoritarian now that they want to control everything you do in their games. The time it takes to do anything in this game is comparable to a mobile game like clash of clans. I'm honestly surprised that there aren't gems you can buy to speed things up.

coreygeier,01-04-2020,"Giving a zero star review because I've never played this game. I own a Switch console with my roommates. I was thinking about buying New Horizons, but my roommate bought it first and started a file. I sat down to start my own file and then we realized the game's terrible multiplayer situation. She didn't exactly want me to play on her file, and I didn't want to have to intrude on her game. Furthermore, I want to have the whole experience of the game as someone who has never played an Animal Crossing game before. There is nothing I can do to have my own file except to buy an entire new console and game. Somehow, I don't think Animal Crossing: New Horizons will be worth a $360 price tag.
It's completely ridiculous that Breath of the Wild, a massive open world game that takes up 14G of storage and is one of the most popular releases for the system (as well as every other game) was able to find a way to allow for multiple save files for different users but Animal Crossing couldn't? We talked to Nintendo's support about the problem and they mentioned that the single file system was to maintain the game's ""artistic integrity."" Well, Nintendo, thanks to all that integrity, I can't play this game. I hope they release an update to fix the save file issue because I really would like to experience this game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

One island per switch is a dreadful decision. What about a typical family with a couple of kids who can only afford one console and share? Absolutely wrecked this game for a lot of people, unless of course you're player 1, then I am sure you'll have a great time.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

I am required to share an island with my 8 year old sister who takes all of the resources and messes with my house on the daily.

gun661,20-04-2020,"""#1 Best Switch Game of 2020"". Catch 10.000 fish in a minigame that requires 2 A-button presses, catch 10.000 bugs in a minigame that requires 1 A-button press, chop 10.000 wood, mine 10.000 ore, dig for 10.000 fossils, and pop 10.000 balloons/lootboxes for rare pieces of furniture. Click through the same repeating speech bubbles when interacting with your NPC villagers. Later in Animal Crossing: New Horizons you can also edit the layout of your 3D-level, piece by piece. One of the ""best games of 2020"" is a cumbersome 3D-level-editor in which you have to do busy work to gather randomly appearing 3D models of furniture, dress up your character, and outfit an empty museum which probably no one but yourself will visit. This whole ""game"" is like outfitting an empty museum which will never be visited by many interested visitors. That's about it, that is the extent of interaction this game provides - for the ""multiplayer"" part see almost every other review. The only feature that made me play this game 5 minutes a day for several days is the ""skinner box"", i.e. the variable rewards, i.e. the chance that maybe a rare piece of furniture appears in one of the balloons/lootboxes or in one of the ingame stores. But after you've placed your rare piece of furniture and after you've equipped your new fancy hat, there's just nothing much to do but grinding and looking at good looking 3D items.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

She hasn't really taken to it yet so I've launched it on my Switch and am on my way to customising my own Island which i'm finding a lot of fun. This is my first ever experience of an Animal Crossing game and I think the perfect place to start as you go from barren unpopulated island to building a full community - I've never been into games like this but it is really addictive!

Note: I'm fortunate in that I have my own original Switch and my girlfriend has the Switch Lite so the 1 island per console rule isn't hindering either of us.

Because you can't craft multiple, the time to craft craft things like fish bait is increased to an unacceptable amount. Using fish bait as an example you need to 1. Go to bench and select craft something. 2. Select the recipe you want to craft 3. See a cute animation for crafting 4. Have your character exclaim they made the thing you told them to and 5. select craft something else. Repeat as many times as you plan to craft, and this game is getting 10's? Its good but no 10.

swavmirj,15-04-2020,"TL;DR: This game locks out anyone wanting to share a console with a household by removing core game functions (story progression, infrastructure tools) to players 2 to 8, and only allows for complete collection of elements if players engage in local co-op with other game owenrs or they subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online (see below for details).

4.5 out of 10 seems a fair score to give a game that put in a huge amount of effort to create a beautiful, well executed, addictive game that alienates half its player base. For each player in a household to have the full experience, you would need to spend $408AUD per person ($79 for a copy of the game, $329 for a Nintendo Switch Lite). Safe to say, no game is worth $408.

Here are some of the features that players 2 to 8 on a single game miss out on: Story elements, bundles of free recipes, and island editing tools (infrastructure projects, moving buildings/houses, terraforming).
This would be the equivalent of BotW only allowing the first person to boot the game to fight the Divine Beasts and Fight Ganon, but allowing all other players to collect hearts, stamina, and resources for player one.
Or, it would be the same as only allowing the first player to boot up Super Mario Odyssey to collect moons, while every other player could only collect coins.

Furthermore, none of the promotional materials, nor any reviews of the game have indicated that collecting all the materials within the game is capped for anyone looking for a purely single player experience. As an example, a single console and island has access to a maximum of half the fruit species available unless they engage in local co-op with another owner of the game, or subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online. Datamining revealed that players visiting Mystery Islands will only be exposed to their Native Fruit, and a ""Sister Fruit"". No matter how many Mystery Islands you visit, these will be the only two fruits you'll be exposed to.

The shady nature of the promotions around collecting, combined with the lack of autonomy given to all players beyond player one, is why this game is getting slammed by players. That is why such a beautiful game, with addictive gameplay, does not deserve the full praise it deserves, when it is so clearly trying to force people into purchasing multiple copies and consoles to fulfil the experience.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
iMustang,03-04-2020,"This was my first time diving into this cherished franchise and I must say all my hype and excitement was very much matched. The atmosphere of this game feels exactly like a vacation, a place you can get away and enjoy life however you want. Catching fish, planting flowers, visiting new places, a museum, and shopping, all while meeting adorable animal friends along the way. The sheer amount of stuff you can do in this game is insane, to a point that a completionist like me wonders if you can really do it all, not that it'll stop me from trying! Then the social element with friends makes the experience even better, as the communication with hunting bugs and fish, different stuff to craft, or even the ""stalk market"" all make you feel like you're apart of something larger as a whole (even lager than the feeling of your own island community gives you). That's exactly the feeling the developers want you to have with this franchise, and it certainly resonates within each and every one of us. And even simplified, visiting islands and showing off your own is just fun! (So long as everyone plays nice)

This was a time in my life when this game was exactly needed, and has brought me so much joy and peace. I know I'll be playing this game for months and years to come, and even when the next Animal Crossing game comes out, New Horizons will always hold a special place in my heart for being my entry into this beautiful series.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Millet,30-03-2020,"If rate this game a 7.5 but going with 8 because of so many unfair reviews here. My critiques:
1) There are less fruit & shop varieties than NL. I wish nooks could be upgraded past a shed in this game.
2) storage system could really be optimized in several ways-at least as an ""unlock"" feature. Could use a lot more storage space overall. But things like letting work benches store materials, or having ways to access storage outside of your home would be great quality of life features that don't exist right now.
3) wish the map had a villager & visitor key/tracker since the island is (nicely!) Big. Hard to find anyone tho.
4)I miss being able to unlock services to hire people to water plants and deweed for me in the end game. I miss the being able to select building projects and have villagers occasionally help submit bells for the cause.
5) NL had games you could play with your villagers randomly and have events where they'd either invite you over or request to hang out with you in your home..I have many hours in and haven't seen this. (They'd also be willing to part with furniture and such)

To be clear, ACNH *added* many features but also took away some that I enjoyed. The #1 issue with this game is you can only have one island per switch ...youd have to buy an entirely different system if you have more than one person who wants to play their own file. I don't see this restriction on any other switch game I own so this feels very dissapointing as a decision even if it doesn't apply to my household situation. The switch system is pricey and families probably were caught off guard by this.

Savarunl,07-04-2020,"The game is great in some aspects, and really bad in some others/
What i really like in the game:
- The detail of everything in the game
- The, mostly, well written dialogues
- The relaxing vibe of the game

What i dislike in the game:
- Having the same dialogue every time for basic functions (this is also the rare case where the dialogues are not well written, surprisingly) like selling things or turning something in to the museum
- Being allowed only one island per Switch
- The apparent randomness of some things like stacking items (some stack to 99, some to 10, some don't stack at all, etc.)

What really grinds my gears in the ame:
- The horrendous multiplayer. Clicking through 8 dialogues, watching an obnoxious cutscene that also plays for ALL other players in the island you go to and not being able to do basic things when your island is open for other players.
- The speed at which tools breaks, even the improved ones. Making tools over and over and over get's RALLY tedious after a while.
- The placing of items outside your house is absolutely terrible, where you have to hope that you 'aimed' correctly. This get's more apparent when you want to move, for example, a house, and you misplace it by 1-2 tiles, after which you have to pay to move it again.

All in all, i have some enjoyment at times in the game, but the mentioned issues really keep me from enjoying the game to the fullest. If some those points would be improved upon, this game would be magnificent, but for now i can not give it more than a 6/10.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

There are so many little details that make my heart sing like rain on windows, breeze in trees, and such elaborate shadowing and lighting. I recommend this game to everyone. Everyone should play animal crossing, young and old. It brings people together and helps you unwind when you’re feeling stressed. Its also not to get addicted to such a beautiful game.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Andydoo,19-04-2020,"This is, overall, a really great experience. I can say in full confidence that you will like this game. Even if you think you won't; in fact, this game probably has the most positive impact on people who don't think they'll like it. From the perspective of someone who's played every game in the series since the DS, I can also vouch for this one is easily the best.

Aside from some minor inconveniences and one really major inconvenience I'll get to in a minute, this game's new ideas shine. There's a lot of quality-of-life changes, but in typical Animal Crossing fashion, it's still kinda bad. For example, you don't have to worry about waiting for furniture to show up in the store because you can craft them as many times as you want whenever you want, so long as you have the materials to do so. But you can't craft the same thing in bulk, so if you have 19 manilla clams, you're gonna have to wait through 19 animations and select the options 19 times. It's not a huge deal, but it's a bummer. It's still not easy to time-travel, which I understand makes me automatically the worst person on Earth and the bane of some Tumblr users' existence, but it really should be made much easier to allow people to play the game the way they want to play it. Especially since the solution to not being able to sell things after the stores close is... not good. It's bad. It sucks. You just have to wait until the shop opens to get 80% of the bells you would've made if you'd just waited until the morning to hand it to the shop owners directly, so it completely misses the point. But again, it's really not that big a deal.

That stuff holds it back from a perfect 10 out of 10, but the good absolutely outweighs the bad here. I've told this to each of my friends individually, and I'll say it again: buy this game. Do it.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

The fact that the progress of second-and-additional players is limited by the progress of the first player is a showstopper for this game ever becoming a classic. The Switch offers multiple separate user profiles so that games can be, well, separate. The forced sharing of an island and the fact that the island rep gets game features that the other players don't get ruins the experience for any family/roommates//etc. that are using the same console. The option to share an island should be just that: an option. If in my own profile I want my own island with my own game experience, that should be possible.

RadioReviews,25-04-2020,"I grew up with animal crossing, from Wild World to New Leaf I couldn’t miss out on New Horizons. I played the game the day it released and it’s become part of my daily schedule ever since then. The game offers a peaceful getaway from the stress of the real world and allows you to turn a deserted island into your own personal paradise. Like Minecraft once said “the only limit is your creativity” and that fits perfectly for this game. Almost unlimited design options from planting flowers to terraforming mountains and waterfalls allows players to practically play god and do whatever their heart desires. The start of the game is a bit slow and tedious as players try to get all the buildings and upgrades so you can do as you will. The core part of the game is building a community with these adorable animals that will populate your town that have their own personalities and preferences. Featuring many popular returning faces including Tom nook, Timmy and Tommy, Isabelle, able sisters, Leif and many more you are bound to reunite with your childhood favorites. Collecting different rare fish, bugs, and fossils is a main component of the game and can be, annoying, at times but makes you feel accomplished apon collection. Multiplayer is something I use frequently in the game and I’ve discovered it to be, boring. No mini games, annoying communication, and limited interaction forces players to come up with their own things to do (or just awkwardly stand next to each other and doing emotes). Multiplayer is good for trading but that’s honestly about it from what I’ve personally experienced. In a game where you can do almost anything there is something for everyone here and can bring some peace to even the rowdiest of souls. With no violence, swears, drugs, or sexual references this is almost a “shell shock” being seen as one of the best selling games of the year so far. This game allows me to stress out about where to put my flowers instead of stressing out about deadlines and drama and is a nice feeling that only this game can deliver. I can see this being part of my daily schedule for months to come and I always look forward to what new exciting thing will happen on my island each day.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Wobs,07-05-2020,"Perhaps i am being to harsh on the game and went in with high expectations. I have never played an Animal crossing game up to this point but i played stardew valley and thought it was pretty great. While playing it i would get onto web forums and that is where i heard a lot about animal crossing and how it was the game that started these types of games. Some people would even say they were playing stardew valley while waiting for the coveted animal crossing new horizons game. I got into the hype and i felt like Nintendo was on a role with their in house games so i pre-ordered it for me and my wife.

Here is the reasons why i am disappointed with the game.

1. All the profiles on a switch play on the same island. At first this sounded interesting and it felt like our house would have its own community. What makes this annoying is that you are on an island with finite daily resources so if my wife plays before me she could take most of the resources on our island. Granted I could spend nook miles to go to a random island to get resources but it was really disappointing searching the island for leftovers.

2. This First person to play the game can impact the progression of everyone else playing. This person becomes the island representative and they get assigned objectives that lead to the islands growth. I let my wife play first and I found my self waiting her to build some buildings and could not participate the same way. My profile can only do the side objectives. It felt like the idea of there being two people playing the game on one the same switch was an after thought. Or a greedy money grabbing attempt from Nintendo.

3. Most craftable items are just decorative. In games like the sims, minecraft, and Stardew Valley you had decorative items but also a lot of items the are functional. Like a stove to cook food or a bike to make you travel faster. In animal crossing I made a bike and a stove and they just sit there and I can't use them. It makes crafting kind of boring because you don't create something useful. I have an interior design app on my phone and it feels kind of like animal crossing.

4. Social media seems to be a big part of this game. One of the cool things about this game is that your island is unique and what grows on your island does not nessarly grow on a friends island. For example Apples grew on my island and peaches grew on my sisters island. In order to get different resources you either need to get extremely lucky and find them on a mysterious island or trade with a friend. If someone is your friend on the switch you still have to friend them in animal crossing. It is independent of your switch friends. The best way to trade is to get on social media or forums. This would not be so annoying if switch had a mic built into the console. Instead I found myself having to type everything out. What made it more annoying is that my wife (the island rep) did not have switch online for her account. So the person who had the most important role could not do online trading. If you are going to force us to share an island then this island should have a shared subscription. I started getting bored because i was not the representative but my account was online so i had to do the trades.

5.Multiplayer is not that fun. Couch co -op is in the game, but to play it you need to have a profile and a character made on the island . For couch co-op the second player is forced to follow the first player and can not keep any resources. In Online multiplayer you can't do things like move decorations while someone is visiting your island. Online players can keep the resources they take from your island.

6.Lack of goals. It wants to be like minecraft in this aspect and wants you to choose your own path. Minecraft is massive with so much to explore and learn about, animal crossing is small and most island feel the same. Stardew Valley is also small but you can explore with crafting and i remember gathering resources just to see what a crafted item does. In animal crossing the most exciting things are a new visitor, a large fish shadow, or a bug that can attack you. It just does not have enough different things for me to do or learn about to care or get lost in.

7.NPC relationships do not really feel like they progress. I don't feel like my npc's see me more as a friend than when they first came. Npcs with the same personality they start to get repetitive in conversations. Don't get me wrong there are some interesting things that they do but it seems few and far between.

8. The real time can be annoying when joined with the problems above. Basically i play the game at night after my wife and the nook shop closes. You can put stuff in a box to sell but you get penalized and lose 20%. It is annoying because when you start the game the shop is open 24/7. If you work late you might be inconvenience by this game.

Overall it feels like a grind for both me and my wife.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
CherryPie,11-05-2020,"My sibling and I bought the Animal Crossing Special Edition switch consoles just to play Animal Crossing. We knew we had to share an Island, so I was the second player and played for a few hours until I realized that the first player gets to do everything and experience events, while the second player has no decisions on the island and is inferior. As I don't see any point in playing with an inferior character, I just deleted my character and let my sibling play the game on their own. If they allowed the second player to have the same responsibilities as the first player or allowed 1 island per game cartridge, I would have bought another game cartridge to play (which would also be a profile for Nintendo), but no, Nintendo wants us to buy separate consoles. Nintendo is very money hungry. I have the money and can buy my own switch, but I refuse to support such greedy actions as there are other families that can't afford to buy a switch for each child.

This is a game that wants to frustrate you to the point that you will go out and spend an additional 360$ for a new Switch and another copy of animal crossing. Not only is the one island representative bad enough. Couple that with extremely limited couch co op where second player doesn’t have access to do anything other than chop trees and watch logs Poof to the recycle bin. Made miserable by the fact that you have to leader swap and go nick them up if you actually want to retrieve them. I’m sorry but until this is fixed in my opinion this game is absolute trash and have no desire to play. Bought this title to play with my wife and daughter.

ZippyR,12-05-2020,"I really wish I could give this a better review. If the save system was like any other game where multiple users could have their own island, then it would be a 9. But forcing people to share islands is disappointing to say the least. Instead of being able to collect resources like every one else, you’re forced to compete for resources, thereby slowing everyone’s progress. Additionally, unless you’re the person to create the island you’re treated as a second class citizen who doesn’t get to help out with any of the projects that progress the island. At one point you have to build furniture and decorations for 3 villagers, but only the Resident Representative can see what’s needed, let alone turn them in. You can work together to build the items and give them to the RR, but that’s more cumbersome than it should be.

If my daughter hadn’t used her allowance to buy a digital copy then I’d look into returning it. But she’s 7, and loves the game, so I wouldn’t do that to her even if it was possible to return digital copies of games.

Nonetheless when I came downstairs I was so excited to do the same, but then I noticed something odd, I didn’t get to create my own island.

It’s very pretty, fancy, and oh-so- Minecraft???? Customization is great but these NPCs (a large part of what made the older games so fun) have no soul. I’m sure marketing made a great pitch for online play and yadda-yadda but how no one brought up the fact that this game is primarily going to pique the attention of a niche audience who has been waiting for years and who did not go ga-ga for online play (mostly because it largely didn’t exist on this platform) is also baffling.

Not knowing this, I spent a lot of time thinking there was a major bug in the game. When I found out it was a feature, I was surprised and not in a good way.

It's not likely it's because of a Switch technical limitation, as the Switch is able to maintain separate save files for every profile for just about every other game, including games more complex than Animal Crossing.

kuehnau,14-05-2020,"It's Animal Crossing. It's always been Animal Crossing. And while they add some quality of life improvements to the game and some more polish, it's still pretty much the same game you've played since the DS era.

And the game still suffers from it's biggest drawback. Animal Crossing is a game that has no direction, it's about you personally finding stuff to do. And unfortunately, everything there is to do is the same mundane schlock you've come to expect from every other previous iteration of the game.

The ""mystery islands"" could have been a nice touch, but they are a quarter of the size of the normal island. Islands are picks from a small selection of pre-made islands instead of being procedurally generated. So instead of constantly finding new islands, after a weeks worth of playing the game, you'll begin to constantly see the same island types over and over again.

The developers made an attempt to give you more to do, but it ends up boiling down to being rewarded for doing the same stuff you have always done instead, while locking rewards behind ""Nook Miles"", a secondary form of currency in the game. The end result is, they've managed to already take a core mechanic from the game and turn it in to even more of a grind than it was before.

Animal Crossing's popularity isn't surprising; it was simply a coincidence, it managed to be released around the same time a massive pandemic was taking place. If it weren't for that, I doubt it would be getting such high accolades from people, because at the end of the day, this version is just as mediocre as any of the other releases.

Not a game for everyone
New Horizons is my first animal crossing ever, I had to see what all the ladies were raving about…
So I sat down with your girlfriends favorite game.. and while it took me a while to get it.. I got it…
The Good of animal crossing new horizons is its addictive and calming, a game all about chosing the layout of your island and building it, letting it flourish.. learning new items to craft, becoming friends with your neighbors, ctaching bugs, fishing, collecting shells.. palnting flowers, planting trees.. just enjoying the breaze through your Nintendo switch, all on your journey to make your newly aquired island livable.. you can earn cash by selling these items you collect and use this cash to buy items to furnish your home or pay of your debts to obtain an even bigger and better home… its anice little carrot at the end of this stick, collect, craft, design until youre statisfied.. there is no end goal here.. this is a game all about playing until youre done.. not until the game is done.. until you are done, until youre bored of it.. as this is a game meant to be played throughout the years to come.. stopping in for an hr or so a day, slowly progressing your island… and onto the bad of animal crossing progression here is far too slow, it took me 6 real time days to do anything beyond fish or collect bugs… as once again this game runs in real time, when youre told a building will be done tomorrow, the game literally means tomorrow, but for the sake of this review I time skipped with the switches settings.. I get that this is a game meant to be chipped away at, but I feel its ridiculous to expect someone to invest 6 days into a game they just purchased before things start getting good… and the only other bad here is coop.. you cant share your nintendo switch with your significant other or siblings… one switch shares an island.. but other than those 2 huge knocks theres everything here an animal crossing fan could want… and for those into games they can hop into to relax, destress, and decorate a little, catch some bugs or fish, dig some fossils for the museum..
The decorator in you, the collector in you.. both will shine with excitement for hours…
For me personally Animal Crossing New Horizon got 10 hours out of me before I was over it.. but its okay to be over it.. This is what makes this game so special, Theres no pressure, everything is at your pace, and the day or hour you decide to leave your island is a day youll look back with memories of collecting or gathering this, the moment you spent inside of your head as you fished.
Animal Crossing New Horizons is one giant exhale.

kamhagh,17-04-2020,"as someone who really loved Stardew Valley I was really excited to try this game but honestly it's been disappointing. SPECIALLY for 60$ if this game was 30$~ My rating would be say 6.
let me say that the first week of my game play was absolutely a blast and very fun!
but after a week? the real time clock soon turned into an annoyance rather than a good thing.
and the game feels like a chore. constantly spamming and clicking buttons to get wood and water my flowers as I don't even pay attention and read stuff online. I thought to myself after a while ""what even is the point?""

i start my morning by just water my flowers which with the bad controls takes a long time. then I chop some trees and pick fruits. by then i'm so exhausted and bored that I don't even bother with anything else. there simply isn't much to do. Stardew Valley leaves a lot to explore and do!

the controls aren't nice. I don't like how you have to wait for the flowers to sparkle to tell if they're watered . with a lot nearby it's not a nice way. a lot of the mechanics like donating to the museum feel so unrewarding. I feel no reason to do it. unlike stardew valley that I donated every first of any item I got there.

stardew valley is simply 20x better and costs less than half as much when not on sale.
it started of very fun but they haven't managed to make the tasks rewarding. there's just something about the animations the speed of them and the rewards that you get for them that makes this game not fun. and I LOVE games like this. farming stuff and the type where you get stuff and unlock more new stuff. this is my fav genre of games so it's not a ""I only like call of duty"" kind of issue, They just haven't made it work well for me. But a lot of my friends absolutely love it so yeah. It sadly doesn't have a demo. but a demo would be unfair since the first week of this game is actually fun since your'e showered with new items and don't have much time consuming but boring tasks to do.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Like most Switch owners, I was very excited for this release. I felt like this would be a great game to enjoy with the wife and our 8 year old daughter. The game looks very cute and the characters are adorable. The graphics are easily the biggest +. The concept itself is great but the execution is just terrible. This game was released before it was finished. Its as simple as that. This is not a complete game. There isn't really any campaign which is just preposterous. It would have been so easy to send your character on a variety of cute quests to help the islands residents, but no... Everything about this game, aside from the graphics need to be refined. It feels like no one tested this game before it was released. There is a long list of issues that should have been fixed prior to release. No option to craft multiple items (unbelievable). Not enough resources to craft things (even if youre prepared to grind). Terrible controls for building (its a crafting game but you feel very limited in what you can do and where you can place things). Not enough quests. Seriously just preposterous. Even the mobile version of this game has better quests. All you do is keep paying off enormous loans to build up your house, its just an endless grind that isn't very creative or innovative. This game is the definition of half-baked. I wont even get into the fact that its only one island per console. In my opinion Dragon Quest Builders II is a much better game if you want to play a crafting type game. There are just so many things about this game that aggravate me when its being touted as a game that is enjoyable and relaxing. I guess I will give it a 3 because of the beautiful graphics, otherwise I would be hard pressed to pay $20 for this half baked rubbish",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

EdwardG,03-07-2020,"Cute, but tedious and more of a long chore than an engaging game. That's the impression I've been left with after 40 hours with Animal Crossing, and I'm honestly surprised I lasted that long. Then again, it is designed to get you playing every day as you're drip fed progress whilst you do the same boring tasks every day like picking up stones one by one or fishing where you can't move your line after casting it without just casting it again altogether. There's a lot of quality of life improvements that could be made here that even fans of this game have to admit, like being able to craft multiple items at once, for example. There's a lot of repeat dialogue that gets annoying as well, and when you give Blathers a new fish, insect or fossil in the museum you have to click through the same bunch of stuff every time for every item you bring before he'll tell you an interesting fact about it.

I can see the appeal a game like this might have to some people, as it is an escape from the real world where everything is pretty chill and you can design your island as you please. I found it really stressful though, and I know that might seem weird to some people. But the daily grind got to me, slowly ticking off those menial tasks and stressing over how to decorate my home. That might sound silly but if you're not the most creative person or you fuss over the little things, you might get a little stressed too.

There are some things I liked. It's got a very cute aesthetic and the museum is a really nice way to show off all the things you've caught and found. There's a lot of freedom in what you wear, and how you design your island and house which is great for creatives.

I wish I could've loved this game like it's many fans do, but I found it boring and stressful. It's got the Nintendo polish you'd expect, but also some quirks about not being able to have islands linked to individual accounts instead of the console that many people have complained about. Overall, I'd have to score this game 6/10. I might check it out again some time down the line, as it is getting updated with new seasonal events but I doubt those would fix my personal issues with the game.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

MICKticken,15-04-2020,"this game gets a lot of flack for being boring. And I 100% agree. Upon starting this game, the player realizes how much of a time sink this game is. The first literal week of playing is a dull time. If the game progressed at the early game's pace it would be a failure. that being said, once you get the ladder things pick up dramatically. Animal Crossing evolves so wonderfully into this symphony of good vibes that you can't help but smile. everything is charming. The idle pose for your villager is putting his arms on his hips, similar to how I feel every time I do something right. there are 3 big downsides if you play this game. Online Multiplayer is a slog and really uninteresting. In fact, it takes a minute for anyone to even join your island. Nintendo has never seemed to understand how online multiplayer works, this game only proves that. The 2nd downside is the slow start. The first week or so is a disappointment. Nothing seems to ever happen. you get told to do menial tasks with the goal of god knows what. the clunky tedium of every action gets on your nerve quick. the 3rd thing is no mini-games. in the first Animal Crossing, you could unlock a bunch of NES games to play. there isn't any equivalent in New Horizons. the closest thing is running away from bees/spiders. the tedium is the gameplay.

A collectors dream game! With thousands of fish, bugs, fossils, paintings, furniture, and clothing items this game will keep anyone busy. It's very slow. It goes by real world time, but can be tricked by adjusting the system time in order to speed things up or even play into the ""Stalk"" market to gain an absurd amount bells early on. 10/10

The terraforming leaves a lot to be desired. It is very slow and tedious with only being able to change one space at a time. If you mess up you just wasted twice the amount of time on one space. 9/10

As someone who doesn't share their console with other people I never felt like I was in the backseat. However, I have taken a point off for the highly flawed multi-user experience as I feel it does take away from the game. 8/10",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

I haven't lost my Switch once, but I really don't wanna risk it. I see a lot of people giving this game awful reviews just because you can only have one island per console. Grow up. I understand that some people might want more consoles if their entire family plays on the console, but please don't give the game 1/10 reviews only for that.

Ditobi,12-04-2020,"STOP REVIEW BOMBING with fake WORDS 4SSH0L3S

Vengo siguiendo esta saga desde el Wild World y luego descubrí sobre los anteriores, incluso el de 64 para japón.

Esta edición para Switch es simplemente magistral. Han logrado cosas que realmente creo que eran muy necesarias, como el de colocar objetos tanto dentro como fuera de la casa.

Hasta ahora, la profundidad de los animales ha sido muy satisfactorio. Recuerden que el juego básicamente es como un simulador de vida y los animales deben sentirse únicos y no como bots a como pasó con New leaf, que se les sacrificó por temas de poder mejorar otros aspectos como el de los proyectos municipales.

No comprendo la queja de la gente con el tema de la isla.
Influencers de youtube, por no decir POSSERS que jamás tocaron un AC en su vida, dijieron que querían más gente para el online en la isla... le dan hasta 8 y ahora se quejan del online. ¿De verdad? Era obvio que iba a pasar eso, basta que alguien tenga mala conexión para que se arruine la experiencia, así que nintendo, que mucha gente pida algo no implica que siempre sea lo correcto.
Era muy obvio que eso iba a ocurrir.

Ahora con lo de la isla... ¿Amigo, alguna vez jugaste un AC anterior??? De cuando que en una consola puede hacer que exista un terreno o isla para cada usuario o aldeano? JAMÁS.
Obviamente el encargado de la isla (el primero) tendrá los privilegios a como el alcalde del ACNL.
¿Por qué la sorpresa? La respuesta es clara. JAMÁS JUGARON ALGÚN AC y sólo lo hicieron porque para hacer videos para youtube o por la moda, por no decir POSSERS que no saben nada de la franquicia.

Ahora ojalá nintendo pueda habilitar en un futuro parche el que el alcalde o encargado pueda otorgar permisos mientras se juegan entre varios.

Lo que no me gustó es que ya no hay música entre horas. Era algo mágico dependiendo de la hora y el tiempo (clima) y ahora al parecer es siempre la misma, salvo lo cambias con canela??
Eso me dolió, deberían de haberlo dejado como siempre y al menos dar la opción de que suene una canción siempre cuando se quiera en algunos casos.

Son cosas que a futuro pueden ser mejoradas con parches y actualizaciones, así que no tengo miedo en que nintendo haga esas cosas a futuro.

Es muy bonito juego y los fans reales del AC estamos contentísimos.
Me llegará hate por parte de algunos, pero la verdad duele dicen, sorry si les he ofendido.

Si eres nuevo en esta franquicia, tendrás la suerte de jugar al más completo de todos los AC que te prometerá horas infinitas de diversión y customización. No dudes en comprarlo porque una vez que empiezas, ya es muy dificil parar.

Sharing islands isn't an issue for us it makes it more enjoyable, the games quaint and addictive, with one MAJOR flaw. You cannot hold multiple islands like on new leaf with game save data.
The saves for this game do not save to profile save date or to memory cards but directly to the console meaning multiple world is completely off the table. Not a huge problem some people say. Well, when my 6 year old was made thiwr avatar first it became an issue. They don't play as much as myself and husband of course and us mainly being responsible for the building of the town's and helping our younger chikdren gather materials etc just became a nightmare: even more so that only the primary character can accept any quests.

Butryboms23,01-05-2020,"The game feels tedious and doesn't feel like a AAA game. A lot of the mechanics are so monotonous. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to go through the menu every. Single. Time. to craft. So if you want to craft 10 hot items, you have to go through the process 10 times with so many button presses when they easily could've let us craft a stack of items like Minecraft. I don't think the developers tested the game cuz if they did, they'd realize how tedious and boring so many of the aspects are. Also after you unlock terraforming, you can only break or build one thing at a time and the animation takes about two seconds per block. It took me half an hour to make some simple waterfalls and cliffs when it would have taken a fraction of the time if I didn't have to sit through the annoying animation for every block. They easily could've made it so we could break or build multiple things at once but like I said, it feels like the devs intentionally made the game super tedious cuz they thought it would be ""relaxing"" which it's not. It's annoying and they would realize if they played the game for more than 2 seconds. The villagers are also boring. In AC on the GameCube, the villagers had personality, felt different and wouldnt immediately treat you like a best friend. In this game, they all basically say the same stuff, they're all overly friendly and they no longer have chores for you in exchange for furniture. On top of that, they rarely interact with items or furniture which they do better in Pocket Camp. That's right, a $60 game has worse villagers than a free mobile game. Also 1 island per switch is the worst move I've seen from Nintendo in a long time and they should've fixed it. I tried to get into this game but whenever I try to catch bugs, fish, build stuff or get bells, the enjoyment is quickly ruined by how boring and monotonous everything is.

Namine_Zenitram,25-03-2020,"More of 7 1/2 than an 8...I've always loved the animal crossing series. But of course there are always some kind of problems. Its Nintendo, we all know that they make a lot of decisions because they want that $$$. We still give in and buy the games anyway. That being said here's some things I found wrong.

1st, the one island per switch situation. We all know about it by now. We all dislike that decision. I'm not gonna go in on how dumb that is. Especially since I'm one of the lucky house holds with 2 switches. 2nd, you can't go on the mystery island tours with local or online players. One of my friends and I's favorite part of new leaf was going on the island tours together. Felt like this is taking a step backwards.

3rd, we STILL can't kick out villagers once they moved in, just like new leaf you have to wait for the villager to make the suggestion to move, then say ok. Which sucks, cuz when nook gives you the task of placing the 3 houses for the new comers, you don't know who it will be until after you've finished making the furniture for said villagers. (Snooty jerks should start out in tents like the rest of us btw. But that's another topic all together). That is unless you had the nook miles to fly to 3 islands, happen to come across and convince 3 villagers you actually want to move into your island, b4 the task was given. Then and only then will you know who's moving in. Which feels like a slap in the face, since Nintendo advertised this game to let us pick and choose villagers 24/7.

4th, not being able to relocate the plaza, airport, river openings and the mineable rocks. dont have to explain why this is flawed.

5th, the museum dosent give you explanations on the bugs, fish or fossils once you found all the peices. In new leaf, once you donated something you can go in and read up a little info on what you found. Now you just look it up on your ""collections app"" or blathers can tell you about the bug/fish/fossils you find, if you have it in your inventory. Again felt like a step backwards.

6th, took away the choice of what room to build. In new leaf you can choose what rooms to build in your home. My old house had only the back room, attic and basement done. I wanted to recreate that house. Only for nook to tell me that the back room was going to be made frist, then the side room...again step backwards.

7th, not being able to put qr designs on all furniture items. Also some items not being customizable at all. Example, fence that I wish I could paint white, instead of buying the specific white version. Or wanting to put a custom color on the bed frame, not just the sheets.

8th, no way to load your self made qr designs, from new leaf/happy home, to the switch. If you remembered to take a picture of every qr code for every design you made, congratulations! You can use the Nintendo app and download a non-editable version onto the switch...if you have Nintendo online. Locking, what was free in the last series, behind a paywall now is just shameful. People would have gotten Nintendo online for the ability to visit friends islands as it is. Which leads me to the final complaint.

You know what really would have made people want to get Nintendo online for this game? CLOUD SAVES! They took away cloud saves to stop cheaters, yet people found a money glitch litterly on the release date!...But if you look past all these frustrations, the game is very relaxing and a fun time waster.

Man2Mars,25-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the kind of game that will continue to be playable for years after its release. It is playable at any pace that is comfortable for its wide range of players. I have personally spent the majority of the last 5 days playing it, and there is still so much to do. Because of the franchise's famous real-time progression system, it maintains a fresh feel to it everyday. It's the sort of game I envision myself playing 20 minutes a day for the next four years, not just grinding it all out in a month. The vast new DIY workshop system and the customization customization system adds a whole new level to the ability for the game to be made your own. The ability to terraform he island is also a very useful feature. Overall, the game maintains a perfect balance of combining New Leaf, Pocket Camp, and Happy Home Designer into one game with the new and improved capabilities of the Switch. The often talked about multiplayer aspect, though it does not affect me as of yet, seems to be a major drawback and is the only thing keeping this game from achieving a score of ten. The Switch could easily have multiple islands per unit and the fact that one can't transfer their save data to another console is also a massive inconvenience. Nintendo needs to realize its massive standing within the gaming industry. If it is to continue to dominate and compete with the likes of Sony and Microsoft, it must adapt and allow these seemingly basic things to occur, rather than do obviously gouging their customers into buying entirely new Switch units if they wish to have multiple islands.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Yugare-Chan,25-03-2020,"I really enjoy the game so far.

My coups de Coeur's are;
•The detailed graphics on the critters you catch and the villagers. (you can see fur...omg)
• crafting and customizing mechanic • STORAGE • Flowers grow back
• The museum. It's in every game but check it out room per room. Wow. I also have some things I don't necessarily like. Like how you can not access information on the critters you have already caught. You have to catch it again and ask Blathers about it. It gets a little annoying with bugs. I'm hoping I'm just not far enough in game and there's going to be an encyclopedia app on the nook phone.

Also sometimes I get caught on a barrier around houses and trees and it looks like I'm stuck moonwalking for some reason. A lot of people don't like that you can only have one islands per switch but I don't personally mind. I created new accounts so I could do a themed island based on the Odyssey. When Odysseus was on the goddess witch Circle's island. I understand that if your playing with siblings and you don't want then to mess up your island or vice versa it can get annoying. I hope that maybe for those of you who have issues they will release an update that allows you to choose on your profile if you wish to join the residents of an existing island or forge your way on your own island.

None of the issues I faced were gamebraking and I still really enjoy the game as a whole. I'd recommend it.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
heintzer,25-03-2020,"Great game and the issue people have with multiplayer is ridiculous. There are so many reasons why that is the case to share an island. Also it's not that big of a deal to share.

MrFrijolero,25-03-2020,"Games implemented new features and great ways to prevent other from cheating and ruining the in game trade currency. Honestly a huge step up from New Leaf. It’s what City Folk should have been. The long wait was worth it and they’ve kept their fans happy.

Jakobrockon,25-03-2020,"Stunning. Stress relieving. Unbelievably charming and joyful. The ability to curate your island and enjoy the slow passing of time rather than the constant pressure to build, buy, and discover things on an objective storyline other games work with is exceptionally refreshing. Not to mention, the game is CUTE. The puns, the blathering of animal creatures in place of speech, the adorable poses your character makes when changing outfits.

It is the nonlinear game all can enjoy, if you only look past it's simple setup. If you want complexity, seek elsewhere. This is purely for the young at heart and those than want to escape reality with their friends, or on their own.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Fakit,25-03-2020,"Was going to give it a 9 mainly due to the equipment durability issue however, I changed it to a 10 to try and balance out the unnecessary zeroes it is receiving. Yeah I can see how people are upset that they cannot have more than one island due to having multiple families but the review should be based on how the game looks and plays. On that note the game plays great, better experience and creativity than ever before. HD graphics suit well for the game, and adding in simple features such as being able to place outdoor objects or river hopping makes the experience much more enjoyable. As stated before my only issue is that the equipment breaks and I really do not want to have to carry around more than one shovel, fishing rod, etc. Overall great game, highly recommend.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

writeforurlife,25-03-2020,"I'm so happy to be returning to the world of Animal Crossing. All our old friends from previous games appear to be on the island with us, along with some new characters. The online multiplayer functionality is better than it's ever been, and I like the addition of a crafting system. Of course, with new technology, New Horizons is the most beautifully rendered game in the Animal Crossing series so far. I'm especially impressed with the lighting and the ""fuzzy"" detail on many of the animal neighbors. New Horizons also introduces a new character creation mechanic. No more frantically searching for the ""right"" answers to questions from Bob or K.K. Slider to create a character that looks how you want - now you can just choose from a wider variety of skin tones, eye shapes, and hair styles and colors.

Of course it's disappointing that there can't be multiple ""islands"" on the same device or game card. However, this isn't new: only one player per game card could be the ""mayor"" of the town in New Leaf, leaving the other player unable to make changes to the town. Other than wishing more than one person could have an island on the same save file, New Horizons is everything I wanted from a new Animal Crossing game and more.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

MorningStarn,26-03-2020,"I've been a huge fan of the Animal Crossing franchise ever since the original on the Gamecube and after playing this game for the past week almost non-stop, I think I can say that it's definitely the best in the franchise thus far without a doubt. The game gives the player so much freedom and choice on the fly from changing the look of your character to choosing the layout of your island down to the ground and water beneath your feet. Never before have I felt so free in an Animal Crossing game.

For how much I love the game, there are of course some downsides that many other users also are reporting. The biggest of which that everyone and their dog is talking about is the 1-island-per-switch thing. Now to be fair, this isn't unusual for the franchise, it has almost always been a 1 town per console game ever since the original on the Gamecube, other than my sister who plays this game on occasion, I'm the only one playing so I'm not really affected too much. Normally I would forgive this though since it's nothing new, I would forgive it if it weren't for the other issue that everyone is talking about being the limited Co-op. This is a relatively new issue that started in New Leaf, where being the second player sucked because all the cool things that allowed you to customize and play to your heart's content was exclusive to the first player, so it made being anything other than the first player essentially boring and pointless. I would've expected Nintendo to be smarter this time around and remove that pesky quirk, there's no reason you can't have more than one mayor or an assistant mayor/Island representative that is capable of doing everything that the first player can do except maybe delete the island, but I guess that didn't cross their minds for whatever reason? Again like I said, I basically am the only one who plays this game so I'm not really blowing a fuse over this but for anyone with siblings or loved ones who also play this game a lot, I can see how it's so frustrating. In this situation, the problem is not so much that Nintendo is ""Behind the times"" (they are but still) the problem is more like Nintendo taking 3 steps back when it comes to Co-Op this time around.

Other than that, I think the positives still out-weight the negatives by a longshot. The freedom to customize and change almost everything about your island is a huge positive. All of the new additions are certainly welcome and the amount of quality of life changes regarding the menuing, the inventory system, the ABD and shopping, etc. make me wonder why I put up with the problems in New Leaf for so long. The graphics are pure eye-candy, places like the museum are simply beautiful on the Switch to look at. Playing with friends online is also a pleasant experience, although I do wish it was possible to play on other people's islands outside of your friends list for anyone who allowed that option. Overall, it's a pretty great game for anyone who's new to the series despite its flaws, it is a must-have for anyone with a Switch IMO",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
Aesir420,26-03-2020,"By far, this is the most inventive version of animal crossing. As someone who's been playing since 2002, and by proxy grew up with this franchise, I love the amount of customization that you get with this iteration and it blows new leaf out of the water for this reason. There are problems, but most are not nearly as pronounced as some make them out to be. DIY being the main gimmick puts the control directly into your hands, so you get to build the island in the most literal way possible. Certain construction projects still require you to wait a day before getting to use it, but that's nothing a little time travel can't fix. Time travel, though I personally don't like it, circumvents most problems that come with how this franchise's progression works, and while some people just want to max out their town as soon as possible, animal crossing has only ever worked when there's something important to do. When you complete everything, what else is there? So, if not for this flaw that all animal crossing games suffer from, it'd be a 9/10. Only having one island per switch is annoying, yeah, but at the same time, is it really a reason to give a rating that should be reserved for games like Sonic the hedgehog (2006), or crappy movie based games like shark tales? At worst this game is a 5/10, at best it's an 8/10. Clearly, Nintendo should've made islands pertain to the profiles and not the system, but this game is such a perfect sequel to the previous games. New horizons was made for a certain kind of experience, a one player experience, in which you could do almost anything yourself. I haven't shared a system in years as these games and systems became more personalized and tailored to this kind of experience, which puts my score into perspective, but that doesn't mean I excuse it's flaws. I certainly feel for those who can't afford a second console and I want better for those who are stuck in that shared purgatory, but video games in general have come to a point where everyone has to have their own system, something that was very prevalent with handheld systems like the DS that only ever allowed one profile. Wireless connectivity has taken over and it's no longer the days where you would simply have your own memory card and put it into slot B, then plug in your second controller. So few games do this anymore where you can just grab a second controller and play split screen or do anything of the sort. I can't say whether it's good or bad that games are like this now, but for my personal experience with this game, I give an 8/10.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
SeveralCircles,26-03-2020,"Amazing game that is just too close to perfection.

There are not a lot of negatives, so let's start with them.

First off, you already know where this is going. If you didn't start the island, if you want to contribute to the island, you are going to need to get used to cooperation with the island leader. That kind of sucks. I don't have a problem with it as I play with my family, but I'd imagine siblings having issues with this. Do keep this in mind before buying if this is important.

The other issue I have with this game is the first week or so. It's sloooow. Even for an animal crossing game. It was kind of tempting to time travel at a few points. If you pick up the game, stick it out until the upgraded resident services building is built. It does pick up from there.

As far as negatives go, that's all I got. Now here are a few things I love about the game.

First of all, the game has a ton to do. From decorating your island to designing shirts, hats, and dresses, you'll never run out of things to do. That, along with unlockable features and buildings all along the way, you'll find yourself popping in every day, and getting sucked into it and next thing you know it's dinner time.

Also, the online exists. Its like new leaf's online. Not great, but eh, it works.

All in all, I'd 100% reccomend picking up the game. Ignore the butthurt review bombers who read an article on Kokatu and suddenly hate the game over something that hardly applies to them. If Nintendo fixed the way the island sharing works to allow non-leader residents to contribute more, this game would break the review scale.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
vinylcbm,26-03-2020,"This game is just addicting, it’s hard to put down when you start, it may be one town per console, but it’s been like that since the GameCube version, this game deserves way more credit, graphics are amazing, crafting is fun, etc",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
elFlexor,27-03-2020,"It's undoubtedly the most stunningly beautiful game in the series, drawing you in from the first second you play and offering a perfect getaway during these trying times. Everything feels a bit more polished and improved from the last entry, even though there are can be slightly frustrating inconsistencies (such as the tool belt not storing your tools while the dressing wand does store the clothes) - but those are few and far between.
The atmosphere is simply soothing, causing you to linger and stay for longer than anticipated even if you just quickly want to get some chores done.

Unfortunately, the way online / multiplayer features are handled feels lacking and old-fashioned, but that's what we've come to expect from Nintendo by now - always 10 years behind the latest tech. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the island quickly becomes a very personal space that is best enjoyed alone, with only some irregular visits from others - so I don't put much weight on the online features.

Also addressing the critisisms being voiced in the review-bombs at the moment:
The one island per console limit has been known for a long time ahead of this release and people acting surprized and entitled just didn't do their research. Also goes to show how playing together on one island is really not the main aspect of the game, making the bad multiplayer features I mentioned even less significant.
Having to share one island per console is nothing new for the series, the 3DS had it too. It used to be more easily possible to bypass it as it technically possible to have one island per memory card / game cartridge.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Nohri,27-03-2020,"A great game worth playing if you have the slightest interest that succeeds at everything it wants to do, but this isn't for everyone so you may not enjoy it if this type of game isn't for you.

My only complaint is the lack of cloud saves, and contrary to popular belief, the lack of multiple islands doesn’t bother me, because the mechanic that hinders player twos progress was in New Leaf too, so it is simply a lack of further development and not a step back.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

People were complaining about the fact that you can only have one island per console, but honestly I don’t care. Me sharing the island with my sister actually made us become closer. I also haven’t used any online features yet because I don’t have any friends with the game.

Single player is where the game truest shines. With adorable characters and gameplay that makes chores fun. I can’t not recommend this people who enjoy just sitting back and relaxing.

I understand the issue that the people who are Review-Bombing this game have, which is that you can only have one save game per system. Personally, I play this alone so i'm fine with it. Animal Crossing has never been a multiplayer experience, anyway. Sure, it's had online multiplayer in the older entries, but the game is mainly single player.

justintime42,11-04-2020,"I think 1 island 1 Switch is amazing game design. Something I heard from a Japanese friend (seems true but need to double check) is that one of the creators would always get home from work late. Probably because of Japan’s insane working hours. Anyways, their kids would be asleep, and they wish they could game with them. So they thought, what if there was a game where they could game together, even if not at the same time? And I think that is the inspiration for the shared island game design. Even when one isn’t playing, you can see traces of their play session or they can leave nice messages, etc.

The game is literally called “Animal Forest: Come Together” in Japanese. It’s about working and building an island together. Isolating each Switch user on a desert island goes against that principle, of course that isn’t a feature. People that accuse Nintendo of making a cash grab are missing the point entirely. They are the type that like to characterize companies as big, money grabbing entities. Without thinking maybe, just maybe, these talented developers might have made those design decisions for other reasons. It seems to me many western gamers feel entitled and want every feature exactly how they want it.

People be so angry and review bombing left and right. A single design feature they don’t like doesn’t warrant rating this gem a 0. Did you not read about 1 island 1 Switch before buying the game?

Anyways, amazing game. Fun, beautiful, polished, engaging 10/10. Switch must play.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
BoyCharles,12-04-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautiful game. Players are swept off to a blissful, peaceful island where they are free to explore, expand, and evolve the land. Characters in the game feel like they're right by your side, assisting you as the island grows and flourishes. From the moment you step off the plane and begin your Nook Inc. Getaway Package, the stunning art style, music, sound design and environments craft a game you'll never want to put down. As the game advances with the real-world clock, every day brings an abundance of new things to experience. It gives players something to look forward to, and the villagers of your island really start to feel like friends. Experience diverse seasons that bring a variety of fish, bugs and fossils to collect and fill a breathtaking museum with. Furnish and customize your home exactly the way you want. Shape the island into your own ""happy place."" The feeling of joy and childlike wonder this game evokes makes this game a must-have. However, the flaws with this game shouldn't be overlooked. Every Switch is interconnected to an island, meaning there can be only one island per system. While in theory this allows for people to join together in creating an amazing shared island, giving only the first player the power to really advance is a huge misstep. It makes the other players feel more like visitors that equal players. That being said, everyone is still able to create their own stories, homes, and connection to the game. it's not enough to darken the overall experience. All in all, this is the brightest and most innovative the Animal Crossing series has ever been. This is a game that thrives on moments, big and small.

Ok if you're stuck in the apocalyptic COVID-19 quarantine nightmare... but there are more fun ways to spend your time.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons's release date was pushed back 9 months, but a lot of fans said they would prefer the game to be pushed back more than releasing the game incomplete. So far, this game is EMPTY! all you do is collect furniture and items and recipes to make furniture and items!
New Leaf was full of things to do and goals to reach and achieve unlike this game.

I think it should have been called: AC: Happy Island Designer. the glorified version of AC: HHD.
all the praise from reviewers (Gamespot, IGN, ...etc) is getting on my nerve.

Leo5052,17-04-2020,"The online play is dreadful. Do you want to stare at a loading screen for 20 minutes for every 3 minutes of play? Do you want a nonsensical chat interface that requires you to use your cellphone? That's ACNH online.

Why in the world does every player need to exit out of all menus and interactivity every time a new player joins or leaves? Seriously, this actually happens. You will be prompted to close whatever menu or window you are in so that you can wait for the game to autosave and then display a loading screen that can take as many as five minutes to load.

Why does the game crash if a player gets sick of this garbage and leaves without using the airport?

Why is it impossible to join a game on an island if even a single player on that island is active with a task?

Why are second players treated like second class citizens? Different profiles on the same switch should have the option to play on their own island.

Games have been offering seamless online experiences for YEARS. What a huge failure on the part of Nintendo. You're seriously telling me you couldn't get someone from Rockstar for GTA, any Counterstrike clone, any fighting game, or WOW to help you build this? Shame on you Nintendo. This is an awful letdown for what could have been an all time great game.

Online play is unplayable. Even more inexcusable since Nintendo charges for the privilege of watching that f****** loading screen for hours.

The online experience needs to be completely rebuilt and patched before anything else. Second is something to address the fact that second profiles on the same Switch are powerless to do anything in game. A very distant third would be addressing the clunky crafting system.

I was the second person to start the game in my house, and I am the only one currently playing it. However, there is no ability to delete users or switch who the main resident is. This game lacks the proper communication to users before playing - had I known this was the way the game worked, my boyfriend would not have started playing first. Now, I must either completely start over and lose all of my progress and hard work I have put into this game, or I must log on to his account and play both of our accounts to ensure I can actually complete goals and expand.

Discoduckasaur,23-04-2020,"To start, this game is incredibly fun at its base. But there are some truly asinine decisions made by Nintendo here that simply should not be accepted in a modern game. They don’t deserve to be praised like they are being for hurting customers with bad and artificial restrictions. The good: this game is, as far as straight gameplay goes, truly wonderful. It’s everything Animal Crossing was meant to be and it retains the heart of the series. While it’s missing quite a few of the features previous games had, updates look to be coming regularly to bring it up to par (looking at you Redd and Lief from the recent update). It’s charming, has lasting appeal, and has enough to do that even past the first few weeks you’ll want to pick it up every day. The eh: people with odd hours may want to set their time zone to a more traditional time before playing. I tend to be up at odd hours due to my job and on a lot of days that means I’m not allowed to sell items at full price, sell turnips, buy clothes, talk to most of my neighbors, or catch certain fish/bugs. Time travel still works in this game but turnips will spoil if you do. The nature of the game dictates that you have things tied to time but give nighttime players more to do! If I happen to be only able to play at 1 am one night I should be relegated to only resident services and the museum, with the occasional visit from Whisp.

The bad: if you want to play this game with anybody other than yourself, you’re looking at the most tedious and unnecessary multiplayer system known to man. A long animation is required for each player visiting your item. It requires you to exit all menus and failure to do so means the visitor can’t come. If more than one person try to visit at the same time, at least one will get an error and have to keep trying. It makes visiting with friends incredibly difficult. If you want to have anybody else in your household play the game look forward to buying more Switches because the only option is to share your island. That doesn’t sound so bad EXCEPT only one person gets the full experience. My mom wanted to play so she got her own tent on my island. Since I’ve been playing for weeks though, she gets zero build up, far fewer nook miles, ZERO instruction past a handful of things, and she needs me for a lot of major island additions like houses. Why can’t it be an option to create a separate save file for each person? I’m guessing that good old fashioned Nintendo greed has to do with it. It’s not enough to pay up to $300 for a console and another $60 for a game I’d bet will never see a sale, if you want to have the full experience for everybody in your house on a so called family console, you’ll need to shell out at minimum $260 for a switch lite and another copy of AC to give just one more person. Also, speaking of my mother, I went to visit her for a week and went to change my time zone to hers so we could get the standard experience. That means that all 800,000 bells worth of turnips that I had spoiled. I live in Eastern time and she lives in Central. ANY time travel backward means your turnips spoil. Look I get it, time travelers don’t get to game the turnip market. But I’m not manually setting my time here, just updating a time zone to reflect where I’m at physically. But that makes me a dirty cheater apparently and I’m being punished as such. What else could possibly be wrong here you ask? How about zero cloud save support despite the promise it’d be added ‘shortly’ after launch. How about no bulk crafting for items you’ll definitely need in bulk. How about the first major event completely ruining some of the best part of the game by turning everything into eggs? This game could’ve been perfect. And I know some of those gripes may not mean much to some, but it’s a serious disappointment to me coming back to the series for the first time in a long time to see it turned into a frustrating version of perfection. I have zero hope nintendo will do the right thing and fix most of these issues. This is why I tend to stay away from Nintendo. Every time I give them another shot they take my money and give me half a product. Shame on them, but shame on me too for trusting them. And for playing this game still. Despite everything it’s still too fun to put down, even if I am incredibly frustrated. That’s why it gets a 4 and not a 0, but there should be a warning on every box about all the ways Nintendo will force you to have fun on their terms and not your own.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

It's the ""first player to start the game and name the island is the only one who gets to actually do something"" problem. I've played hundreds of games and I've never had this with any other. As I said before I like the idea of sharing an island, just not the fact that as I'm the second user on the console to play the game all I get to do are the side tasks and just collect fauna and customise a house. If there was no way around having more than one player doing the main game tasks like choosing where to set up tents and then other things I wont mention for spoilers sake, then they shouldn't of had the one island concept. It's just disappointing and frustrating how I cant even take part in advancing the island as a whole.

Co-op is also pointless, you get to pick up items and shake trees, that's it. Another game first for me where the second player does absolutely nothing.

THE GOOD: Animal Crossings: New Horizons builds on everything from the previous entries in the series, the ability to visit friend's islands is fun, the gameplay almost always has something to do, and the vast array of NPC characters is exciting.
THE BAD: The online play is extremely clunky, disconnects randomly, pauses for lengthy periods when someone else joins an island (like a really long time), and is very difficult to get connected with friends. The local multiplayer is even worse, only the first player on the island can experience the full game, players who join afterward are extremely limited in what they can do.
THE UGLY: Playing together locally is even worse, with players joining the main player basically being limited to picking up items and being dragged around the island. The game is also limited to only one island per console with no ability to backup or transfer your island to another console. This means if your switch is lost, stolen or broken you have to completely start over, this is completely unacceptable in 2020, not sure how Nintendo launched a flagship title without the ability for cloud saves or console transfers.

If every profile can't play the game normally, they shouldn't charge a ""normal"" price for it. Having only one island to me at least lowers the value to like a $35 game tops, not a $60. The other big problem I have is how tedious they have made simple things. Why do I have to restart every conversation if I either change my mind or want something different. It would not be a problem if there was a way to make all of the text appear on the screen at once. It takes almost a whole minute of Orville rambling just to type in a dodo code, and if you mess up, that island's full, etc, you have to wait through another 30 seconds of dialogue just to leave, and if you want to use a different code, you must sit through that minute convo again. For a game that almost requires visiting people either locally or online (can't get all fruits otherwise) that is stupid. You want 3 of the color variants of one piece of clothing? well, too bad. You have to go in and out of the dressing room because you can't buy more than one outfit at a time. Also, Home storage should be considered when crafting in your house. I have to open inventory, take what I want out, close inventory, craft, and then put everything back. The UI is not well thought out. I understand it's ""realistic,"" but I don't consider the airports being a pain in the *** and vendors who won't stfu to be something that a game needs. They have either lost their minds and don't realize how tedious this was before even releasing the game (Do you playtest), or they just didn't care. either of the two is ridiculous, especially for a globally-established company.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

CDRMac,08-05-2020,"The basic concept is fun and addictive.

HOWEVER, the co-op and multiplayer is ATROCIOUS!

1. We bought the game mainly so my wife, son, and I could play co-op. We were so excited to travel together and explore other people's Islands. TOO BAD. For some nonsensical reason, that is not allowed. Couch co-op is ONLY allowed on your island. And on top of that, the options for players 2, 3 & 4 are drastically limited. So much missed potential with this feature.

2. Only the first character to be created (the Island Representative) can travel to other islands online. I made my character 2nd, and I cannot travel online. It tells me I need to buy an additional Nintendo Online subscription. That means that if I am playing my character, I am pretty much stuck on our island. Why would Nintendo do this? Why should I need two online subscriptions for one game, on one Switch? I can't think of any logical reason to do this. Seems like blatant greed, to me.

Games released a decade ago have had more robust multiplayer than this. I just don't understand how, in the year 2020, a company as experienced as Nintendo can do such a poor job on such an important feature.

I see that I am not the only one complaining about these features. I hope Nintendo listens to its fans, and fixes them in the near future.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

I enjoy playing with the real time aspect of Animal Crossing so when it’s taken more than a month to get where I’m at on my own account, along with being forced to also progress another player that my brother no longer uses, it makes me furious to see that every solution I try to turn to says the same thing: if I want to become the island representative I have to delete the entire game’s save data.

What would be the harm in increasing the rate of the better fish and bugs and making the game more fun and relaxing. I just don’t get why Nintendo wants to take away the fun of the game. I enjoyed fishing and catching bugs in New Leaf. But now the spawn rate is so low of any of the more challenging bugs and fish.

I personally don't know why everyone seem so bothered about which villagers they have - sure, they're charming up to a point, but I found them all incredibly shallow - very often repeating themselves, and offering little sense of the AI I expected seeing how attached some people seem to get to these characters.

My wife and I bought a Switch Lite to share together, and she was lucky enough to play Animal Crossing first. When I hopped on and had the slow realization that I would be confined to the Island she lived on unless I was willing to purchase a second console (not a second game cartridge, which I might have considered) my heart just sank. Nintendo really screwed the pooch on this one and from the other reviews I sense that they've already lost a lot of customers.

They should make it like the older games where you can have multiple characters, but they should do that all in one profile, so that if you want to you can have your own island or share one, or both at once.

malicousness,22-07-2020,"First off, the game is beautiful and I haven't experienced any glitches since launch. It's fun and the new details are very cute and a big upgrade since the last games. The ability to customize your island is so cool and it gives your island a sense of uniqueness. There is a lot more customization that you were only able to dream about in the previous games....
However, what forces me to give this game a 5/10 is the fact that it is not finished. Right now, we are at a stand still in the game. If you have ran out of ideas on how to decorate the island, then there is nothing else for you to do. There is no additional store upgrades, no Roost, Dream Suite, or anything else that we use to have in previous games. We are essentially stuck in the early phases of the game until Nintendo decides to give us an update.
Also, the use of updates is a cop out for Nintendo to sell us a full priced game that is NOT FINISHED. There is also very limited villager interactions as well. In pocket camp, the villagers actually use the furniture that you have set up. They actually use the half pipe, Ferris wheel, etc, where as all they do is sit down on the chairs or benches in ACNH. That is very frustrating when I have spent days decorating a carnival, a wedding venue, a dinner, and a library and they don't even use them.
This game can be fun, however it is not finished. It is different from the animal crossing that I have known and loved because it has turned into more of a decorating game. Especially since there are currently no further advances in the game (store upgrades/ additional stores), so you pretty much reach the ""end"" like you would when you have played after 5 years and have nothing else to do. I really want to love this game, but playing it makes me really want to just pull out my 3DS and play Wild World or New Leaf.

mastergaming,06-07-2020,"In the end of the day, it's a fun game that you can spend long hours into and it's a good game to pass your time by.

Really liked the amount of things you can collect (e.g. furniture, fish, clothes, etc. ) and the level of customization you can have on your island, house, character and so on. The fact that they keep updating the game with new content and events to bring more to the game is also a plus and it gives value to it. The sound and graphics are simple but fine for this kind of genre. The gameplay is good and easy to learn.

The one island per console was a really let down for sure, I bought this game not only for me but for my girlfriend too, and despite the fact that I already knew about this issue, I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. Has I played first I got to be the Citizen Representative and that removed a lot of gameplay, which includes assignments and objectives, from the second player. The multiplayer in the same console is also really weak, not giving many things to do to the player that is not in command.

In summary, as I said, I liked it, but after spending more than 20 hours into the game I kinda felt a little bored with the the concept and the fact that after some time you keep doing the same things all over again, and you lose the purpose to play. In the future with the new updates and new content that they keep adding I may feel tempted to give it another try and spend a few more hours into the game.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC

Eimear,18-07-2020,Only having one island per console no matter how many copies are purchased is outrageous. It robs players of the full experience of the game as only one player has the full experience. This can cause arguments in families as to who is allowed to be that player. The Nintendo Switch and Animal Crossing: New Horizons are meant to be a family console and game. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is meant to allow players to create and design their own islands but this is not possible with only one save file. This just proves how greedy Nintendo is. It would be reasonable if it was an island per copy but it’s a cheap money tactic that Nintendo has included to rob fans of the game. No other game has this problem. If you want to play Super Mario Odyssey then you have your own save file for each account but Nintendo understands that Animal Crossing is a huge nostalgia game so they took advantage of it to try get more money.,0,ACNH,METACRITIC

However, I have reached a point where I'd love to have more islands to make more themed towns. I'm too attached to my first island to just kick all my villagers off and go searching for all penguins to make an ice themed island. But I can't use my creativity on more than just one island because there is only one island per Switch!

jdax2,24-07-2020,"As someone who played New Leaf for the 3DS, the differences between the games are night and day. Where New Horizons took 2 steps forward it also takes 5 steps back when it comes to features and additions.
200 hours in, the new features (outdoor decor, terraforming, DIY’s) fail to make up for the countless features from previous games that don’t show up. Some missing features are furniture (1,764 in NL vs 804 in NH, less than half), the HHA Showcase, island mini games, some holidays (April Fools and Earth Day so far), Nintendo themed fortune cookie items, gyroids, the Cafe, fortune telling, and the dream suite are the most notable absences in the game. Features aside, many fan-favorite characters don’t make a return in the game: Kapp’n, the Resetti Brothers, Pete, Pelly, Phyllis, Tortimer, Digby, and Gracie Grace are ALL absent from the game.
This is not to say these characters and features won’t show up in one of many planned procedural updates, but the absence of all these features and characters becomes evident once the player accomplished many of the goals set by both the game and themselves. There isn’t much to do in the game after you achieve your 5-Star island. No more shop upgrades to look forward to for the time being, no more shops to open up, no more islands to visit, no mini games to play with your friends, no small distractions that were abundantly present in previous games.
The lack of content in Animal Crossing New Horizons and the presence of procedural updates is a sign of Nintendo’s complacency within the larger game industry. Halo MCC faced a similar lack of content compared to previous games when many of the game modes present in previous entries were unavailable on the release date. An entire year after the release of the game, all of the previous features have been added in. I fear this will be the fate of New Horizons. Whether for their own profit or to stave off time-travelers, Nintendo has chosen to give fans an IV-drip of new content into the game. It took over 2 months for diving to make a return to the game, a feature that was available in New Leaf upon release.
There has also been a noticeable decline in the quality of the features that do return. Characters like Isabelle have been relegated to repeating the same lines of dialogue every time you boot up the game: the same line about her missing sock or the comedian she watched on TV or one of the five other speech options she cycles through every week. Nook’s Cranny has only one upgrade as of July 2020, whereas NL had 4 upon release.
New Horizons does give players a much higher level of customizability than any previous game. Although the furniture options are severely limited, players can reshape the majority of the island to whatever they desire, they can place villager homes in any location they wish, and they can decorate areas outside of the player’s home. Creating custom clothing is given more versatility with more clothes types and now player designs are no longer pixelated, but rounded out when placed onto clothing items. Previously immovable objects such as rocks can be broken to be spawned in a more desirable area. The majority of fun from the game will come from the goals the player sets for themselves when playing the game, which is an issue if you struggle creatively. If you weren’t a super creative person, in previous games there were goals that could keep you playing day after day: additional store upgrades, building new stores, and playing off the more expensive debts for your larger house in NL. Even if you do enjoy being creative with your island, once you’ve achieved your 5-Star island, there isn’t anything major for you to work towards: no upgrades, no stores, and no upgrades for the small side rooms in your house.

Small features you would expect to be in any game are also missing. No options menu to change things like music volume, no ability to donate to other people’s museums, no giving fish or bugs to other players, and most egregiously, no way to have multiple islands on the same console. If you have a spouse or family member who also wants to start their own island, they can’t just hop on another profile, they can’t even just buy bother copy of the game, they have to buy an entirely new switch and another copy of the game. This makes the cost of having two save files in one household go up to at least US$280. In past games, all you had to do was either buy a new memory card on the GameCube or buy another copy of the game to have another village. Many other reviewers talk about this issue with the game and there really is no reason other than greed for Nintendo to make this change from previous games.

Spaghettichaek,06-08-2020,"I’ve never played an AC game before. I love life-sim games. This AC reminds me of the Sims, but if the Sims bred with Minecraft and made a game with a terrible UI and a slight superiority complex through the stupid real time method- you MUST wait 24 hours to build this museum, HA. HA.

It has four main facets of gameplay. Resource grinding, hunting, customisation/crafting and multiplayer. I‘ll go through these.

1. Resources

Grinding for resources, which you have to do with constantly breaking tools, is painful and will lead to mild insanity early in the game. You need wood? Hit that tree. You need stone? Hit that rock. Never-ending. Also, there aren’t enough resources on your island, so you have to fly to other ones created for resource grinding- this costs a stupid amount of in-game currency.

2. ‘Hunting’.
You can catch bugs, fish, sea creatures and dig up fossils, all of which you give to the museum. This is fun enough and relatively interesting.

3. Customisation.

You start on a deserted island. By the third realtime day if you’ve played quite a lot you’ll get some cool furniture to craft. By the 9th or 10th you’ll get terraforming. The customisation options are relatively wide ranging once you acquire them- but the time it takes is stupid and irritating. However, you can immediately design clothing, which is pretty awesome.

Placing furniture, however, is one of the most frustrating things- without a useful placing system you just have to drop it and hope it lands in the right place. Sometimes, even when there’s loads of room, the game says ‘no room to place things here’- one of the many irritating unskippable dialogue boxes. Also, moving things like trees is irritating- you have to eat. One. Apple. At. A. Time. Dig the tree up. Plant it. Making a forest is difficult to say the least.

4. Multiplayer.

If you have Nintendo Online, for 4 dollars a month you can visit other’s islands with full chat facilities (beware if your kid is young and you don’t want them talking to strangers). This is good, because you can see people’ efforts to customise their islands and hang out with them.

So, in conclusion- this game is both fun (because of the customisation options) and deeply frustrating. For a game based on creating a desert island in your own way, it takes a ridiculous amount of time to unlock customisation options and there’s much, much too much grinding. Time travel is necessary to avoid deep boredom.

Buy it if you like life sims and aren’t bothered by grinding for resources.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

flatpup,10-09-2020,"First of all, the user score here is very unreliable as it appears the same person has made a ton of accounts to complain about the way Multiplayer functions and you can tell it's the same person because every account has only one review and it's for Animal Crossing New Horizons.

With that being said, the game has some serious issues. It is severely dumbed down from New Leaf to a very disappointing degree. There are less fish to catch, less bugs, Museum is smaller, less shops, less shop upgrades, less furniture, less clothes and less house upgrades. All of these have been changed in favor of a crafting system that is painfully shallow and does not at all make up for the lost content. Nintendo is adding content over time but it's at a painfully slow rate and what is being added is not even close to what this game needs to be as good as New Leaf. If you are deciding whether to buy this game and haven't played New Leaf then you should just buy New Leaf instead.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
Para_,11-09-2020,"This game is the most disappointed i've ever been with a game I was hyped for. The first 2 months was a great time. It was fun filling out my fossil, bug, and fish collection, and trying to rank up my island. I hit 5 stars, got my fossil collection to 100%, got my house to max rank, and slowly lost my will to play. There is nothing else to do. The landscaping tools are too slow and cumbersome to incite me to redesign my island. Catching new bugs and fish stops being exciting. I have 10,000,000 bells from how easy and exploitable the Stalk Market is. You and other people can't modify an island while hosting, leading all multiplayer sessions to devolve into you becoming a tour guide for 10 minutes. The animal dialogue is repetitive and boring. Nook Miles stop being an incentive to do anything later on due to the absurdly grindy goals you have to do.
The core gameplay loop stops being fun after a month, and makes me regret spending $60 on the game. Nobody I know that picked the game up at launch still consistently plays, and ive heard countless people say the same thing online. They're trying to add new content, but it's far too little, too late and I couldn't be bothered. Whenever I turn the game on, I play for less than 10 minutes, and go play something else. I want to love this game so bad after playing New Leaf daily for *years* but I just can't. Its a rushed, boring mess that has no right to be in the same prestigious series as Animal Crossing.
If you want to play an Animal Crossing game, you're better off playing New Leaf or Gamecube. This is not worth your time or money. The game is beyond saving with seasonal updates. The core gameplay loop is not fun. I am a long time fan that only wants the best from the series, and New Horizons isn't it.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
MrGreen3339,26-01-2021,"I play solo so I don't care about the 1 island per console thing, and it's been done to death already so let's talk about the game's other glaring flaws.

- The dialogue is repetitive and uninteresting across the board. It makes me want to skip NPC text and makes villagers feel like decorations rather than actual people.
- Early game progression is so linear. Your early villagers are selected from 2 personality pools rather than from all villagers.
- The music is very forgettable outside of the K.K. Slider songs (which arguably don't count due to all but 4 of them returning from previous games) and the main theme.
- There's only 1 shop upgrade, despite the older titles having 4 upgrades.
- Content is drip fed through updates rather than being available from the start, which brick walls you if you finish the new content too fast.
- So many classic NPCs are gone for no reason.
- Crafting is cumbersome and feels unneeded after a while.
- The whole game feels like it's focused on being a sandbox instead of a life sim.

Seriously, if you have a 3DS, buy New Leaf instead. It's better in basically every way and is significantly cheaper. Or just emulate the older ones",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
BennyDahBoi,03-02-2021,"An interesting introduction for me to the Animal Crossing franchise, but a forgetful one at times..

I was browsing in a store one day with my family till I saw the Animal Crossing game on the shelf. Hearing everything that was great about the game, I thought I would give it a go. I absolutely loved the first few weeks of playing, with tutorials being idiot-proof whilst also bringing adventure to your mind, where you can ponder what is behind that river on your island.

I also absolutely loved the fact that you could buy tickets to visit new, intriguing areas where you can expand your own island's population from. The art style is very pleasing on the eyes and I the music when I boot up the game almost always gives me a joyous feeling. However, I rarely hear that music anymore...

After around 1 and a half months of playing, I just stopped. I had accomplished everything I had wanted to, bridging to new areas, getting nicer equipment and upping my population. I had realised then that the game mostly was about collecting and decorating. It just did not feel satisfying when I placed a piece of furniture or caught a new fish where a few more pixels where coloured than the other fish I caught 2 minutes ago.

A few days ago, my sister wanted to hop on and play, but little did we know, a 1 island per console restriction permitted that.

Another drawback was the date and time ""hacks"" everyone pulled off with the reselling of turnips, that ruined a lot of fun when friends would just visit me and drop money everywhere whilst I wanted to catch fish and earn bells the legit way.

Overall, this Animal Crossing game can be quite flawed in some ways but I did enjoy my time while I found it fun. I recommend it still as games with stories can take tens of hours to finish until you stop playing, whereas with this game, HUNDREDS of hours can be put in and you can still be having the time of your life!",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
wydy,03-02-2021,"There are only two kind of reviews here. The ""only one island per console"" critic and the people who love the game.

But I think that's not the only problem with the game. From my side there are two huge problems with the game.

You can't do really much on your island. You're possible actions on the island are extremely limited and the size of the island is small. There isn't much discover on your island. The game seems to miss a lot of feature to keep you interested for a longer time to play. Sure there are other Islands to discover, but they are randomly generated, small and don't add something new. They're just like your island with the same actions to do.
You can't plant different vegetables/fruit and farm it. You can't have animals for milking. There are Apple trees. But you can't make apple juice or marmalade. You can only pick up the apples and sell it. There aren't secret dungeons to discover, mysteries to solve. You can craft new items and furniture, but they're mostly only cosmetic and don't add new features. There is no discovery or crafting system to keep you interested.

They added a real time day. So it's always the same date and time as in real life. You can't go to sleep and wake up on the next morning in the game. That add a huge time-sink in the game. You can play about 15min and then your daily ""work"" on the island is done and you have to wait till the next day. The same with the seasons, you have to play for a year to see every season in the game.

From my point of view, the game seems unfinished and miss a lot of features to keep you interested for a longer period of time",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

Nomine,16-06-2021,"I spent close to $400 to be able to play this game and I feel as though I and all other Animal Crossing fans have been scammed . After years of waiting , Animal Crossing fans were excited to hear there was a new mainline Animal Crossing game coming which promised amazing new features for decorating and truly customizing the exterior of your town . It was a bit suspicious that they only showed the beginning of the game in the promotional material and didn’t showcase any of the rest of the things that are present in every other Animal Crossing game once you progress past the beginning . But , people figured there was a good explanation for this and , of course , expected that the game would include all the features that all the other mainline Animal Crossing games have because those things are what makes a mainline animal crossing game a mainline animal crossing game and differentiate them from the spin off games which are missing those features . However , once the game launched and people played it for a few weeks it became clear all those things were completely absent from New Horizons and that New Horizons only featured about 1/4 of the content of a normal Animal Crossing main title . When the game released , Nintendo promised to continuously update it for a few years and , in the beginning , they did do some fairly significant updates . This lead people to believe that the missing features in the game would come in the future but it is clear now , after a year of playing and seeing the updates get fewer and further between , that the game is never going to update to the point it can be considered the mainline Animal Crossing game that they claimed it was . The game itself is more like Animal Crossing Happy Island Designer than a mainline Animal Crossing Game . If you think of it as an Animal Crossing spin-off game for decorating an island then it is actually fairly fun , although , a bit unnecessarily tedious . If they had advertised it truthfully like that fans would have been happy with the game . But , the deceit of calling it a main line game , knowing it would mislead their customers into spending money , and then stringing them along for a year before revealing their trickery so there is no hope of fans getting their money back is , frankly , unforgivable . I would not have paid $60 for this game let alone the $400 I had to pay to buy the game , a Switch , and Nintendo Online to be able to play it properly . And that’s another thing , on top of having much fewer items than previous games ( despite essentially being a decorating simulator ) , you are required to pay for Nintendo online and trade with other players to be able to get half of the items . They want you to trade with your friends but no one has enough friends who want to spend hundreds of hours trading on animal crossing to be able to get every item they want ( especially since there is nothing to do for entertainment when you connect online with friends like there was in past games ) which forces them to go online and meet up with sketchy strangers who often try to scam them because there is no mechanic in game to be able to trade online safely . It’s clear this was just another tactic to get people to spend more money on the game without regard to making an enjoyable gaming experience . That seems to be the overarching theme of this game . They wanted to scam millions of fans into buying New Horizons with false promises of a mainline Animal Crossing game when the reality was an unfinished cash-grab , scam people into buying a Nintendo Online subscription to be able to fully play said game , and scam people into buying a Switch so that they will buy more games for it from them in the future . Well , in the future , unless they decide to make it right and actually update the game to being a proper Animal Crossing mainline game , I will never buy a Nintendo game at release again and I will buy all my Switch games used so that I do not support this company .",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
nahobino5_,22-06-2021,"After 500+ hours, I can confidently say that I know almost everything about the game and I have no more motivation to play it. Even without time travelling, it has become too easy to progress. You quickly run out of essential things to achieve. You can decorate outdoors now, which is great, but the variety in items is too limited. The game also very quickly starts dropping below 30 FPS if you decorate MODERATELY (not even talking about cluttering!) and if you're sensitive to that, it's horrible. Island building is an amazing new feature, but this seems to be at the cost of many other things. Way too little events, no more fun buildings like the coffee shop and not many special villagers as well. It's really missing that depth. You can now go on island trips to 'choose' your own villagers and they don't randomly leave anymore. That's great. Other than that, their personality and quirkiness in dialogue is ultimately gone. They pretty much say the same every two days. In the end, the game is a fun decorating simulator with lots of limits. It desperately needs a 2.0 upgrade with many new features and items.
Another big minus: Every island has a fixed color palette on all items that come in different colors. Instead of collecting color-changing items, you are now forced to buy Nintendo Switch online and trade. This is a big turnoff for me. Say, if you want a basic item like a white streetlamp, but your island only offers rusty red ones, you won't be able to get it unless you trade with someone else. I think this is a horrible feature and takes away the freedom of decorating. This applies to around 60-70% of all available items.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

Otolith,31-03-2020,"It’s a fun game but the multiplayer options for this game when played on the same Switch are ridiculous and warrant a 0 rating. Only the “primary” player (the first player on the island) is able to progress through the storyline and complete certain quests. I’ve been running around the island for three days now and I can’t get an axe to progress further because the primary player of the game has lost interest already and hasn’t opened the axe up in their game. So I have to either log in as them and play as them and do these things or quit. I choose to quit the game. This is a ridiculous way to design a game. I find it mind boggling that developers sat down in meetings during development, discussed this, and decided it was a great idea. Then that great idea was coded, tested, and still made it into the final cut. How does something like this get implemented? Have these developers ever played a multiplayer game? Who actually thinks like this? Who wants to play a game and be eliminated from content just because they are not the “first” player of the game? Who tested this feature and liked it?

Only one person gets to have the full Animal Crossing experience and that's awful for a family game. It goes far beyond that as well, though. So many of the features, items, and even signature characters from previous games have been completely taken away in this. There's some reviews on this page that list most of these things that were taken out, but the point is, this game feels unfinished and rushed. The good news is: Nintendo can definitely fix this with updates, DLC, and general fixes. The bad news is... I'm not so sure they'll actually do it. I can see them adding in *some* of the missing features, but I'll have to wait and see if they'll actually make this feel like a finished game and fix the issue of multiple people wanting their own island.

gogglebrains,26-03-2020,"After a week, I honestly regret playing this game at all. I put up with the slow early pacing, the clumsy core gameplay elements (effectively untouched since the Gamecube days), and the tedious and dull crafting system, because the level of creative potential that New Horizons promised was incredibly tantalizing. But like some sort of Sisyphean hell, true creative freedom is agonizingly restricted by the poorly thought-out mechanics, leaving me feeling miserable for having wasted my time in the first place.

New Horizons' most prominent additions are hamstrung by half-baked, outdated, inconvenient, and unintuitive design decisions, making them far too frustrating or shallow to be worthwhile.

The new terraforming tools, for example, give an unparalleled ability to treat the island as your personal canvas. However, by the time you unlock them, your town will be populated by around 15 buildings such as stores and homes, many of which you'll likely want to move once you gain the ability to freely create rivers and paths. In Stardew Valley (a $15 indie game developed primarily by a single person), the interface for moving farm buildings is incredibly simple and convenient: pick up a building, and pop it down where you want it; boom, done. In New Horizons, moving a building to an altogether new location involves paying a substantial sum of money ($50,000 bells) and waiting overnight. It's even worse If you wish to only move a building slightly, as you have no choice but to first move it somewhere else, then move it back where you want it (requiring $100,000 bells and two days; and you can only move one building a day). I play with time traveling, yet having to wait day after day after day to move multiple buildings around is still incredibly obnoxious even for me; I'm sorry for anyone who's actually trying to play this game in real-time.

Another botched new feature is the crafting system. Tools break incredibly quickly, and crafting more is an obnoxiously slow process. Resource gathering is shallow and awkward, amounting to little more than brainlessly smacking rocks and trees. For some ungodly reason, a crafting bench placed in your house cannot use resources you've stored in your home's sole Storage menu, meaning you have to pointlessly retrieve and later re-store multiple types of materials every single time you go to craft. In summary, the crafting system is incredibly half-baked, pointlessly time-wasting, and the minor benefit of being able to craft some simple furniture is capsized by the disastrously tedious tool replacement loop.

New Horizons allows you to switch between a front-view camera angle (as seen in New Leaf) and a more top-down angle (similar to the Gamecube version). This is a huge improvement over previous entries in this series.... and yet still comically half-baked by the standards of the broader industry. Why can't Animal Crossing just have the same camera controls that have been standard in third-person 3D games for 20 years?",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

I enjoy the crafting in the game and it can be slow paced at times, most of the time. I can make a ton of money doing whatever I want. I like fishing, so the majority of my money has been from that. Even the crappy tools last a fair bit of time. It does what Animal Crossing games set out to do, to be relaxing and fun. I would love to share my island with other users on my switch, it would be a combined effort, expanding a community of friends and family. Something other reviewers aren't considering. This is a great and does what it set out to do. 8/10.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

MattGough,27-03-2020,"The worst game for families due to the priority of one player. The player who names the island is the main player and the others are so limited in their gameplay. Trying to force people to buy another switch. Limitations of second player include:

- Not being able to complete a lot of the quests.

- Not being able to buy or craft tools unless the first player has unlocked them before hand.

- Not being able to move buildings.

- The First player getting all DIY recipes collected by the second player or themselves. Whereas the second player only gets the ones they have collected. - Limited creatures available to catch. In my experience the second player is a lot less likely to get wasps from trees etc. These are probably not all of the limitations for the second player but they are the ones that I have stumbled upon.

It is a great game for the first player but I wouldn’t buy if you are wanting to play with others. This just seems like an excuse to make people go out and buy another switch which I believe to be outrageous.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
joshyleon,27-03-2020,"One of the biggest oversights, imho, is that you cant go to Nook Miles islands together. Instead when I visit my wife's island I just mill about occasionally helping gather wood and water her plants, which just diminishes her ability to play her island. I dont even give gifts in person anymore since unlocking the postcards to friends feature so theres really no reason to visit.

Deorka,29-03-2020,"It is sad to realize that a lot is done for money, to sell switch again and again.

Even if the game present some new features (in 2020 wow...) you can't enjoy the full experience;

In one hand because the ""story-line"" or the building progression can evolve only with the ""island's owner"" (the first player) and so all the others need to wait...

In the second hand because when you play as a couch coop player (i don't know for the online multiplayer) you are restricted, you cannot open your inventory and cannot use crafting, well, you can ""switch"" to be leader and recover these things but this is boring...

And I don't talk about the lack of more interactions with object

So in the end, even if you accept the fact that there will be just one island in the console you have to face 2 major problems that constantly remind you that Nintendo WANT money

It really affect the multiplayer experience so for me the new features are cool but the restriction sucks too much

I basically live in Animal Crossing: New Horizons nowadays. It's a simple but fantastic game. The multiplayer is definitely flawed, but the rest of the game has so much content and has so much to do at all times. It's basically Animal Crossing, but in a completely different setting and with crafting, which makes it so much more interesting than the older games. The multiplayer is the only flaw that really affects what I think of the game, and the rest of it is fine-tuned to perfection.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
SalaciousGoo,30-03-2020,"I made a Metacritic account exclusively to support this wonderful game that so many people seem to misunderstand. Animal Crossing has always been a game where the first person to play has the most control, it has always been the intention to only have one town per console (despite being able to circumvent that in some of the installments), and most importantly, it has NEVER been about ""Progressing the Game"".

Animal Crossing is a virtual playground where you hang out and customize your house, make friends with villagers, fill the museum, and just generally waste time, NOT get to the next objective. If you can't appreciate a game without clear goals, this isn't the game for you, and that really is okay. But ""This experience didn't appeal to me personally"" doesn't equate to a 1 or 0 score from an objective standpoint.

The things you can do as Resident Advisor are completely ancillary to the core experience of Animal Crossing as a whole, and if you really can't tolerate asking whoever you share your ENTIRE SWITCH CONSOLE with to share their island with you, maybe you even have to talk to them every couple of days (God forbid) about building a bridge or whatever you are so desperately missing about being Player 1, then guess what? You WILL have to pay the same premium everybody else does to get the same experience.

To cap this off, a HUGE shoutout to people who didn't like the one island system and gave it a fair, measured score based on an incredible game having one thing you personally don't like about it, i.e. 4-6, even a 3 if you just don't like the game. You're the real heroes.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

EmoDrake,07-04-2020,"This is a beautifully made game with hours to enjoy, but unfortunately Nintendo took this awesome game and used it to try and boost their switch sales by forcing households who only have one switch to buy Multiple.

If you are the first person you get to experience everything the game has to offer. There isn't anything you don't have access to. You can get new villagers, Build stores, paths, bridges, and even change the landscape to truly make the island yours.

If you are the second person to play on the console, you get to experience one aspect of Animal Crossing. You get to make a cool house. That's it. You cannot get new villagers to the island and you can't build bridges or paths. You might as well be playing as another Animal who takes up residence on the island. It isn't your island, you are just a guest.

The fact that Nintendo consciously made the decision to force households to buy multiple consoles if everyone in the household wants to experience all this new game has to offer shows exactly how greedy the company has gotten.

Yes I am fully aware that, as a company, they want to pull in as much profit as possible, but all this decision has done is made consumers angry and against the idea of giving them more money to feed their greed.

The game doesn not, I repeat, DOES NOT allow for individual save states. And it doesn't allow for Cloud saves or exporting save states to other consoles.
This means that, as it happened in my case, you may forever be a mere visitor in your own Island.
A Family member started playing the game before me and is therefor by default the main account. Everyone else, including me, is just a simple resident with a lot of handicaps compared to the main account.
This is a game about developing your own town on a deserted island yet everyone except the main account practically has NO SAY IN HOW THE ISLAND SHOULD BE DEVELOPED.
Therefor the game is unplayable and absolutely deserves zero points.

There's clearly a decent game in there but it's completely ruined by a clumsy local multiplayer system that involves one player being the 'leader' and the other player being utterly worthless. The game allows you to switch leader on the fly but the whole thing just becomes a confusing mess. ""Who is the leader? Oh, you are. Let's switch so I can pick up this item. Okay. Now let's switch back so can open my inventory and give you this other item. Okay, you've picked it up. No, wait, you weren't the leader. That item's now been sent to the chest by Tom Nook for no apparent reason. Right, well we'll have to waste time heading back over there in a minute. But first I want to do some stuff at my house. I'll need to be leader for that and you'll need to sit and wait for a few minutes doing nothing. You know what, just forget it actually... This isn't fun.""

InfernoDragon3D,10-05-2020,"Seeing as Nintendo decided to completely screw up bug spawn rates and nerf the interest rate instead of patching in much needed Quality of Life updates, I am left with little to no enjoyment of this game. At this point, I only play out of obligation and I'm astonished with how they released this in the state that it's in. It is abundantly clear that New Horizons was released in an unfinished state, seeing as there are straight up omissions of features and items that were in New Leaf, and plenty of rookie mistakes that seriously should've been spotted in the testing phase but were left unfixed. Such as the lack of bulk crafting, ability to take materials from storage while crafting, the list goes on.

When there is a fanmade video that shows the kind of QoL changes that could be in this game, you know that the devs did not take the time to fine-tune the game before release. I'm aware a lot of people are glad the game is out with current world events happening as of now, but that should never excuse that the game has problems that should be addressed and that the players should at least be notified that there will be some kind of QoL update down the line. Instead, they go and just screw with the bug spawn rates, just making it harder for people to catch them for no good reason; and even go around and heavily reduce the interest rate to only a maximum of 9,999 bells. Something which was not needed in the slightest and it's an enigma of how they thought that was okay to even consider.

Not to mention the multiplayer is a complete joke when sharing a console with others and online multiplayer is just as bad with mounds of text form Orville to just connect online and even then, Nintendo's netcode is still just as lousy as always.

All in all, Animal Crossing New Horizons is a game that has massive potential, but is held back by a tidal wave of problems and lack of QoL from releasing unfinished. As such, this is the worst game in the series, and I cannot in good faith recommend this game which sucks coming from someone who adores this series and just wants to see the best for it and this new entry.

I cleaned up my island and did significant upgrades in three days. After that, and even during, there is little to do. There are lots of tiny goals to knock out, but to minuscule reward. Grinding towards more upgrades feels pointless because the game starts with little to do, then you get a few upgrades. Is there more to do now? No. More to buy, maybe, but no injection of more activities. Just more fishing and shaking trees. Grind for more upgrades. Is there more to do, now? Not really.

dynastyyanks,30-03-2020,This is the most refined and polished Animal Crossing game ever. My girlfriend and I have been playing it obsessively since it came out. I doubt another game this year will bring this much joy.,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
glypheye,19-06-2020,"Here we go, folks. I said I wouldn't do it....but here I am....about to give a good game....a bad score. But....it deserves it.

The game itself is endearing....beautiful....well crafted....and has the bones for longevity....IF (and a very big ""IF"", indeed) you are the primary player on your island.

My youngest daughter is the primary island owner......and I have played with her as a visitor. I am here to say...that the experience between the primary owner and the visitors is vastly different. Visitors are essentially drones for the primary. There's no joy to be had because there's none of the feeling for working for something you consider ""yours"". And therein lies the rub, friends and neighbors. In terms of a gaming experience to be shared with others....this game is crap. But, in terms of playing the game for one's personal experience of personalizing your island and interacting with AI's.....this game is pure gold. In as such.....to require families to have to BUY A WHOLE NEW SWITCH GAMING CONSOLE......AND...TO HAVE TO BUY A WHOLE NEW GAME CARTRIDGE ITSELF TO PLAY A SEPARATE GAME SAVE WITH A NEW ISLAND......IS ABSOLUTELY A DISGUSTING MONEY GRAB ON NINTENDO'S PART! There is no other way to interpret this maneuver by Nintendo. It's inexcusable and its egregious enough of a ploy to drag this reviewer's review score alllllllll the way down.

There are times when coercive publisher behavior....consumer ransom, so to speak.....is so repulsive that outcry is the only way to change that behavior. It happened to EA with Battlefront ii. It's not going to happen to AC:NH, though I know. Nintendo is too impeachable to the millions and millions of fans. They can do no wrong. Still....there are some here who've been courageous enough to trash the score for trashy behavior. Kudos to you.....you know who you are.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

GameHunter,27-07-2020,"This is the most difficult game to score. I want to give it at 9 or a 10. But what Nintendo has done here is inexcusable, unnecessary, and unexplainable. If your Switch is yours and yours alone, then you won’t have the same issues I’ve been having. It really boils down to the one island per Switch decision they’ve implemented. Our island rep has lost interest in playing, so that leaves me with many hundreds of thousands of bells and Nook Miles with nothing to do but try to generate more and more to no end.
I loved the time I spent with this game. Now realizing that after all this time I spent, everything I’ve earned and unlocked along the way was truly for nothing. And it makes me angry. At this point it would be unfathomable to delete everyone’s save data and start over. I’ve come so far and done so much. I’ve got some rare items, crossbred many colours of flowers, unlocked just about every item currently available in Nooks Shop...and now here I am. Faced with a decision I shouldn’t have to make. Do I delete all this work and start over...or do I just quit?
Nintendo has shown great disrespect to its customers with their one island decision. It may be the shadiest thing I’ve ever fallen for in terms of video games. I can’t believe they ruined it with this decision. I haven’t enjoyed a game this much in YEARS but...yeah they had to find a way to absolutely kill it for some reason.
Very disturbing decision by Nintendo and hopefully not a sign of things to come. It’s sad. It really is. Was it greed that prompted this decision? Idk, do they actually think people the world over would buy a second Switch so they could have their own island? That’s just not in cards for many people. Could I? Yeah probably, but that wouldn’t be very financially responsible for someone who has an actual life to live and maintain. What they’ve done here is within their rights, but I don’t understand it, and there’s no way around it. They got my money I guess and that’s good enough for them.

But to think I could have got Pokemon for the same price!? I also don't get why time travel is a point of contention...

Intro

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the console follow up to the critical apprised portable outing, New Leaf. Nintendo has hit most Switch outing out of the part, so hoping the Animal Crossing would go leaps and bounds beyond previous titles is to be expected. While Nintendo mostly pulls this off, there are a few things that bring this title down.

Story/World Building – 3/3

This topic a bit hard to talk about due to the nature of Animal Crossing. There is not much of a story so everything comes down to the world-building that is used through characterization and everything that happens within the world. Characters are varied and fun to interact with. You normally don’t see the same dialog twice. You feel like you’re having real conversations with neighbors that live next to you. Fleshed out characters help motivate you to keep building your island so all your virtual friends can have their best lives.

Gameplay – 2/4

While there nothing inherently wrong with the gameplay, flaws start to show their ugly head once you start playing for a long period of time. Everything from fishing, collecting items to use for customization, crafting items, and shaping the world to your liking works well. The problems come in with the slow archaic menu system. It takes forever to craft items, selecting multiple of the same item, and talking to villagers for options. The option to fast skip text or being able to choose multiple of the same item would help tremendously. Online play is even more restrictive. It’s fun to hang out with friends but you are locked out from almost everything you can do on your island when someone else is visiting. You even have to watch a 30-second cutscene every time someone comes or leaves your island, stopping you from whatever you were doing. I think everything else works well with new additions such as terraforming landscapes and crafting items, which are great additions but changing the menu systems would greatly improve the overall package.

Technical/Performance – 3/3

Nintendo must have put a lot of time into the visual aspect of this game because for a game that focuses on cartoon looking animals, there are so many jaw-dropping models scattered throughout this game. Decorative items, fossils, fish, and bugs all look stunning. They mesh well with the cartoony aesthetic of the game and make it all the more satisfying to build your island. The soundtrack is pretty good albeit a bit repetitive at times. Nothing terrible but nothing outstanding. If there is one aspect that Nintendo is good at, it’s the technical side of their games.

Verdict

Animal Crossing: New Horizons will please fans of the series while welcoming newcomers all the same. It’s a fun game for all ages that don’t mind playing a game with a slower pace. There is always room in the gaming market for a game like this but I would like to see menus be a bit more intuitive so I don’t have to spend 2 hours doing something that should have taken half that time. I recommend a purchase at full price if you are a fan of this style of game. If you’re not big on life simulation games or don’t have the time to play, you can wait a while before picking this one up.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
TacoLord424,31-03-2020,"I'm genuinely in love with the Animal Crossing games. I've played every single one and have loved all of them. New Horizons is my favorite to date. This game opens up a lot of opportunities for new players and doesn't push old players away. The island is nice and big and has lots to do. The first couple of days of playing are relatively boring but as soon as you get passed them the game really opens up. I want to point out the fact that I am the only one in my entire family who plays video games so I have no experience with the only one player is the ruler, but I completely understand the frustration and I would be frustrated too. Hopefully, Nintendo fixes that in an update soon, but for that issue, I'm docking off one point. Honestly, this is a great game, I highly recommend it.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
TehCupcakes,29-04-2020,"Most of the negative reviews are from people who didn't understand what they were getting or didn't give the game enough time to see how it shapes up after some time.

Yes, it's true you can only have one island per console. This has always been how Animal Crossing games work where multiple users share a town. It allows you to talk to the same NPCs, contribute collectively to the museum, etc. so that you share the experience with your household, rather than having disparate experiences on different saves. It's how the game is supposed to be played, and I dare say it is better for it. My siblings and I shared a town in the original AC as a kid and one of the best parts was hiding items for others to find, talking about the villagers, and visiting each others' houses. None of this would be possible if each player had their own island on a single system.

It's also true that there are some things which only the first player can do... This feels arbitrary and actually is a bit of a bummer. I assume Nintendo did this for narrative reasons, and so that adults playing with their kids wouldn't have to live with their child's ""poor decisions"" or something like that... But as I said, it does feel a bit unnecessary and evokes more negative emotions than positive ones, so I don't think this was a very smart design decision. Still, the impact of these is actually pretty minimal in the grand scheme of the game, as becomes more apparent the longer you play. Some people evidently did not play long enough and just posted their immediate gut reaction.

The slow pace of the game is not for everyone, but oddly most of the reviews here don't even touch on that. You should approach Animal Crossing a bit more like the Sims than your typical game; that is, the goals are mainly to do basic life tasks, decorate, and talk to people. It's much more driven by self-narrative, and your ability to enjoy it is going to depend on your own imagination and willingness to buy into the game world.

Once you get past the initial cluelessness of wondering what you're supposed to be doing, you realize there is a lot to do and the answer is ""whatever you feel like"". Fishing, catching bugs, collecting furniture, coordinating outfits, arranging trees... It's all part of the experience, but the game does not force you to do one particular thing. New Horizons specifically adds some nice touches with the ability to place furniture outside, storage inside your house, etc. which are a sweet improvement over previous installments, and in a lot of ways make this the best Animal Crossing yet.

There are minor things I wish they did differently. For instance, I would like to mail things to friends before I visit their island, but I understand why that isn't an option. (Traditionally in AC games, you can only send letters to villagers after you have spoken with them directly. So they applied the same logic to real players.) It would be nice if the shared-screen co-op allowed you to do things like travel together or open both players' inventories. (The system in place has a leader and a follower, where the follower is restricted in what they can do... But you can switch who the leader is very quickly if need be.) All of these things are rather petty in the grand scheme of things, though.

The game is fantastic and has a wide array of content, with evidence of much more on its way. We have already gotten a pretty beefy patch and a few events, so it seems like Nintendo is committed to regular updates at least for another year+, given its popularity. You could see some of the complaints become irrelevant due to future updates, or they may just pack in a bunch more content. Either way, the updates are really the cherry on top of a game that is easily one of the best of the year. Don't listen to the complainers.

By the way, it's perfectly fine to play this game solo, too. ;) Reviews shouldn't be so heavily weighted on the multiplayer experience only.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

TheBestMarioFan,12-12-2020,"So I previously had a very positive review here. I really enjoyed the first week of the game and it is still pretty good. However, the more you'll play the more basic and uninteresting everything becomes. Characters have not a lot of things to say and they'll even repeat the same line for a few days in a row. To be honest it makes the game feel generic and while the in other games the villagers felt like real people, hre it feels like they are just basic NPCs. For me, this was my favorite part of New Leaf so that is why I edited this one. If you only buy this for the building part. Then buy it. It does that part very well, but if you want an Animal Crossing game with villagers that feel alive. I suggest you buy any of the other games.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Seb1984,02-04-2020,"It's a great game despite its flaws... The attention to detail, the music and the overall presentation is great, as are most of the gameplay mechanics.

Skywise1987,01-04-2020,"Such a wonderful game, I don’t play animal crossing for the multiplayer, my wife and I have our own switches and have tons of fun visiting each other’s islands and trading different things we’ve found for each other. I highly recommend this game, don’t trust the salty reviews.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Kaito34,03-04-2020,"""I can't read and/or am uninformed, better review-bomb a game and give it a 0, regardless of actual experience with gameplay"" -average ACNH reviewer.

To get this out of the way: Yes, one island per device is frustrating, but we knew this and this has been the case for every animal crossing game. This information was announced by Nintendo, has been covered in the media and is explicitly mentioned in the Nintendo E-shop and on the box for physical copies. Review-bombing a game out of ignorance is rather pathetic and it's sad to see such an extremely misleading user score, which hardly reflects the game, merely the frustration of angry fans that didn't bother to read or inform themselves.

As for the actual game, it's hardly a secret at this point that it's a stellar game. Arguably one of the best life simulators and in terms of visuals, gameplay and overall feel, absolutely an upgrade over older games. It's a fantastic experience, a perfect game to just relax with and, unless you're a so-called ""time traveler"", a game that will last you for years to come due to absolute tons of customization and options not present in earlier titles.

However, not all is perfect and there are a few points of critique I have, mostly when comparing to older games, most of which boil down to missing content. Nintendo's approach to this game is to periodically add updates including new content, which is exciting, but creates uncertainty. Stuff like swimming, the cafe, club LOL, the dream suite etc. all seem to be missing from the game and while obviously not a necessity, I believe many fans would like to see their return or at least an equivalent substitute for some of the features unlocked by some of these facilities. These may be added in future updates, seeing how datamines include placeholders for a museum cafe and even gyroids, but what else will be added remains to be seen.

In general, the game is absolutely solid and feels more accessible than ever, as well as being released during a lockdown, assuring tons of hours of fun during these boring times. Everyone can enjoy it- (as long as they each have their own Switch...) and is a top recommendation for any Switch owner. Strong 8-9 from me, depending on future content to be added.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
William8,26-03-2020,"Only reviewing this now because I have not stopped playing this game. I will be playing this for YEARS. Im actually having more fun with this game then I did Pokemon and I played Pokemon A LOT. Not full of action like Astral Chain or Bayonetta but wow, it's just always brings a smile to my face to wake up every morning, explore my island, catch bugs, fish, gather, talk to villagers, visit friends online, etc. So much fun and perfect for quarantine time. Definitely get this if you have Switch.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Less plants, Only two shops I'm the game with Books Cranny only having one upgrade, the Island editor is slow and limited, custom paths can still be kicked off the ground, no daily or monthly events, loading times that shouldn't exist.

JoeQ_,25-03-2020,"Where do I even begin with this game? Animal Crossing: New Horizons is the first Animal Crossing title I have ever played and I am loving every bit of it. I used to be one to shy away from the series because I felt it wasn't a game for me, but boy was I wrong. Everything about the game is exciting and there's so much to do every new day you boot the game up. You start the game off as a Villager brought to a deserted island with Tom Nook and a couple other of animal villagers. Right off the bat, you're assigned with tasks to keep you busy for the rest of the day. From fishing, catching bugs, gathering materials, crafting items, and expanding the village, there's a lot to do on such a little island. This game couldn't have come out at a better time especially due to the current state of affairs, but it is a game that has had me occupied since the day it came out! Visiting other friends' islands is just as fun and it's really unexplainable how great this game is. It's truly an experience everyone should enjoy.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
MekachuDrago,24-03-2020,The game is absolutely fantastic and everything we have been waiting for for seven long years.

DarkenedHill,24-03-2020,This game is the best in the series by far but the multiplayer is a problem.

babbler1202,24-03-2020,Loving it so far. My husband and I are playing together. Admittedly we were a bit stumped at first about only having one island but it's been fun anyway. We keep leaving each other gifts and sending cute mail. It's probably the most romantic we've been in a bit lol. Still a little confused about how you play online with friends. I want to visit their islands but I think that might cost extra and that is a little shady. But the gameplay is super relaxing and enjoyable. The customization options are awesome. It's so cute. I'm honestly spending way more time on it than I expected. A little obsessed lol.,9,ACNH,METACRITIC
kaylers,25-03-2020,"Totally unfair that users are slamming this game with a 0/10 review for the 1-island-per-console issue. Yes, it really does suck. It’s a pain and it does somewhat diminish the enjoyment of the game. BUT there are so many amazing facets of the game! The detail, the nook miles system, the nook phone, the creative ways they snuck in old themes (Dodo Airlines in place of Tortimer!) — they are worth at least a few points! don’t drag down a beautiful game with a 0/10 rating for one issue, even if it is worth the loss of a couple points.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Archangel0528,25-03-2020,"The game is utterly fantastic. With the core functions of the old games and the new functions added in, the game is a brilliant blend of nostalgia and a breath of fresh air. Animal Crossing continues to be a relaxing experience for the player and maintains its charm in New Horizons. It's nice to have a new spin on the things we're used to seeing from an Animal Crossing game.

In regards to those reviews being left that are upset about there only being one island per console, I share this. From Nintendo themselves on the official Animal Crossing New Horizons website: ""Up to eight Nintendo Account holders can live on the same island within each game. With one Nintendo Switch system and one game, up to four of those Nintendo Account holders can play on the same island at the same time (additional accessories required). With additional systems and games, up to eight players can play on the same island at the same time via local wireless or online play. Nintendo Switch Online membership and Nintendo Account required for online features.""

This was clearly stated before the player even purchased the game. This is the way that animal crossing has always been. 1 island per console. The fact that you are even able to have multiple villagers from the same console playing together on the island at the same time is unique to this game only in the series. And they've actually upped this from the typical 4 villagers living in one town to now 8 villagers living on one island, allowing larger families to have unique villagers for each family member. Why would you have multiple islands to choose from on a game that has historically only ever had one town per console, regardless of the type of system the player is using? Playing on a family Wii console with City Folk? One town. Playing on a personal handheld console with Wild World or New Leaf? One town. Just read the information on the game functionality before you buy a game. The game is great all around and is one for the books, just remember to read what the game-play is before you purchase a game.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Tanukky,25-03-2020,"A very cute and refreshing Animal Crossing game. It offers beautiful graphics and motivation through ""setting your own goals"", especially with the Nook Miles. Offers many improvements like the tool ring.

The only thing I need to complain is the long ""tutorial phase"". It could be a little bit boring and during this time, you'll hear the same bgm. Also I have the feeling the animal villagers are a little bit dull and are annoyed very fast.
And there are some things I'm missing like the cafe. I hope they'll improve (villagers dialogues) and add those things in an update.

In overall, it's a lovely new Animal Crossing with some flaws. It was worth the long wait. I don't understand the negative review bomb. It was known for a long time that you can have one island per console. //shrug",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
HowDoYouPlay,25-03-2020,"From a single player standpoint, this game is amazing. It has lovely graphics, as well as being jam packed full of content. The only reason this isn't getting a perfect score is because of the 1 island per console rule. I play with my sister, and I was the one who started the island. After watching her play for a bit, It was clear how the game satisfaction to both players were very different. She didn't get to decide where structures such as houses or shops would be placed, and it was a bit confusing at first to figure out how she could get the recipes that I had already learned by completing missions such as donating to Tom Nook. This leads me to my next point, which is how player two wont get as much satisfaction from the game as player one would, whereas player one had to complete an objective to gain an important tool crafting recipe, which has a sense of reward, while player two would have the recipe appear in the shop, not having to work for it.

Susiesaurus,26-03-2020,"Brilliant game! Relaxing, fun, and just sweet. The new additions of Nook Miles and crafting are nice, but it's very much still the same charm as the old animal crossing games.

Let me enlighten you on the fact that “one island/town per console” has been a thing since the first Animal crossing on the GameCube. No, it’s not a feature that’s been removed from the game or anything, it’s the animal crossing standard that it’s player one’s world and everyone else lives in it. Don’t be a cuck and let your wife or kids be player one if you’re that hardcore into this E-rated game, and don’t reviewbomb a family game as a grown ass adult complaining that you’re stuck on player 2 and have a hard time sharing with people lol.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Doodlles,31-03-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game and something different from the other games from this franchise in the past. It saved the AC games from the mobile ones that they were producing and provides a great story. The game isn't perfect but is enjoyable to play. These are some things I think they might need to work on possibly adding. 1.) Villagers need more life to them like in other games, I think having quests to do from them would be a great way to have a bond with your villagers. 2.) I know this is what a lot of people are saying but, have more than 1 account for a switch; you could even make it to where it only can be another Nintendo ID to have another island. 3.) The online cut scene for a player arriving to your island is dreadful to watch, at first its cool but then after a while of having to watch it, it is tedious and annoying; especially if you constantly have people joining and leaving. A simple solution could be to have a button to skip or just not have it ( If possible). 4.) More interaction with items, this one could be a simple update to make more of the items have a better interaction with it, such as the Tea-Cups that spin. The game would become more fun and make players want the items more if they have something to do with them other than just for decoration. These are some of the changes I think Nintendo could apply to Animal Crossing New Horizons to make the game more enjoyable than it already is.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Shigaion,01-04-2020,"I wasn't even planning on getting this game, but they have improved the series so much with this iteration that I picked it up anyways. Now I spend at least a few hours a day on my island. One of the biggest improvements I've found is that it seems that item randomization in the shops and from balloon gifts seems to be more tailored to your purchases that you have already made in the game, so you are more likely to get items that match the aesthetic or set that you are trying to pull together for your house. Maybe I have just gotten lucky, but when I got the game I noticed a lot of other people had really tightly designed spaces that looked great already despite how new the game is. In previous titles I had little incentive to upgrade my house for a while because of how hard it was to get the furniture and items I wanted in the store. Now I am already grinding bells to get more space. The crafting and customization mechanics are also a great improvement, and while tools that break can be a pain, it's a lot less painful to have to drop a flimsy tool to make room for resources than the normal tools in other games. I can't wait to see what else ACNH has in store, and what will come with new content!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

With a wonderful atmosphere and adorable aesthetics you can enjoy your own life on a deserted island. This was the first animal crossing game I bought and I honestly did not see the appeal before. After playing I can finally say that seeing your island life progress with new animal friends and your own creativity shine to show for others or simply for yourself is a fun thing. I have not even started to play with friends yet but I can imagine that will make the game even more enjoyable.,9,ACNH,METACRITIC
ArronTheG,16-04-2020,"Don't listen to these garbage user reviews complaining about the same one problem over and over again. One island really isn't bad. Also, giving the game a bad review for having no multiplayer progression is just as bad. The solo experience is well worth it. You should look at this game for what it is in total. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a very enjoyable life sim. It could even be called the greatest Animal Crossing game out there. The basic principles in this game are the same as the other games. You pay off debt, do daily tasks, get villagers, catch bugs, and all the rest. Like in New Leaf, you can make stuff like bridges and ramps. However, New Horizons adds new customization to your island. In this game, you can move buildings around and decide where all of the buildings get built. Crafting is new, and it is a very nice addition. You can only craft one item at a time, which sucks, but having the ability to make stuff is a welcome feature. This game is amazing, and you will spend hundreds of hours into it without realizing it. So don't listen to the 5.2 user score on this website; It's the result of a bunch of angry people bringing a great game down for a petty reason. This game is fun, relaxing, charming, and just overall a good time. Give this game a shot, and I'm sure you'll love it.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

The people with legit concerns, like the shared console issues, are perfectly understandable. Especially if you have children in your home that do whatever they want. Or the people who want their own island. Regardless, the game is still good. If you liked the other games, I cannot see a reason for why you would t like this one, other than the said console issues.

Feles_Mala,01-05-2020,"Where to start...
I'd never played an animal crossing game, and everyone I knew raved about them so I thought, hey, we're under lockdown, a nice relaxing game is perfect... I personally don't have a problem with the one island per console as I'm the sole user.

Pros:
It's quirky and cute and engaging and there are so many things to make.
The time of year events are a nice touch, but could be more interesting

Cons:
Most DIY items, shopping items etc are the equivalent of the amazon deals page; a few nice items but 95% plastic tat. I understand the aim of the game is to fill your island with consumer goods to raise it's 'rating' but it really just feels like someone raided the unity asset store for free models; very few things are aesthetically pleasing.

Interactions, menus, inventory etc feel unintuitive (to me);
i) 'drop' should not be the top item on the inventory menu.
ii) I want to be able to shake a tree for fruit even if I'm holding a spade without it trying to (ineffectively) dig up the tree.
iii) Many sub menu interactions kick you out of the whole menu/inventory after doing one thing, e.g. unequip a hat, and if you want to do anything else (unequip more etc) back into the inventory you go.

Dialogs/Messageboxes are WAY too verbose and always on; most games with chat dialog may have a verbose version the first time, and then a terse version from then on, not AC. Every time you talk to a shop keeper you get the whole 4 or 5 dialog box spiel you have to click through (even pressing b to speed things up it's still a chore), want to post a few presents to friends? *Every* one requires you to read 'hmmm, it looks like they have a postcard rack, maybe I could...' - 'who do you want to send it to?' - 'connecting to the internet' -etc, and when you're done, do you go back to the previous menu for more? No, you're kicked out to start again... 'hmmm, it looks like...'
This coupled with the above items means for example it takes *minutes* to buy one of each of the few flowers on sale from the flower merchant; click through spiel, choose item, buy, watch unnecessary animation of bells being handed over and flower being handed back, click another message, repeat. We need multi-select to buy (like fossil assessment), we need shopkeepers to have a 'I've heard this message 300 times, please just say hello and go straight to the wares' mode.
Some shops even force you to click out of a dialog just to exit the shop!

The island-visitor restrictions are odd, and strikes me (as a software developer for over 20 years) as a quick workaround rather than solve an underlying issue:
Why do we need to close dialogs when someone is visiting?
Why do we need to watch a (needlessly long, honestly, what other games take so long for people to join?) progress animation as they 'fly in'
Why can I not place items when someone is there?
Why can I not talk to a shopkeeper when a visitor is in the changing room.
All these things make the friends/visitor mechanism stilted, janky and, like everything else, a chore

Every time you catch or make something you have to watch a little 'look what I caught/made' animation, with a terrible pun, of which there is only one per item: 'I caught a sea bass, oh no it's at least a C plus' (I have stopped fishing simply because of these, and of course, you have to click again, to dismiss it.
With crafting, each item (and YOU CAN ONLY MAKE ONE AT A TIME) has an animation too (while you can speed up the crafting time, basically, you have to sit there mashing a button to make a number of the same items

All of which could be avoided if they weren't pretty much the only thing to do in the game... like, any kind of quests apart from help Gulliver find his bits and help Whisp find his bits.

Basically the only thing to do is fish, craft, catch bugs, shop and those things take 5x as much time and 5x as many button clicks as they need to (even keeping the immersive chatty nature some might like) and all interactions are repetitive, there's no variation.
None of the game-play is fluid, very little is intuitive and that 'what's the point' feeling creeps in very quickly.

If you want crafting, smooth multi-play, adventure etc... Get portal knights, AC did not get QA tested with users playing for a length of time.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Others can switch profiles, but if they aren’t the main account it’s not their island. The game honestly feels like it’s a beta.

YoBoJosh,14-05-2020,"I swear fixing the problem with only 1 island would be so easy... Every other game has different users have different save files! Did Nintendo expect a family to have multiple switches?!?! If they did, then there would be no reason to have only 1 island. They thought it would be some cute little addition to the game for siblings to play on the same island. But that can’t be further from the truth. It’s like a full war, especially how resources can only be collected ONCE per day. Now, I agree that’s perfectly balanced and makes sense, but not when there’s siblings fighting over who gets the rocks or fruit or fossils. This whole thing, wouldn’t even be the worst thing ever, if everyone had the power of the resident representative! Like, my sister managed to log on first, and she barely even plays! But she plays enough that she won’t let me take over her account. So if I want to move a building, make a bridge, etc, I have to drop money, save, go on her account, build the thing, save, then go back on my account. It’s ridiculous! Why can’t the other players make bridges inclines layout changes etc. Not to mention only the main user can do the tasks to try to get K.K. on the island. Also the main user gets certain recipes that other users can not get unless they find it in a ballon gift thing. Besides the terrible terrible design, I like this game a lot and I can’t stop playing it. I just wish Nintendo would listen to the community and make this REALLY easy change.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

She gets to make every decision on the island and my WHOLE family has to share this one island, and all of it's resorces. We ran out of stones to get iron & gold from. The couch co-op mode is terrible too. As a second player all of your items get directly sent to the ""town lost and found"" and anyone can take it out of the box, except for you, WHO COLLECTED IT. This would make sense if it was a 50 dollar consol or something that each person in our family could have but to spend 300 BUCKS to fully play a game on your own is ridiculous. So basically, i cant even play the game, i cant help move out island in the right direction, and i cant play an important role as a second player.

My kids were excited about all the buzz, they were thrilled to visit the website and see how they could make their own little world. Then they bought it. To have that reality yanked away, I don't think I'm being overly dramatic here, but it was kinda cruel. My kids saved up to buy this game. What in god's name are they thinking?

It's lovely to see, in the time of forced quarantine, a game touting itself as a stress relieving, calming, creative time spender, to literally 'yoink' that promise away for everyone but the first household member to log on.

Anyone who has anything to do with this should be ashamed, because you should know, and I don't think I'm the only one: you literally made my kids cry. Not because they're spoiled, or that they can't share, or they won't work together. It's that they saved up for something that was advertised as ""something"" and got absolutely blindsided by a product that is specifically, maliciously exclusive of their creative interests. It's about having watched hours of people loving the game on youtube, and then the game saying, 'No, you absolutely cannot do what they are doing.'

Of course, the ""same island"" mode as it exists would be SO MUCH FUN...if it was an option.

SpookyPigeon,25-06-2020,"I made a Metacritic account just to express how disappointed I am with this game. I've been playing the Animal Crossing series since Wild World on the Nintendo DS. I was SO hyped for this game. I got it the minute it came out on launch day, played for about a month straight aaaaand... I don't play it anymore.

This game is mediocre hence the 5 out of 10 score. Sure the graphics are nice, it runs well and the terraforming is a huge new feature. But Nintendo released an unfinished game. This game does NOT have enough content to justify the £50 I payed at launch day. So many iconic characters are missing. Where's Resetti? Where are Copper and Booker? Most importantly of all where are Rover and Brewster??? Yes I know Rover appeared briefly in the May Day update but honestly it wasn't enough screen time for such an iconic character.

Here's my other gripes with the game:

- Iconic characters like Rover got shafted but we have to sit through Isabelle's boring dialogue every single day. In this game Isabelle does the morning updates so no more Rover in the spotlight. Isabelle is frankly an extremely annoying character in this game, always repeating the same dialogue about how she found her sock or something. She's supposed to report the news but the devs didn't think for her to perhaps report on the weather or mention which town visitors are on the island. Nah it's more important for us to hear about how she finished her puzzle (nobody cares Isabelle).

- Speaking of dialogue, the villagers feel soulless compared to other games. What is the point of even talking to them when they repeat the same crap? And they always get annoyed when you talk to them twice in the same day. What a joke.

- Furniture sets are gone. No more Froggy Chair was bad enough but so many iconic furniture sets just ceased to exist. I like being able to craft but not at the expense of many classic items which fans have loved for a long time. Gracie Grace is missing from the game so now I can't decorate my house with ridiculously expensive dessert shaped furniture - wtf is the point in playing?

- Speaking of crafting, it is a long and tedious process. Say you want to craft 1 fish bait. You can't just craft 100 at once. Oh no you have to do it one by one. Everything in this game is unnecessarily difficult and even though fans have been begging for quality of life changes for months Nintendo don't care.

- Events are so bad now. The egg event in previous days was just one day. This time it was a 2 week fiasco where your normal daily activities were interrupted by the stupid eggs. During the egg event you could catch eggs by fishing, from the sky etc. The problem was that this completely ruined fishing as it felt like 80% of what you caught was eggs instead of actual fish. If all events are going to be like this from now on I'm not looking forward to events like Halloween.

- Town visitors seem to visit certain players over others with some people getting Celeste (who gives rare DIY recipes) every week while other players like myself have never had her on the island despite playing since launch day.

- Finally, on to the terraforming... It's boring. That's all. It is so tedious and so boring. I don't enjoy the terraforming which is a shame because it's the only thing to do in this game. If it's something you think you may enjoy go ahead, buy the game but ever since I unlocked terraforming my playtime has probably dropped by 80%.

There are so many other gripes I have with this game but these are the ones I had off the top of my head. It seems like Nintendo aims to keep updating the game every few months with the content that should have been included on launch day. Apparently this is to ""combat time travel"" (also why they set events to 2 weeks so people would have to play during the 2 weeks and wouldn't be able to travel back to events). I don't see why Nintendo had to release such a bare bones game just because some people are triggered by people who play the game differently.

Anyway, maybe in a year when Nintendo has actually added the content that should have been in the game to begin with I'll go back to this game but for now I can't be bothered to dedicate any time to this boring game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

A_Mighty_Pleb,26-03-2020,"A huge disappointment and let down because of a bizarre decision to have one island per switch with all important progress and gameplay mechanics tied to the first account that plays it.

Context is important here as people seem to be dismissing this issue as not important. Co-op and multiplayer is not the issue, as some people might want to play the way it is implemented. The issue is that any other account on the system that plays AFTER the first person to open the game is FORCED to play a lesser experience that happens to be shackled to the multiplayer experience. It is then not an equapl, stand alone playthrough with all the features of one.

A lot of reviews are fair in their scores because they played the full game with no problems on one account. That is fine. But a lot of people have more than one account on their Switch. To say that the opinions on the game by people affected by this are unfounded is frankly ignorant and it doesn't address the core problem.

It's 2020 and we can't have multiple accounts play their own instance of a game? Yes we can, Nintendo has just chosen not to here. For a game that is trying to be a calming community experience, It has only made me feel conned and frustrated and left out because of this.

As someone who is sharing the game with someone in my household, however being the second account to play, I am forced to be an observer to someone elses enjoyment of the game. If you are not the first person to play this game on your Switch you might as well not play it at all as you do not get the full experience. That is unless you buy another switch to have the privilege.

This is a frankly disgusting and pointless choice that only serves to ruin the experience for many people who buy the game and line the pockets of Nintendo. Even the person who played it first feels guilty for playing it, even though they had no control other it.

Be wary before buying this game; unless you play on your own switch, first, on your account from the outset, you will not have the full experience you expected when you bought it. I will be extremely hesitant to buy any future Nintendo games because of this.

On a positive note, the person who first started playing on their account on my Switch says it's a lovely game. Shame I can't play what they're playing.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

MaeBeaInTheWood,24-03-2020,"This new Animal Crossing shows everyone can make mistakes, or just decide they want to be EA. This is very much just a mix of Pocket Camp, Wild World, and New Leaf. The game has an overly-long tutorial before letting you do what you want. There is also the fact that parts of your island are completely locked because you don't have any bridges built at the start unlike other games, and it's a while before you build bridges or unlock the vaulting pole. Nintendo also shows their greed in wanting you to buy more Switch consoles, as it is not 1 island per Nintendo Switch user, it's 1 island per Nintendo Switch console. And the only way to get a new or second island is to delete your first. This game also excludes the character of the fan favorite and my personal favorite, Rover. He does not appear on the plane to the island to help you (instead that role is filled by Nook's little scouts), and he doesn't appear in the game at all. My only things to say in defense of this game is that for once the game lets you decide what your villager's appearance is instead of generating it with cryptic questions like the other games (and usually no matter what you answered for the questions, you didn't like how your villager looked). The other thing is that Tom Nook appears to be less greedy and more friendly. He has general interactions the way a peppy villager, or Isabelle, or one of the Ables would instead of constant badgering and pressuring you about money like he does in other games.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
andrea3,25-03-2020,"The kids and I were excited to get this after watching the trailer, since we are stuck at home. They play a lot of minecraft and like to play in each other's worlds.

My son can't unlock an axe so he had to get his sister, who happened to get lucky and be the first player, to make him one. The only work around is having the rest of us play multiplayer using her character, but she is still the only one who can complete any of the tasks and advance the game. It's boring and frustrating for the other players. I would return it but they are invested in the island now, but it's creating a lot of conflict. Do not recommend for families. I'm not buying another Switch for me to casually take part in one game. My pre teen daughter who is player one doesn't even play video games that much anymore.

shopme,24-03-2020,"For me, Animal Crossing: New Horizons has to be one of the biggest disappointments of the year. As a single-player experience, I'd say going around and improving your island is relaxing and addicting. The Nook Miles system brings me back to the game everyday to try to save up for new rewards. The new crafting system also keeps me coming back to collect more materials. Even with all of this, there's one huge issue that cannot be ignored that many others have complained about.

Animal Crossing fails the most at co-op. The fact that you can only have one island per Switch seems greedy, so that customers go out to buy more switches. Even if you buy another copy of the game, it won't give you another island. That means me and my siblings are forced to live on one island. The leader and follower system can very annoying to deal with, especially if you really want to get things done on your island. The leader retains all of the abilities a regular player would have, but the followers are basically glorified NPCs. The followers can't access their inventory or interact with other residents. Followers can only use their tools and pick things up. When they do pick something up, it goes straight to the recycling bin, for the leader to potentially steal, or for a drawn out sequence where the players have to switch between leaders. It doesn't help that sometimes my siblings sometimes try to cuck me and steal my resources to sell, or for one of them to steal leader from me. It's also annoying that you can shake your controller to change leader. My siblings just shake my hands and steal leader. I'd really like an option to turn that off. I don't get why they locked these features to just one player. It really waters down the experience for me who was excited, since I'll be playing mostly co-op with my siblings.

The biggest flaw with co-op play, the thing that really kills the experience for me, has to be the Island Representative system. There can only be one Island Representative, the person who first opens the game. They are also the only person who is able to progress the story, along with other exclusive benefits like exclusive DIY recipes. That would be fine if there was multiple save files, but the problem is there isn't. The other players that live on the island just have have a way worse experience. I'm not saying it's not fun to play as a villager, I'm just saying you're not getting the full experience. It can still be fun to decorate your house and to complete daily tasks.

I think this game is at its best when playing single-player. Co-op at the moment is terrible and not having extra saves can ruin the experience for many. Also, please keep in mind I don't have access to a single-player save. I'd recommend this game to people to people who have Switches that only they use.

ErnestGamingEC,22-03-2020,This game is really beautiful and relaxing.The people at Nintendo really put effort into this and it is worth the delay that it gets. Every time you build something it felt like an accomplishment but things like getting material from rocks tree and other needs to take a day to replenish which is disappointing and waiting for a building to be build makes me really impatient all the time.This game could been benefitted from less waiting time it felt like eternity to wait for things to be done,9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Babiel,22-03-2020,"First things first: sing the petition to don't restrict the number of islands per console: http://chng.it/Bz2kfWTc4y.

Apparently, Nintendo is still in 1997. One island per console is one of the most disgusting things I have seen in the game industries. It completely ruins the experience for people who share a switch, not to mention no cloud saves, and no way to transfer data to other system. And it doesn't make sense in absolutely any point of view. If you share a switch, DON'T BUY THIS GAME unless you are okay with sharing resource, no tutorials for the second one to play, and a billion things more",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
lrn2review,23-03-2020,"I'm a veteran AC player, and while I like the game it definitely has its issues. A lot of this review is nitpicky, but at the end of the day if you enjoy life sims you will probably like this. It is overall a nice game.

Pros:
-Almost total control over the layout of your island eventually
-More customization options for furniture, clothing and even your character than before
-HD graphics are beautiful, the new museum in particular is stunning
-The music is great, and has a lot of callbacks to older games in the series
-Villagers do a lot more things than they have in previous entries and have better dialogue than they did in NL; Blathers will blather again if you let him
-Seasonal events now last more than one day; a relief for those of us who have jobs but don't want to time travel
-Extremely large pool of villagers
-Certain redundant facilities were cut, like Re-Tail
-New storage and inventory system is pretty great; lots of more items stack, storage automatically organizes your things
-Tool and outfit rings streamline the UI nicely
-Nook Miles give a nice sense of direction when you just want to keep playing the game after doing most of the big tasks for the day
-Crafting provides a nice alternative to waiting for items to show up at the store
-Outfits are stored in the wand, which saves inventory space
-Very relaxing atmosphere

Cons:
-Touchscreen controls exist for typing, yet are not enabled for pattern creation or inventory use
-Items that can stack have wildly varying limits, from 10 for fruit to 99 for weeds
-The tutorial is roughly a week long if you don't time travel, and you don't get to listen to hourly themes until this tutortial ends
-Autosave system is near pointless because you can still save scum, even detrimental because you can't ""save and continue"" anymore, leading to short rollbacks at times; Resetti got fired for nothing
-Seasonal events are locked behind DRM
-Lots of items and facilities considered series staples are out like gyroids and The Roost, as are some of the best additions from NL like the Dream Suite; veterans are instead left to guess whether or not these might return through updates that may or may not be free
-Villager dialogue is still relatively toned down if you're a fan of WW or PG
-No ability to move the town hall despite being able to move everything else not on the beach
-Online functionality is not particularly reliable, while local multiplayer is messy and requires you to stay in the same area instead of just using split screen functionality; also you have to watch a long cutscene every time there's a visitor
-No option to disable the smoothing filter applied to patterns
-Weapon durability in a series that generally did not have it is aggravating, and having the highest tier be breakable is actually a bit infuriating because it defeats the purpose of the best axe in particular
-Tools aren't stored in the tool ring like outfits are in the wand
-Islands are tied to console and not cart, meaning you need to pay $300 ($360 if you bought digital like a sucker) instead of $60 to have your own if you were hoping to split up your household
-The ""mayor"" returns from NL in all but name, leaving players that come after them left with fewer gameplay options because they can't terraform
-Your regular inventory is not automatically organized like storage is
-Many items are locked behind crafting
-Crafting cannot be done in batches
-Making a mistake in a long set of choices in dialogue often means starting from the beginning again; there is usually no option to go back to the previous choice you messed up",7,ACNH,METACRITIC

Novaliis,25-03-2020,"Most of the negatives that are mentioned in some reviews here don't apply to me, because I am the only one using my Switch to play that particular game. I do understand though, that it must be upsetting for people with family in the household and one switch device, and now they cannot all enjoy the game the way they thought. To me, the game is almost perfect, the only thing that keeps me from giving this game a perfect score is the still not resolved issue with the cloud save option. Considering that Animal Crossing is a game that many people play for years, it would be terrible to lose all of the progress when your Switch gets damaged/lost or you simply would love to get a different Switch console.
Other than that, it is a incredibly cute game that keeps me wanting to go back and play every day, which I was not expecting, since this is my first Animal Crossing game I've ever played.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Ozzburne,31-05-2020,"One Island per switch. Absolutely trash menu system. Trash inventory Management. Villagers do more passive things but rarely give you things to do. Load times are forever for no reason. No way to evict villagers you dont like, and no way to reset their wardrobe either, so god forbid they pick up some ugly clothing out of nowhere. Cant set up DL'd custom design in shop. Honestly this game, while fun to play for a few weeks, is so crammed full of absolutely Garbage Tier design choices, I've stopped playing entirely. Maybe if they fix all their Day One Dev mistakes I'll come back, but seeing as its Nintendo I doubt they even see an issue. You'd think they've never made a game before, or havent been around for the last decade where crafting have been put into pretty much every game, and far better than in this one. Just stay in New Leaf, it made far better decisions than this game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
ShoganUED,09-04-2020,"Poor graphics, no voiced dialogue, small islands, and the worst multiplayer functionality I've ever seen. Trying to play this co-op with my wife & son is a nightmare. Even with 2 switches in the house one of us doesn't get an island and can only ""support"" the other 2 people. We have to buy multiple copies just to do local co-op between the islands. We each must have a Nintendo online account to visit other friends and family islands. Like pokemon this game has been stuck in the past, with out of date visuals, audio, and features. The devs are unwilling or unable to make real improvements in the franchise. Multiplayer was advertised as a great new feature and disappoints in every possible way.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
coltonious,30-03-2020,"Whilst yes, multiplayer is very heavily lacking, that's no reason for the horrible reviews most people are giving it. As a game, let alone an animal crossing game, it is absolutely wonderful full of life and care. As a singleplayer experience, it is absolutely wonderful. I don't honestly understand why people are treating it so poorly for it's same screen multiplayer. While I can admit it's very strange, and not well done, people are treating it as if it is something that has been in every game and was ruined in this game. This is the first time that same screen multiplayer has ever been implemented, so it works alright for what it is. The only thing keeping it from a perfect 10 in my opinion, is the fact that others who live on the island other than the first person to move in, can not place things around the island, only in their own home. This takes away a lot of what this game advertises, and leaves the game essentially New Leaf + crafting. The game is wonderful, and anyone who needs a life sim or something to help them relax from their stressful life should buy this game.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

The game itself is fun for the most part, even if it feels like it needs more variety after a while. It is clearly a game to just have fun with and if I could actually play the game properly, it might be fun for me. My wife is enjoying it (primary player) though. Multiplayer aspect is incredibly shallow too, I expected more from that.

Jordboy1,24-03-2020,"This game is everything I was hoping the first console release since the Wii to be. It takes everything great from the series and expands on it. I admit that as a fan I was bit bogged down by the 3DS New Leaf. It made the game feel more like work and a job to me instead of the laid back relaxing life I was used to in the past titles. However New Horizons makes it just feel like part of the everyday activities. I was afraid of the additions from the mobile game ruining the usual experience as well, but they implemented it in such a way as it just feels like an option and not a requirement to craft at all. Though it does make it nice to have both options when you're low on money OR low on supplies you always have a way to get the tools you need! The airport is an awesome addition as well as it's used for your travel between friends' towns as well as getting to use Nook tickets to visit islands that have more recources than your own! Especially if you play solo. You get the benefits of visiting a friend's island without needing a friend for it! All of the people bashing this game over the shared island when having more than one account on the same system....that's part of the series's charm. You always share an island in every version on the consoles. If you want it to be like on the DS or 3DS you can always get separate Nintendo Switches and have your own islands JUST like on those versions. The fact that you can play locally on the same system at the same time together is a HUGE add to multiplayer and I think they've done so many great things in this version. I also think that the addition of building up to getting the musuem and other buildings in this version is done in a very satisfying way where you don't have everything right away like the old ones (so you feel like there is something to work toward) but it doesn't feel like a chore or a job like in New Leaf. As someone who was a bit disappointed with New Leaf, I love this new one and am excited as I grow my new animal home! See you on that island life, neighbors!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Laneybehr,24-03-2020,"This game makes me so happy! It’s not incredibly story-driven like a lot of today’s games, but it’s more about the day-to-day life of your villager. Instead of checking off quests & deadlines, you set your own pace for how you want to play. Do you want to cross-pollinate flowers to make new colors? Do you want to catch all the fish and find all the bugs? Do you want to fill up your museum? Do you want to design a dream island?? You can do ALL of that - the beauty of this game is that you get to choose what you want to do. It’s not a game about stress, speed, time, combat, or achievements (although there ARE achievements, the game doesn’t revolve around them). It’s about enjoying yourself!

I wish Nintendo had handled the multiplayer a bit differently. And I wish there were more things to do with friends when visiting their island/vice versa! But ultimately this game is relaxing, adorable, and fun.

10/10 would recommend!!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Richsince95,24-03-2020,"This game is fantastic so far. New Horizons gives a stronger, better sense of progression and accomplishment than any previous Animal Crossing game. While the player character essentially starts from scratch on a deserted island, there is no shortage of things to do even within the first week. Villagers are as charismatic as ever, and the catalogue of fish and bugs to catch, fossils to discover, items to craft, and Nookmiles rewards to earn is astounding. Only a few days in, my wife and I have had multiple chance-encounters with special NPCs that add a sense of intrigue and wonder to the game. As a cherry on top, the game is also beautiful; the aesthetics, soundtrack, and sound-design make for a soothing and satisfying experience.

I personally think the co-op play is great. My wife and I inhabiting the same island is not an issue, and in fact we enjoy working together and surprising one another with our creative ideas and discoveries. While it would be nice if we both had all the freedoms that the ""leader"" position offers at once, it is so quick and easy to switch leaders that we have no problem tag-teaming whatever we're working on. If I could ask for one thing, I would a split-screen co-op feature. However, the current system serves well in its own rite.

I'm very excited to continue playing New Horizons, developing our island, and making new discoveries. I appreciate the hard work that's gone into this game, and I'm thankful in advance for the content updates that will continue to make this game an exciting and enjoyable experience.

Desde la E3 se nos confirma una isla por consola y eso no fue novedad para mi por que es algo normal en la saga compartir el pueblo con otros 3 avatares o personas, pero el que puedas jugar al mismo tiempo con otra personan ayuda a facilitar ciertas tareas y hacen el día más difrutables .

La gente que lo tiene bien en claro sabía que si quería ser individualista o compartir su isla con sus seres cercanos, muchos tomaron la precaución de compar una consola antes o se esperaron a la edición especial y eso esta bien para unos y mal para otros, pero no es novedad tener que comprar otro consola para poder jugar otros títulos multijugador con otra persona cercana a ti, como el caso de mosnter hunter, splatoon, o pokemon por que no se pueden jugar de dos al mismo tiempo y mucho menos compartir la partida.

mwnobles,25-03-2020,"An amazing installment for the Animal Crossing Series. The game design and detail is amazing, the ability to edit so much of the island is great. They've added a lot of features, but they've taken some away. I've been playing since Gamecube, and it meets the AC formula and expands on it.

These reviews I see about it needing to be more open world, in my opinion, would be against the Animal Crossing feel and design. It's not an RPG, it's a sim where you interact with the villagers and relax.

The other reviews about people complaining how Nintendo is like EA are completely unjustified. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember on Gamecube if you wanted your own town, you had to get another memory card. City Folk for the Wii was one town per Wii. I believe Wild World and New Leaf you may have had to just buy the game again, not sure about that one. However, it's always been pretty based around sharing a town if you share a console. I also don't have to pay to win. Nor is it a trash game with a amazing title slapped on it to make a grab for money(Battlefront).

Objectives are just kind of there if you want to do them, they're handed to you as you play. Reviews are saying objectives aren't clear, but what's not clear about just living life on a island? There isn't really suppose to be a point to the game, you just get creative.

I would wish that they would bring the art exhibit back to the museum, as well as the swimming mechanic from New Leaf. Other than that, amazing game. Brings back a lot of the same ideas from the Gamecube. Long Live Wisp!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
KageKuni,25-03-2020,"I recommend for anyone seriously on the fence about buying this game to watch the directs. Spoil yourself. There is no story to Animal Crossing, no two playthroughs are alike, there is nothing to spoil. Research and make an informed decision. I share my switch with two other adults, they work, I don’t. Couch Co-op works fine. People are upset that Followers can’t talk to villagers and doesn’t have an inventory while in Co-op mode. You can still access the tools you already had and anything you pick up enters the box in town hall. Everything people are complaining about was stated in the Animal Crossing Direct and in other information outlets before preorders were made available, and with that knowledge the complaints seem pretty unwarranted. The game itself is very cute, very Animal Crossing, and very easy to pick up for new players. customization is more extensive than in any previous AC game, allowing for more unique experiences in the game. Online multiplayer is also super easy compared to New Leaf and I find my island has become a hangout hub for all the friends who’ve visited. For fellow Time Lords, There is also notably no and I repeat NO consequence for Time Traveling, assuming you stop at every day on your journey, talk to every villager once per in-game day, Sell your turnips within the week you bought them in, and collect your bonus Nook Miles at the start of every day. I feel like a lot of NPCs who seemed a little bland in New Leaf have been revitalized in this entry (Blathers especially.) Many NPCs from past games are not present however; those who enjoyed City Folk’s Cafe and were hoping for a return will be disappointed.

Overall I can’t get enough of this game. There are some choices I question, not bundling a certain Cutting Board recipe with the Ironwood Kitchenette, specifically, but it’s a fun game nonetheless, and I recommend it to returning fans from previous AC games, or to people who don’t even play games usually.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

This new installment is an evolution and they have truly perfected an already polished formula. I have spent many hours on my island, and with countless hours more ahead of me.

I haven't got a Nintendo Online membership but so far I don't really miss it.

SirLedyuka,30-05-2020,"TL;DR
The game is not finished nor polished. it looks like a giant beta with lots of feature that Nintendo put in the game for testing, but are very limited. I'm convinced the team that developed AC:NH is not as skilled nor experienced in game design than the one who've done the previous games.

This game is a deception:
- One island per console. You want to play with your relatives? Buy a new console you pigeon!

- The local multiplayer is simply awful: the current player is considered ""Master"" and the second player a ""Slave"". As a slave, you can do absolutely nothing. NOT EVEN OPEN YOUR OWN INVENTORY. The local multiplayer is basically useless.

- The UI design is bad, really bad. You need to pass 3 dialog boxes minimum before even reaching the feature you want. Characters talk to say nothing, really.

- The famous ""Characters are more intelligent now! They're aware with their environment"" is completely **** They're no real upgrade of the dialogue system, villagers end-ups saying the same thing over and over again. The environmental awareness basically adds one dialogue out of the 20s they have.

- You don't get to choose you villagers. If you fall with a villager you don't want, you're screwed, as the mechanism behind a villager moving out is strange; nobody knows exactly how it works. For me, I had to wait 2 months for a specific villager, out of the 6 I don't wanted in my island, to go.

- If one of your villager move out, you have only a day to find another you want. Otherwise, the game will automatically give you a random one, too bad if you don't want him ¯_(ツ)_/¯.

- It 's been 3 month since the release of the game. The only update we had were about ""fixing stuff"" and reducing some insects spawn because player could make a lot of money with it (But they let people sell their villager for an insane amount of money; see what happened to Raymond, it's just disgusting), and adding characters that should've been in the initial release of the game (Redd and Leif).

- The craft system is very basic. You can't even craft multiple object at once, or use materials stocked in your house directly in the craft system.

- It seems there's less insects and fishes to capture. Gyroids have been completely removed from the game. You read that right.

- The game has a ""story"" that you can reach in about 1-2 weeks (because the game makes you wait one day each time you progress). When you finally reached that goal, the credits play, and it feels like there's nothing else to do in the game. Because there's nothing else to do in the game.

- There's even less interactions with Nook and Isabelle than the last game. I thought it would be time for Nintendo to let players know Isabelle and Nook better, but no.

- Speaking of them, they do the daily announcements every time you launch the game. After the completion of the main goal of the game, Isabelle will, EVERYDAY, says that there's nothing to say, unless you have someone move in/out, or a special event.
Basically, this feature is useless after spending 1-2 weeks in the game.

- The RNG behind the crafting recipes is broken. It's like the game doesn't want you to learn new items to craft. For weeks I stumble upon the same crafting recipes everyday. This is even more infuriating when the recipe you earn is composed of other recipe you don't have.

- The whole Island Terraformation was a great idea, but badly executed. You can only terraformate one cell at the time. Your island is about 100*100 cells. It'll take you days before you reach your terraformation goal.

- Remember when you could invite villagers to your house? Forget that. It does not exist in this game.

There's a lot of thing Nintendo could have done to polish the game. There's a lot of features that are missing from the previous games, a lot of characters that are missing too.
The game doesn't seem finished, nor polished in any way. In 3 months, we had ONE update with 2 characters that should've have been in the initial release of the game.
Nintendo doesn't seem to care. but since the game is one of the most sold game of all time on switch, I don't think they'll continue to update the game with new characters and upgraded features.
The hype killed the game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
GameZmaster43,01-06-2020,"It’s absolutely appalling the design decisión from Nintendo not only making the one island per switch but also making only the first player the citizen representative. I was not the first player to start it up even though I bought it and now I’m stuck in the story. There are people that say this has always been the case, well that does not mean it’s right, it’s greedy from Nintendo for trying to get me buy another switch for another familiar member.

Factor in the decision of one island per console and you can easily jump to the conclusion that nintendo wants every engaged player to own a console, and since the Nintendo switch sits on a price range that’s way higher than that of the Nintendo 3DS this is just absurd. If you’re alone the game is fine and perfect, if you share the console with other people the game will be cool just for the first player, and utterly boring and discriminating for the remaining players.

Also why do you get hourly music later in the game? Hearing the same track for the whole day gets really irritating. Also I don’t really like the piece of music, but that is a me problem.

Clearly the best Animal Crossing game in my opinion, you can do so many things and I'm having a really good time with it and with my friends. And did you go to the museum?! It is incredible, damn! I give the game a 9/10 for sure, but 10/10 is for counterbalance a lot of stupid rates ;)",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

whoaskedhim,29-03-2020,"I share a Switch with my fiancée and we bought this game knowing about the co-op and single-island-per-console restrictions, but we were naive about just how much these restrictions would affect gameplay. In every possible way, Nintendo has designed this game to be a single-player experience. Just sharing the same island sounded bearable, but it turns out that EVERYTHING in this game has to be shared, zero-sum style. All the daily spawning resources? Only one player can take advantage of them per day. All the first-time awards for donating or developing the island? Only one player get the rewards. If one player happens to play the game more often than any other sharing the same console, there will be very little gameplay left to enjoy for the others. Nintendo has done this purposefully, betting that the pain inflicted on the players would be enough to justify buying more hardware and game copies. In our case, it has just soured us on their brand. Shame.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

ImRavs,23-03-2020,"Although the game has only been out for three days so far, I can thoroughly say this has brought me so much joy. As a long time fan I can say this is a very faithful and innovative title in the series. The big pros introduced in this game that I see clearly are the introduction of crafting, innovations to both indoor decorating and new outdoor decoration, and freedom to build your town how you like it with the moment of buildings introduced. There are many other pros too, such as character customization, the beauty of the game (especially seen in the museum), etc. However, the game does have flaws. The tool degradation feels like complete annoyance rather than sense of progression and challenge it should, which is only worsened by the crafting system lacking depth due to the only 8 or so crafting materials ever used. This makes it feel very monotonous to craft things, as it would require more resources than your small island can provide, which leads you to go to other islands (Using Nook Ticket) to get resources, which can become very tedious and somewhat too easy after your first few times. The game’s pacing feels extremely slow compared to other Animal Crossing games, which does hurt when you are so limited in the beginning. Other criticisms such as it lacking gyroids (present since AC:Population Growing) being missing, a somewhat lacking roster of new villagers, fish and bugs feeling too easy to catch now, and the dreaded 1 island per console issue do bring the game down however. One criticism I don’t believe is valid is the introduction of holidays through updates, as they would be added by the time normal players would get there thus the only people who would complain is the time travelers, which is debatable if that’s cheating or not. Overall, I believe this is a great evolution of the animal crossing formula, with many small flaws that are common across franchises when such a large gap is between entries which is to be expected. I would recommend this game to any previous Animal Crossing fan and anyone wanting to come into the franchise for the first time.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

El__,24-03-2020,"Been playing since the day of release and I have to say, it's a truly amazing game. There's new things to do everyday. The game is beautiful, graphics are amazing.
I specifically enjoy that the game takes a longer time than normal games to 'complete'. This makes it seem more worth it, you can play for longer without having nothing to do.
Regarding the multiplayer, I have tested playing via online and local play (not on the same switch) and the experience was really fun. Just as a notice to anyone who only has one switch, you can only have one island.
Gameplay is incredible. Costumization is amazing! Overall 10/10",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Denvers,24-03-2020,"Firstly, i would like to say, this is a game I would totally give a 9 or a 10 if it weren't for some HUGE issues. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a FANTASTIC single player experience and is the best game in the installment by far. The game is charming as always and the new crafting mechanic adds so much to the game as a whole. Now, instead of catching bugs, fishing, and gathering fruit to sell to buy items, you can make your own tools and furniture. Another great addition this game has is the deserted islands you can visit. You are allowed to visit small, deserted islands and gather as many resources there as you can hold to bring back to your island. This helps lower the time it takes to gather enough resources to build a new building or upgrade an old one. Nook Miles is a new addition as well - a currency that you get just by doing things like catching bugs, chopping down trees, and selling items for bells! This makes doing simple little things rewarded. Nook Miles Plus allows you to do simple tasks like catch 5 bugs and then adds a new one right away for you to complete. Here's the main issue with the game - for each copy of Animal Crossing you own, you can only have ONE ISLAND. This would be fine if it were just yourself playing, but other players can't have their own experience AND can't do a lot of things in the game if they don't own the island. Even if you have 2 Nintendo Switches, you can only have one island per copy of Animal Crossing you own. This makes the game so much less enjoyable for other players for no reason - Nintendo could have EASILY allowed for multiple saves. In addition to that, islands can't bew recovered via Nintendo Switch Online which was a major selling point of NSO - backups. Nintendo will recover your island up to one time if you get a new system or break your old one, but after that, you are on your own. I wish Nintendo would fix these issues, because if they did, this game would be nearly perfect. Still, if you don't plan on breaking your Switch and aren't playing with anyone else, I can't reccomend this game enough.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
thoromir825,24-03-2020,"This game is incredible. So beautiful, more than ever to do, well paced. The amount of polish alone in this game would be enough for this 10 but add in the fact that it's fun, rewarding and just lets you escape into a world of beauty and serenity. It's a game for the ages. I understand there are users talking about the inability to make island progress without the work of the initial player on the island, but that system does make sense to me in some ways and they very well may fix it in a patch if that is a concern of yours. I feel for those who are in that situation but I believe the game is good enough to deserve much better than it's getting for one multiplayer system that they did not advertise quite how it works.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Aeolianmode,26-03-2020,"After playing for a week, I realized I have more fun with New Leaf. New Horizons has bafflingly removed core features that were present in New Leaf, and the pacing of progression feels artificially slowed down to hide the lack content. This is coming from an AC veteran who knows what's missing and also knows what a more fun pacing for this type of game feels like. The customization is deeper and far more fleshed out, but this feels like it was at the expense of some gameplay features. While relaxing and charming, if you want the purest core AC experience, dig up a 3DS and get New Leaf.

That would be my 7 star review. But here's the kicker. Reviewers haven't discussed this because they tend to not share their consoles with a family. As a single player I am having a good time with the game, but the inability to allow multiple users their own islands is moronic, greedy, and especially cruel to low income households.

As such I have put my score at 0 to help send a message to Nintendo. Be kind to families. Especially during a time like this, while a worldwide pandemic threatens everyone's normal life. Fix this, Nintendo, and I'll adjust my score.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Icodia,26-03-2020,"Do not buy this game if more than one person wants to play on the same Nintendo Switch. The first person (1P) to start the game is the only person who can advance and actually play the story. Anyone else playing is a limited resident, they can’t even help out with the main story objectives. If you’re not the 1P, you won’t get as much access to getting Nook Miles, opportunities, or DIYs and you lack a lot of experience/fun that the 1P gets. Having to share a island is kinda fun, but when other people can’t contribute near as much as the 1P it’s unfair. The multiplayer mode is awful too. It’s a leader/follower style so if you’re the follower, you can’t access your inventory, collect things to your inventory, or travel together. I don’t understand the point of multiplayer when the other players can’t do much.Both players should equally get to play normally on multiplayer.

I love animal crossing, and bought New Horizons with the intention of playing it, and getting my fiancé into the game since she's never played. Soon after we discovered that she can't have her own island, make progress, or contribute to goals whatsoever since I launched the game first. She was excited to play the game, but now she's just sad and disappointed that she can't An option when starting the game on her profile should have come up. ""Would you like to play your own save on your own island, or would you like to be a glorified visitor?"" The other complaint that I have is that the online functionality requires you and everyone on your island to stop what you're doing and spend the next minute watching the person arrive or leave. You can't do anything while its going on and you have to watch it. Totally slows down and puts a massive break in the flow every time. Other than that I've mostly enjoyed the game.

Clench,29-03-2020,"1. Only one island per Switch. That seriously sucks, but isn't the end of the world.
2. Only the ""Resident Manager"" (first player to start the game) can progress the story. This doesn't jive with #1.
3. Tools break. Fine. Fishing rods break. Okay... Watering cans break. Wait what?
4. Cannot create multiple tools at once. This doesn't jive with #3.
5. A little confirmation and animation plays for every single thing that's made. This doesn't jive with #4.
6. Flowers need to be dug up now in order to be moved, using a shovel that, oh boy, it breaks. Again this would be more acceptable if it weren't for #5 and #4, but now it's just a pain in the ass.
7. You can cross rivers using a stick! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.
8. You can climb cliffs using a ladder! Cool, but first you gotta equip it. Why not just make it automatic with some unused button? Because it's gotta be a chore.

This game is a goddamn chore to play after the first day or two. This is mostly due to the new DIY mechanic and the ungodly amount of steps required to gather materials, make tools that break in 5-10 minutes of use, traverse the terrain, etc. Are chores fun? Not normally, no, but the professional reviewers seem to think chores are a blessing. This game, unlike previous titles in the franchise, feels like a tedious chore. Do you like chores?

And hoo boy that friend visiting wait time, good god. 1-2 minutes of waiting, when downloading the data of a friend's island would take, at most, 2-3 seconds on any halfway-decent connection. Why was this added? It's fine to see once, but every single time? Five friends visiting each other's islands will lead to everyone waiting for at least 25 minutes in total, sitting there, doing absolutely nothing.

FelisMoon,26-03-2020,"I wanted to like this game so much... but it has severe issues, enough to make it unplayable, to make a full review of the issues without spoiling even a thing. Well, here is the first issue. You can only have one save game, one save slot, one island in the entire console. You are forced to share the island with the other users playing in your console. You change something in there, amd it will change for everyone on that console as well. A bit crappy, because there is a lot of people that preffer to put dedication or enjoy to play alone or just preffer to not have their kids messing with the island and the things youve done but it can be tolerable. Except its not. Because the game implements a system where the first player or user that plays the game, is a ""leader"" that consists of granting progression lock to all other users. What do i mean? It means that if the leader player hasnt played trough some part of the game, no one else can ... it hears like a joke, like, havent you thought the leader player could just abandon the game and force everyone to get stuck? Or just not play as often and delay the hell out of the other users? This game seems promising, but so many stuff limit you for no reason whatsover really, who thought it would be neccesary to force everyone to share one single save game, and at the same time lock the progress to all users except the one who first booted up the game? Yeah, because its not the user who bought the game but the one who plays it first. And yes, you guessed it, there is no way to change this ""leader player"" unless you delete all save game data and let the game as new and unplayed.

i feel that nintendo hasn't put much thought into the fact that the switch is a console which has multiple profiles, also siblings tend not to want to share saves which will lead to arguments. to make all of this worse even though up to 8 players can play on one island only one of those 8 ( the first player to begin the game) can actually do anything of significance.

Mishawak,28-03-2020,"Have been in the animal crossing fandom since the gamecube release. Me and my boyfriend bought a switch two years ago for the sole purpose of having a console to play on should they release a new animal crossing. When it was finally announced we were thrilled, mostly thrilled for multiplayer as we had always had to play at separate times in the past. This is not a multiplayer game. Only the leader gets access to normal features of the game, and you have to frequently switch out to get anything accomplished. You can’t fish at the same time because not enough fish spawn when there are two players, so you must take turns and decide who will catch what. Not only that, but I later learned that because my boyfriend was the first player to create an account, he would be the only one to get complete access to all gameplay. This means for any exciting developments, I had to wait for him to get on and get them done for me. As someone who plays more often, this is not too great for me. I love the game and the new features they have included, but it seems like they designed this game so you would absolutely have to purchase a second console and second copy just to get the full experience you were intended. I’m very sad as me and my boyfriend essentially have to fight over who will be the leader and it creates the opposite of a smooth playing experience.

pros: cute graphics

cons:
ONLY ONE TOWN PER GAME. GET OUT OF THE PAST NINTENDO-- LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME COMPANY ON THIS PLANET HAS BESIDES YOU!

No cloud saves (so wait, we just need to waste years on a game with no way to back it up? wait for their low powered console to break? hahahah how about no)

can't split items stacks
can't bulk craft
tools break too quickly

gold tools are not worth unlocking or crafting! they break too. What's the frikkin point of unlocking them then? there's isn't one! what is it with nintendo and breakable crap anyway? breath of the wild had this stupid problem too. Nintendo just doesn't learn. Shocker.

no paintings, gracy, etc

Jacinta,01-04-2020,"UPDATE: we just unlocked terraforming, and it looks like this is another feature that player 2 misses out on. I don’t even care that I share an island with my bf, but the fact I can’t make any impactful changes to how the island looks sucks - I was really looking forward to creating a beautiful island but all I can do is plant flowers & trees. I can’t make pathways, bridges or terraform at all. I can’t understand why Nintendo has done this Like many others here, I’m really disappointed by the restrictions of player 2/ any player that isn’t the founder. Me and my bf got this game to play together but soon found out player 2 can’t make any executive decisions, doesn’t have access to any of the quests, can’t place buildings/infrastructure, and ultimately misses out on a lot of the story. This sucks!! It means one of us misses out on the full experience of the game. This is unfortunately not rectified by the option for co-op play, which is just a joke. Co-op works by having one ‘leader’ that can play as normal, and then the ‘followers’. The followers can’t access their tool wheel, inventory or leave the same screen as the leader, which just results in really boring gameplay. The follower is just essentially reduced to being a pack mule for the leader, and unable to really contribute in any way, as it takes so long to cycle through your tools to really be able to do anything. It sucks because it would’ve been SO fun to play together co-op, but Nintendo really missed the mark with these limitations. The only work around is to get a new switch and second copy of the game, which is ridiculous! It’s such a shame because playing the game solo has been really great, but the fact that you have to buy multiple consoles for everyone to get the full experience of the game is just terrible, and for that i can’t justify giving this game a good rating",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

ElPsyCongroo,26-03-2020,"I was really looking forward to this game.

However, there is one terrible and well documented caveat: ONE ISLAND PER SWITCH.

The year is 2020 AD, and Nintendo who claims to be the most family-friendly console in existence has made a terrible decision fueled by their corporate greed. I wanted my wife to play this game too--but she can't because she'll be a glorified second class citizen of my personally created island and will be unable to make her own full progress and island creations unless we purchase another switch exclusively for her to play, plus another copy of the game.

I continue to question how people are not as bothered by this as they should be. The level of greed in this company has officially reached EA levels. Imagine, being a parent and having 3 kids who share one switch--guess what? They're screwed because kids aren't known for being agreeable; messing with another kid's landscape, or building in places where another kid may not want structures, the list goes on and on.

Nintendo fanboys will defend this decision (that was made in the interests of their corporate overlords; not for them, or you, or me) as ""normal"" in the animal crossing universe or as an overreaction by those affected by it. Guys, these are legitimate concerns and perfectly good reasons to be angry! I cannot think of another game that requires me to purchase another console if I want to share it with my household; because that's the reason console profiles are a thing since last gen consoles.

It is highly unlikely Nintendo will remedy this ridiculous situation. However, it is 100% fair for people to express their disdain by using this platform to voice their reasons for giving the game a 0. Our complaints are just as legitimate as the ""critic reviews"" who gave this game a 10 (despite the obvious limitation at hand which seems suspect, maybe those reviews are paid, who knows?), as well as voting with their wallets--for some however, it is impossible to vote with their wallets if they've already purchased the game and have no recourse for a refund (which is pretty much everyone).

It's extremely annoying that there's only One island per switch. And to top it all off, only the first player can actually even do anything on said island. I love this game, so much I wish I could make a second island to make it completely different from my own! And besides my issues, there's a Ton of people out there who's switches are in households. Households with more than one person. Imagine a family with twins, or siblings, who get this game. Only one of them can play. And yeah, sorry but not everyone can **** afford two or more consoles.

And to my second point: the tediousness. I don't generally mind games being grind-y. I playing monster hunter for god's sake. But having to craft each fish bait individually **** SUCKS ASS. I appreciate them at least giving a fast forward on the crafting cut-scene, but having to go through it + all 5 menus just to craft one item at a time is FLAT GARBAGE. Not to mention it's just time consuming in all the wrong ways. Want to make a good fishing rod? Well guess what bud, you don't have a recipe for 5 sticks and 1 iron, YOU HAVE to go through the cut-scene twice because for some dumb **** reason nothing is streamlined.

It'd be such a better experience if you could A: Bulk Craft items like fish bait, and B: Have not just 'upgrade' recipes but also streamlined recipes where I could just make a fishing rod straight up with 5 sticks and 1 iron, the same amount it costs already, without the hassle.

Nothing except upgrade your house. An obvious attempt from nintendo to get people to buy more switches. In the past you could switch out you save card, you cannot mess with your saves in this game. You cant even send your data to the cloud to switch off saves because nintendo doesn't allow cloud saves.

Chucklenut,24-03-2020,"Nintendo has a knack for releasing one-of-a-kind, otherwise fantastic games that are dragged into the mud by one or two miserable 'features.' New Horizons delivers almost everything that was promised but pulls its hand back on one feature- multiplayer. While the limitation of ""one island per Switch"" was announced prior to launch the limitations forced on players not the ""island representative."" All progress on the island, such as crafting recipes, buildings, and public works are locked behind the first person to play the game on a system. Secondary players likewise do not receive anything from progressing the game's 'story' such as awarded crafting recipes, items, money, or any unique character dialogue or cutscenes tied to them, such as when completing the museum or town hall. Local multiplayer is likewise gutted, with the camera, inventory, and NPC interaction being tied exclusively to the session's ""leader."" Online multiplayer is not much better, being essentially the same as New Leaf's without its mini-game island or any equivalent, which was a good portion of the online content for that game. These make for an extremely underwhelming and downright frustrating multiplayer experience that is difficult for even the most easily entertained to enjoy, which is particularly upsetting as the game, at its core, is extremely fun and almost everything you could hope for from an Animal Crossing game.

I have my doubts Nintendo will address this issue. They have ignored other key product issues, such as Joy-Cons drifting and poor online services, to burying their head in the sand and hoping it'll blow over. I sincerely hope that they are not successful in skirting responsibility on this one- this is a decision made out of pure greed to sell more Switch systems, that thankfully, could not have been made at a worse time.

no1interesting,24-03-2020,"I want to give this game a good review. I really do. However, the one island per console thing just kills the game for me. I was totally ok with sharing an island with my spouse, but we don't share the island. Everyone who starts the game after the first person is a glorified visitor. I realize this was a thing in older animal crossing games, but as far as I know, you could at least buy a second copy of new leaf if you wanted to have your own experience. Tying the island to the console instead of the cartridge is just ridiculous. If Nintendo decides to fix this then I will be happy to write a new glowing review. As far as I can tell if you are the only person in your household interested in playing then it's a great game. As for my score: I know a lot of people are arguing that it's unfair to review bomb because ""we're not complaining about the actual gameplay"" but i watched every official trailer and Nintendo Direct about the game. Nowhere does it say your experience may be limited if you share a console. I understand that it was like this in older games. But not all of us played the older games. To for some people, this is their first animal crossing and something this knuckleheaded can actually ruin the franchise for them. My 0 score is my plea for Nintendo to at least patch it so each unique cartridge can generate an island.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

ShoujoWitch,25-03-2020,"Hi, I'm a lifelong Animal Crossing fan who made a metacritic account just to leave this review. I've faithfully bought every nintendo console, and every Animal Crossing game, and New Horizons was no exception. Leading up to the launch I was hesitant and skeptical, but still full of hype and excitement. As the game started nearing towards launch I started getting worried about the lack of content shown, and the rumors of removing gender-related content.

Indeed it seems both worries ended up being genuine and it turns out that New Horizons has received *massive* cuts compared to older games. I'll start with my chief complaint which is that the ability to play as a girl has been removed entirely, at least to my knowledge. There is a ""gender"" option at the beginning of the game which does nothing, and characters misgender you regardless of what you pick. Feminine walk/run animations were removed entirely. Likewise all gendered comments (including compliments) were removed. The game makes no reference to gender at all to the point of misgendering people. The option is basically there to lull you into a false sense of security.

Most of the game's content is locked behind weeks worth of waiting, which is particularly bad for an AC game but not unprecedented. The game shipped without *any* holidays, and requires online connectivity to access such content. More or less every major Animal Crossing character has been cut from the game (including Redd, Katrina, Brewster, Harriet, Rover, Kapp'n, etc.). Despite AC usually being about freedom of choice, the game pretty much railroads you for the first several days (as opposed to the usual quick tutorial sequence). It's already been almost a week and despite going at full pace, able sisters are nowhere to be seen (they come after about 2 weeks, instead of the usual which is being there immediately)..

Patterns are ""back"", but not the way you'd like. To get full use out of it you also need a 3DS and copy of New Leaf, so that you can make certain patterns inside of that game, make a QR, then get your phone, scan the QR, making sure you pay the monthly fee for Nintendo's online service. Only *then* can you get every type of clothing in the pattern maker. NH lacks certain pattern options so you have to scan them in. There *is* a few more options which is nice, but it's not as much as I'd hoped.

Art is removed entirely as redd is gone. Gyroids are gone entirely.

The positives of the game are the nook miles system, which I wasn't very excited for despite it being a solid addition, and the crafting. Crafting is fun, but is just the usual furniture system albeit with an extra step (collecting resources) which means the process to collect furniture is now even *slower* than before. The game is lacking in content and to make up for it they drip-feed the existing content at a snails pace (much slower than previous entries).

I really like that you can send letters to IRL friends without having to visit their town, which makes the letter sending feature actually useful. Terraforming seems cool but is end game so I don't have that yet. My complaint about AC: New Horizons is the exact same complaint I had about Zelda: Breath of the Wild: it's a great engine, but there's no game there.

All in all what i usually come to Animal Crossing for is an affirming creative space where I can be myself and talk with the virtual npcs who can act as affirming and supportive friends. You won't find that here. The villagers in game have repetitive stale dialogue, misgender you and your IRL friends, and are very lacking for the first week (you only start with 2 and get a third after almost a week in). On the plus side the animations and actions they can perform are much more detailed and involved which is great.

All in all this feels more like an animal crossing engine with injected transphobia, sexism, and hate. If you're looking at animal crossing because it seems like a cute welcoming game where you can get creative and relax.... you're better off with New Leaf, as New Horizons is just kinda a let down. I know looking back I'll probably revisit NL rather than NH. Perhaps I missed something? This may be the last AC game I buy if things continue like this.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

I was wrong.

Not only do you get limited to a single island per switch (which is a bummer, absolutely unacceptable in 2020, but I knew that going in), but the game is only for the first person to create the island. That's right: if you're the second person to jump in, you can't do anything. You essentially walk around aimlessly. What an absolutely garbage system.

It becomes boring repeating the same routine every day and it drags.. I miss the mini games we could do in new leaf being on that island and collecting medals. I also miss doing favours for villagers. I’m quite disappointed as I’ve waited years for this game, it’s too slow.

The crafting system is just dull, smashing rocks and cutting trees over and over spoils the fun and becomes more like unwanted chores. You have to carry the gatherings in your pocket to craft them which takes up too much room and it doesn’t link with your storage which is silly.

The only issue with this game in my opinion, is the fact that the updates are...
You know, I would have been happy if they delayed the game in order to get the entire game packed into the base game. All we got is a game that is fun at the start, but gets boring because it's early-access.
That's about it. Pick it up if you love Animal Crossing, but New Leaf is superior in every way (excluding graphics).
Old review: This game is a masterpiece. It's a game you should ALWAYS buy for your switch no matter what. You can never get bored of it, and you can get so much hours off of it easily. There is so much to do in the game, and there is always something to do in it. You can customize the look of your character, your island, your house, and you can get villagers! This is, without a doubt, one of the best Nintendo Switch games.
So, you may be asking, why does this game have a 7.0 user review, and why so much hate? Simple, immature review bombers putting 0 on the damn game because of one **** con about it. Don't be surprised, they're just mad because they didn't do research, wait, didn't Nintendo tell us about it, and wasn't it like this for the past AC games? I respect disliking that dumb feature, but don't give this game a 0 just because of that, actually try playing it for a while first.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
JonesCanada,21-03-2020,"Early play review: the first 8 hours are great. We have 2 players on our system and in my opinion as long as you have the primary player set up the island it works great. My wife has about 8 hours in the game, I have about 6.

Sharing an Island thoughts:
So far we both find it excellent and have had no issues with sharing an Island. I should qualify the review by stating that I played the GameCube version extensively and put some 80 hours into the 3DS version so I haven't played all iterations of the game. Still, I have no issues with two people sharing an island as long as the primary player initiates it so player 2, 3 and 4 aren't held back.
I always enjoyed the shared experiences of animal crossing. How one player would teach the computer characters specific words. You and your siblings arguing over who ran over all the flowers. Competing to get rare fossils first. To me that was the fun of the game. Personally, I think so long as you aren't a control freak this is more fun forcing multiple players into a shared space.

Actual Game Review:
I love it. To anyone who has played the game before this is a natural progression. If you feel you are ready for a new instalment it appears to have everything you would want. If you haven't played before you need to be prepared for what the actual game is. Professional reviews would describe it more articulately but it is a basic communication game. This may sound like one of those mobile games where you have to play every few hours to harvest stuff and trade things but the design predates that genre by several years. Animal Crossing is a game where you basically hang out on an island with NPC's who you chat with and just hang out. They are like virtual friends. They learn your speech and are happy to see you. You gradually develop the island by changing the landscape and adding little customizations all around. These are all small almost mindless tasks but it gives you a felling of touching up your home. You can also visit friends islands which is much easier in the modern age of the internet than it use to be. It is all fun in a passive sort of way. The game is ideally played for around 15 to 30 min a day every day for years. You do a few tasks and watch how the world changes with the seasons and holidays. Slowly collecting things and changing the world. I imagine some of the negative reviews are people trying to marathon the game because they are stuck inside due to the virus outbreak. You can play for hours a day but that probably isn't the best way to enjoy things as the game clock is part of what drives progress. If these things sound pleasant and fun you might like it. Animal Crossing really is an acquired taste but I am happy to say that the format still has life left in it after all these years.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

But in the other hand, not being able to experience full game with a secondary account... thats so bad, finally feel like farming materials for the main account, like, if the owner of this main account is not playing, you have to connec to his account to trigger new events and follow with the story.

Of course, this only poses a problem if you are sharing the Switch system, or want to play with your loved ones while having an equal experience.

I share my Switch with my 9-year-old sister and we both want to have different islands, different progression, different furniture but we simply can't because of Nintendo. We even had to restart the game completely because I let her start the game first (I am 24 years old, I could play some other thing in the meanwhile) but then we realized that only she could really make the game advance and complete missions while I just could watch, so she agreed to restart the game so I could be the major with her help, but this shouldn't be the way.

She wanted to have her island so she could play whenever she wanted and I wanted to have mine too for the same reason. Now both have to share resources and we have to agree where and when to build important buildings such as the museum when what we wanted really was to have one island each other then visit the other one's island when we wanted to see what we were doing. I think that allowing to have different saves on a single console is not that difficult in 2020 so... c'mon Nintendo, don't be as always and let the players choose how they want to play instead of you enforcing things like this because I paid 60 freaking euros for the game and I want to play the way I want.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

Pikkewyn,22-03-2020,"I mean, I kind of understand why most of the negative reviews are just against the one island per console thing that also happened with the rest of the entire franchise and that was clearly said in the AC Direct and in the back of the game box, cause it's still a bad thing. I get why people are punishing the limitations of multiplayer cause it was one of the main things in every trailer/announcement and in some aspects it can be really poor. But I just can't understand all the 0/10, especially the ones saying it's like a HD New Leaf.

Are we playing the same game? I've spend my last three days around my island in a 4K monitor and I think it's one of the prettiest games I've ever played. Every franchise has its style, you can't make this game with the details of Red Dead Redemption 2 because you could destroy what AC means: simple but cool relaxing folky ambients to spend your life on. New Horizons maintains the style of the saga with new and more detailed than ever graphics, amazing lightning and weather effects and the perfect acoustic soundtrack for a walk in the woods (plus a lot of new and reinvented features that combine very well with that ""deserted island in modern days"" feel of everything).

It came out a few days ago and I don't get why some people are asking for big things at the very beginning of a game that's supposed to be played day by day for a very long time. In the third day around the island I had sooooo many things to do I really didn't know where to start. The way you can decorate everything step by step, and the way you feel when you finally unlock every little feature... I think it's the best AC ever made, or at least one of the great ones. And for all the missing characters and features for the fans like Brewster or the gyroids it's all coming soon with free updates.

Maybe you're new and you were looking for a different experience, maybe you really didn't know it was limited to one island (which is a very bad point but it's not something Nintendo has tried to hide with this and any other past Animal Crossing game), or idk, maybe you want a Grand Theft Animal...

I expected the peace and tranquility of my own island, and the fun of sharing that island with *visitors*, hoping my housemates would start their own islands on our shared switch. The second day with this game I learned that is not an option. Not only are my housemates forced to share the same island with me, the resources on my island are shared between all of us. Anybody can move anything outside of their houses anywhere on the island. Playing local coop is completely brain dead for the second player, like bad enough that an intelligent child would get bored of it instantly. My experience with this game went from a peaceful private getaway to a mirror of the frustrating situation of being trapped in a too-small space with too many people indefinitely. If there was ever a game that can reproduce the annoyance and fatigue of sharing an apartment with 4 other people in viral quarantine, it’s this game. If you have one switch and multiple people who want to play this game, don’t bother.

Sit there and look pretty? They can pick up items, albeit slowly with an annoying animation playing each time and items are sent to the recycle bin instead of your inventory. You can fish and catch bugs, but only as long as they're on the same screen as the primary player (they are often much more spread out so there is only one at a time on the screen)The only saving grace is the fact that you can switch who the primary is by simply shaking the controllers. Otherwise this installment of animal crossing is vastly improved from the previous games, with better visuals, customisation and more quality of life improvements than i can count. In older animal crossing games i only found a couple hours of things to do per day, in New horizons there seems to be a plethora of activities to take part in with new activities opening up the more i play. The new ability to Terraform the landscape and really shape the island to my liking is a more than welcome addition and makes me feel like I'm really starting a little town of my very own! If you are playing on your own, you won't be able to find a better animal crossing experience! If you are buying this to play with a friend, however, just keep the limitations of couch co-op in mind before you buy.

gamerdad83,24-03-2020,"1 island per console is a fabricated limitation that destroys the experience.

Even IF you wanted to buy multiple copies of the game (think OG Pokemon Games with a single save file per cart) you could have a copy of Red and a copy of Blue for each person in the family to have their own adventure.

Which, while that model was worse than traditional game up to that time with 3 save slots per cartridge, it still allowed each person their own experience.

Imagine if in Pokemon Sword/Shield, another user could start a game but couldn't get to the wild area because Play 1 stopped playing at the first Pokemon center. It would be ludicrous and unacceptable.

Alas, this was an eShop purchase and I cannot return it.

I would have liked this a lot more if all of the 8 accounts on a console had their own island and you could zoom out to see the whole area, think like the Hawaiian islands, so each switch could have its own archipelago.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

For every other user who shares the switch console you are given a sub par experience. Only the first player to start the game gets to experience the whole game, complete with building shops, completing tasks for Nook, moving buildings, unlocking recipes, and generally continuing the storyline. Everyone else does not even get to help donate resources to building projects so their ability to progress in the game is limited by how much the primary player has unlocked. Nintendo is basically trying to force households to buy multiple consoles and multiple copies of the game as that is the only way for everyone to get the full experience!
The island also does not have enough resources to go around when you have to share those resources with everyone else in your household who plays the game. It can easily create tension and arguments as players fight over the valuable resources like iron that are in limited supply but are needed for crafting. I love the animal crossing series and was really looking forward to this game, but since my husband happened to log on first, I do not get to experience the game as it is meant to be.

DaRon_83,24-03-2020,"While the game itself is beautifully designed and cute looking and you get lots of motivations from what you can do. There are some design aspects and restrictions that are not worth to play the game...at least if you are more than one player.

1st critics: the menu design. If you want to buy, craft, build or sell things or just interact with objects and NPC, you have to click through the same procedures over and over and over and over again. You can´t just simply shortcut actions when done once. You can´t just hand over animals to the museum in a pack. You can´t just skip menus. No, you need to do this one after another and always go through the same question and answer procedures every time again and again. That is nonsense and game design from 1990.

2nd critics: Nintendo linked one island to the hardware and that´s it, no matter how much accounts are on the Switch. At all, Nintendo should have given the option if you want to live together on one island or everybody have its own. But being forced to live on one island is just stupid. Nintendo agued that it´s for protect against cheating. But why the **** do you do this? There´s no competition in the game. When people want to cheat, let them cheat if it´s part of their game experience. Are you the mother of all gamers?

3nd critics: it´s the worst of all and a reason to sell the game. Nintendo decided to give the full game experience just to the player who initiated the game first. HOW STUPID IS THAT. Everybody else on the Switch is not just being forced to live on the same island. NO. They can´t even do all the things that the starter account can do. Every other account on the Switch is downgraded to a worthless peasant of the leading player. Being restricted to do basic things, but not being allowed to change major stuff on the island like create buildings, modulate the terrain or doing any important action to develop the island further. Just the leading player can do that.

Nintendo, that´s the most stupid game design I´ve ever experienced in my whole gaming career of 25 years. You are forcing families with just one console to devide into one major player and everybody else being peasant players. For a NON-COMPETETIVE game that was designed to player FREE and LIKE THE PLAYER WANTS IT TO EXPERIENCE on a FAMILY CONSOLE, you ****ing idiots.

No Nintendo, you designed the game to experience it the way you want and sell more consoles. That´s it.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

ChrisLinen,24-03-2020,"So they disabled cloud saves even though I'm paying $20/year for that. Next, you can't have more than one island per console, so if me and my sister wanted separate islands, we would have to spend $360 dollars to buy an entire new Switch just to have 2 islands. Oh and don't forget that certain features of the game are only available to the player who created the island, so single player is broken for everyone except the island creator. Oh and they made it a lot harder to ""time travel"" in the game. On the 3ds animal crossing, I would set my game time 2 hours different because I like to play every morning at around 6:00 AM and my school starts at 8:00 AM. Everything important in the game happens at 8, so I just set the time so that when it's actually 6, the game thinks it's 8:00. Now it's harder to change the in-game time, so I literally cannot play the game because everything important happens while I am in school. Wow, Nintendo's first party games are getting so bad.

HOWEVER, its one fatal flaw is how greatly secondary players are hamstrung, and it's enough of an issue for us that it takes a lot of my enjoyment out of the game and eclipses all the positives.

I was the one to start the game on our Switch because I had a day off work, and therefore relegated my partner's save file to being a sidekick that can't contribute to the main storyline or placement of buildings, and is stuck waiting on whatever progress I make in the game. Even though I have the ""privilege"" of being the first player and RR, my enjoyment in the game is totally shot because I know I took the ""good"" spot from my partner.

We'd GLADLY buy a second copy of the game so we could each have our own island, but we can't afford to purchase an entire second Switch just because Nintendo can't get their act together.

There are many innovations and the gameplay has been made very motivating.

Now comes the big BUT:
You can only build one island per console and per game. That means the second player has the A .... card. We are currently playing the game in party mode on the couch together and we are just EXTREMELY disappointed with Nintendo.
How can you develop a game today that has such a bad couch co-op mode and then ask a family that everyone should buy a console and a game if you want to build your own island and not all the time like want to run one annoying tag after the other.
A split screen, for example, would have been a great idea for the couch co-op, where the second player can go wherever he wants and do whatever he wants, that should be possible without any problems in 2020.

As of the time i'm writing this review (a few days after launch), there is a dupe glitch going around that has completely ruined the online trading market. i suspect this'll be patched relatively soon and hopefully the market will level out again soon after. the game itself is very fun to play & very addictive. luckily for me, i didn't run into the island limit problem. if you're the primary owner of your switch, and don't plan on letting others use it, this game is a must have. right up there with Super Mario Odyssey & Breath of the Wild.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
explodingbears,24-03-2020,"This review is written from someone who shares a console with other users, so the review will reflect that experience. Sharing a single island amongst several other players is seriously disappointing, and leaves much to be desired. Progression and game features are severely limited to anyone who doesn't play as the primary island inhabitant. There is no shared progression toward island milestones, and key items or crafting abilities are not distributed in the same manner, leaving an imbalanced playing experience. Players who are not the first to set foot on the island are demoted to mere scavengers of resources, with limited contribution to island development. The choice to not have separate islands for separate players, and to limit the developmental experience for players that share the island, is highly disappointing, and appears to be the greatest complaint with the game. It became very apparent that this was a poor system wheat the point in the game where the first set of new inhabitants are joining the island and the primary player is given some dozen new crafting recipes and the objective of placing and furnishing several new homes across the island. Secondary players during this timeframe get none of the same recipes, are merely told to ""talk to the primary resident"" for instructions, and cannot contribute in any way to the progression aside from collecting raw materials like mindless robots. Not quite the shared gaming experience people are looking for. Certain choices like these made the experience feel extremely imbalanced and truly disappointing from the standpoint of someone who might not be the primary inhabitant. The only reason I could see Nintendo choosing to design the game in this way is to persuade people to have multiple consoles and copies of the game.

Ziphoroc,26-03-2020,"Normally Nintendo releases games in great condition with minimal issues on release. However with New Horizons I am frustrated with how rushed the game’s multiplayer functions. It truly feels as if the game was designed for only one player in mind, with the split screen added last second. The first player to play the game being the ONLY person able to make any progress to the island makes zero sense. Until you realize that it’s one island per Switch console, making it obvious that Nintendo is doing it for the money. Being the second player to play the game absolutely sucks. You can’t even pick up items off the ground and have them go to your own inventory. You have to pass leader back and forth and if you accidentally pick up something while not being the leader, you have to go retrieve it from a recycle bin. The second player cannot even open their own inventory to equip items, they have to cycle through their favorites with X, and if you pass what you want you have to cycle through them all again. It just feels completely clunky when you aren’t playing as leader. I don’t understand why they didn’t simply allow the second player to also have inventory access, even if it’s one player at a time. It also makes no sense at all why each account can’t make their own island. Even if you buy 2 copies of the game, the second copy is essentially scrap because its all tied to the console itself. Bottom line is in order to let more than one person have the full game experience, they also must purchase an additional Switch console for their self, which is extremely greedy of Nintendo to do.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Each console shares an island so if the first player does all the things, there's nothing left for the other players to do and they cannot start their own island, there is only one.

Shame on the designers or whomever decided that this was a good restriction to have. It's supposedly to curb cheating... CHEATING, in a non-competitive game. Instead it just harms the others who would like to have their own island and make their own choices. it also makes Nintendo look greedy because the only way to get your own experience in a family is to have multiple Switch consoles and multiple copies of the game.

Torokun,25-03-2020,"Nintendo has done a great job keeping the consistency of the franchise over span of decades. You have games such as Mario and Zelda where the gameplay matured with new hardwares. You also have games such as Pokemon and Smash Bros where the core gameplay has been kept consistent. I would keep Animal Crossing under that latter category.

I have no complain about the gameplay aspect. However, it is a great shame that Nintendo is keeping the multiplayer to be limited to one island per Switch. If you are going to commit to account based system and let multiplay users to have their own account, you simply can not have this approach of locking different account holders under one environment.

How awesome would it have been if you as a different user starts your own game and a new island emerges and you get to have your own experience. And you can go visit your family members' island?

madz6297,25-03-2020,This game is fantastic. It is made with love and care and is packed with new features. It's pitiful that people are lowering ACNH's user score for a sharing an island (Animal Crossing has always had every user play in one town) and having to work more to make things (remaking tools is so simple and does add to the theme that you are exploring and creating this new island). The devs have supplied us with sooo much of what we asked for (literally the majority of what people did when hacking their saves in acnl). The team listened to the AC community and they should be proud of their work ♡,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Zalabar22,24-03-2020,"While no master piece, this game is still a fantastic entry in the AC series. While it starts slow, overtime it introduces new concepts and QOL improvements that fans have requested for multiple entries. It also has limitless gameplay potential which means you can rack up a ton of hours without really trying. Some of the local options and shoddy changes hold this game back from a perfect score however, but this game is definitely worth the price of admission. The graphics are iconic and crisp and every song in the soundtrack is worth listening to.

Jamejarrs,25-03-2020,"An amazing entry in an amazing series. I love having the ability to craft and customize my own furniture, and this game gives you way more power than you've ever had to make your town exactly how you want.

Opening the gates to your island and just hanging out with friends while you fish and catch bugs is so much fun. This game came out at the perfect time given current circumstances.

I'm not time travelling, and I'm enjoying the laid-back pace of the game. Every day gives you a small task to complete and a new visitor to your island. Taking things in slowly gives you a good idea of the aspects of the island you like and what you should change later.

If you're sharing a console, the inability to complete tasks for anyone other than the first user is a serious downside, but if you're playing this on your own Switch then it doesn't affect you. My partner and I are both enjoying the game on our own islands and it's unfortunate some people aren't having the same experience.

My wife and I have our own Switches, and only one copy of the game. Mine is a day-one purchase Switch and hers is the new AC:NH themed version. We swap our single copy back and forth between our two consoles. Once we get a second copy, then we can do standard multiplayer.

Sage_the_Husky,22-03-2020,"First off let me say that the ""1 Island per Switch"" argument is completely invalid. All the previous entries have had this limitation and people are only just getting upset about it now. Population: Growing had only one town per memory card. Wild World only had one town per cartridge. City Folk had only one town per system. And New Leaf had only one town per cartridge. Out of all the negative reviews on this site (142 at the time of this review), only about 20-30 of them have actual valid criticisms about the game.

Now enough of that.

This game is honestly a wonder to play, its truly amazing how unique and fun it is and is definitely a step up from its predecessors. The graphics and sound are phenomenal. The game play is amazing. The way the game just manages to just completely soothe you and take you away from your surroundings is completely mind boggling. It's almost like the game hypnotizes you, keeping you completely focused on whats going on in the game.

The only reason I don't rate this a 10 is because some of the loading times do get rather excessive (40 seconds to load up the mailbox, however this was on only one occasion and I believe it was an isolated incident). Some of the progression is really weird and it took me a second to actually figure out what to do and unlock all the tools and whatnot. I am mildly disappointed that they don't let you explore the entirety of the island right away but I actually believe its necessary to help teach new players how to play the game before completely letting go of their hands and leaving them free to their devices. Also I do agree that the couch co-op does kinda suck in that its incredibly limiting for player 2. Don't listen to the ""1 Island per Switch"" people, imo it isn't really a valid reason for rating the game a 0 out of 10 since its always been this way. Hope this helps!",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
moomoozain,23-03-2020,"I don't understand why people are giving this game a 0 because of the lack of a feature that Nintendo said would not be in the game previously and that was not in any previous Animal Crossing games. I can understand that it can be bad for families that share a switch, but you shouldn't expect a feature that was denied by the creators of the game. Also, you shouldn't disregard the rest of the entire game and give it a 0 for one reason, you should still base your review on the other parts of the game, too.

As for my review, I obviously can't say how good the entire game is based on my 3 days (unless I time travel), but it's been amazing from what I play. There's just so much to do, and I never find myself feeling like I did all I could for the day. There are also so many things that make the quality of life so much better. Some of these are simple things, like items automatically stacking or bells automatically going into your wallet, but there are also larger changes like the tool wheel. The game is also a lot easier to play for longer periods of time compared to New Leaf because it's not on a tiny 480p screen (not to discredit New Leaf, that is also a great game). Overall, I can't say how good the full game is, but I can definitely give it a 10 based on the 3 days I've played through.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Barbolanero,24-03-2020,"Let's begin by being extremely clear: this game is amazing. It deserves all the praise you've heard about it. It's fun, it's innovative for the series, it's really zen and, most importantly, it still conveys that sense of belonging to a community when playing.
You probably are also reading a lot of angry people saying that the game only allows one island per Switch console, and not per Switch user. That is correct. I agree with those people that this should not be the case. And while I can see it being an issue if you have multiple kids and or other people in your household that want to play different islands, I don't think that fact alone makes it deserve a bad score. Since that's about the only thing you'll read in the negative reviews.

What things do I like about the game:
-Graphics are gorgeous and cute
-It's fun and adorable
-It really helps out relieve anxiety}
-It has steps taken into making sure other people can't destroy your island with the Best Friends system

What things I don't like about it:
-The multiplayer is a bit strange, specially to connect online to other people (but not a whole lot of an issue either)
-The 1 island per switch is not ideal

All in all, this is a 10/10 game. If you're the one player in your household, go for it. If you share the switch with someone else, maybe do a bit of research first and see if the restrictions are good or bad for your particular case.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

There is only one shared island per Switch (not cardridge - switch) and the player that happens to be the first on the island is the only one that can basically ""play"" the game! The others are considered villagers and are more like active spectators, than actual players. There is no way to interact with quests or progress in the game if you are not the one person starting the game. My GF and I wanted to share this game, instead she is playing it 95% since I can not experience or progress the story at all.

While I do wish I could have my own island on the shared system I use, I understand it's in the same style as how animal crossing has been done in the past. It would be terrific if they added multiple islands as a possible update, but it doesn't make or break the game. The resources for the crafting system do feel slightly iffy, as rocks seem to only spawn once per day and it takes fruit two days to reappear.

Splicex,24-03-2020,This is an incredible game for the first user to make a character. Anyone else who plans on playing only gets part of the action. Players 1 makes all of the decisions while everyone else has to wait on player 1. If player 1 isn't very active.... well too bad for everyone else. You must buy another switch for each person if they don't want to be treated as 2nd class. My family is so disappointed. We knew one island per switch was coming and we accepted that but the hamstringing of everyone but player 1 really kills the vibe. It also puts undue pressure on player 1 to make progress or feel guilty for holding everyone else back. Families don't need a game causing stress like that.

LPDani,26-03-2020,"EDIT:
Some people just refuse to understand the situation so Im going to copy it directly from nintendo support:
Is there a way to create multiple islands?
You can only create one island per Nintendo Switch system, even if you use multiple games. A different system is required to create a different island.
The island save data is saved on the Nintendo Switch system, so there will only be one island (save file), even if different games are used on the same system.

If I purchase a second system, can I transfer the save file (island data) to a different console?
Animal Crossing: New Horizons does not support the ability to transfer your save file from one Nintendo Switch system to another.

Is this game compatible with Save Data Cloud?
This game does not support the Save Data Cloud functionality of Nintendo Switch Online.

When multiple players live on one island, does everyone have access to the same places and items?
There are some tasks on the island that the Resident Representative (first resident on the island) must complete before the related features will be open to other players. For example, only the Resident Representative can receive and set up Blathers’ museum tent.
It is not possible to reassign the Resident Representative role to another player. If certain places or items in the game aren’t available for island residents, have the Resident Representative progress to the point where the item or feature is available for them, then try again.

So for people who are trying to defend this by saying this was always the case with the franchise, firstly its not true, secondly its frikkin 2020, there is literally no logical reason for not letting people have multiple save files, the only reason is to make people buy new consoles.
If you intend to play alone, lucky you, but most of us don't. Think of a couple or a family with kids, don't tell me they should buy a new console for each family member just because ""the franchise was always like this"". Im sorry, but this is just BS.

Original review: Was looking forward to play this with my wife, then I came across the information that the game is limited to one save per SYSTEM, so not even buying two copies of the game is enough, I would need to buy another switch just for this game... wtf director Aya Kyogoku and Producer Hisashi Nogami ?? why dont you want me to buy your game??",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Sazero,27-03-2020,"I thing the game is pretty good if you're the only one playing it, but i was a second player, and as a second player i give this game a 5. My sister wanted the game and she was the first one to play it, and after i started playing too, as soon as i discovered that i couldn't create a new island for myself i knew this was going the same way as new leaf.

Except this time it's worse and buying another copy of the game isn't gonna solve the problem, you have instead to buy a new switch, and I'm not really willing to spend €200 for a Nintendo Switch Lite just for animal crossing. At this point, i'd be happy even if they added multiple islands as a €30 dlc, even if i know that would upset many people, because that's something i can actually afford.

I don't even really get why this is supposed to be a good marketing strategy, since most people are just gonna be like me and can't afford another console, the only people i could see buying multiple consoles are people like famous streamers or youtubers.

Having only one island per switch would have been fine if all the players could do the same thing, but only the first player can progress, and since my sister plays a lot less than me i just feel like i can't do anything and my experience is extremely limited, and due to this i just can't really fully enjoy the game, knowing all the time that your experience is this limited for me is just annoying,

This review is based on my experience as a second player and i get that you may have a different opinion if you were the first player. If i was the first player too i would probably have the same opinion as you.

So long story short, it's not a bad game, but if you're the second player your experience is severely limited and you can't fully enjoy the game.

I don't want to sound like just another review bomber who goes like ""game bad, Nintendo < EA"", I hope i do not sound like one. Hope this sounds more like actual criticism. This is the actual first review I wrote, because i felt like i needed to share how and why i'm not completely enjoying the game.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
ocommodityo,25-03-2020,"My partner and I purchased. We realized today that the 2nd user really is just a visitor and can't progress anything. I really don't understand this logic here. As it stands one player really can't do anything in the game until the other has time to move things forward.

There are no separated save slots. It does not matter if you have a unique nintendo login. There is one island per switch and the first person to login is the only person that progresses/names the island. It even limits how the 2nd player gets items.

So completely avoid this title unless you are the sole player on your switch. This was a waste of a purchase. As it stands for a family household, it is actually $300+ to have a working animal crossing title. Well, plus having a separate online account as well, lol.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Henlo,25-03-2020,Overall a really good game but it sucks that you can't play the on same island on a secondary console.

travisfisher,25-03-2020,"I loved this game at first. My girlfriend turned me onto it as she had played the previous ones. I bought it for her on my switch as we live together and have been watching her play. She was having a blast so I I decided to join the fun! Upon starting a new player, I was shocked that I couldn't have my own island, but I thought that it wouldn't be an issue. So I joined her island and placed my tent, and started to gather supplies and fish. It was awesome! I played for 5 hours collecting all the fish I could and saving up money for the house. I figured I would help my girlfriend out and add to her projects to progress the island but quickly realized that my options for progression or helping progress were utterly null and void. I was disappointed but continued to play anyway until I could not go any further without my girlfriend (the main player) progressing forward. The next day my girlfriend and I were looking forward to playing local co-op, and I joined her game only to realize that my options for local co-op were also wholly lacking. Not only could I not access my inventory, but I also couldn't interact with anything. Not to mention that anything I picked up not only didn't get saved to my player, but it also didn't get saved to my girlfriends player; it just got shot to some community box in the Community Center. I was reduced to pretty much just following her around running in circles.

Safe to say that was the last straw. I went from being utterly enamored with the game, shouting praise to my friends, to being completely turned off. The only way for me to enjoy it would be to buy another switch for $300 and another copy of the game for $60, and I'm not going to spend $360 for one game.

The game is great otherwise, and minus the lack of multiplayer and almost disrespect from Nintendo to the 2nd player, I would have quickly given this game a 10.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Bradfordo,25-03-2020,"http://chng.it/cBh8N9py this link sends you to a petition to get more than one island per switch. If we want to make change, we are going to have to do something about it. According to most people who purchased the game and are not sharing it, they are getting an incredible experience akin to Fallout 3 (genre notwithstanding). The only reason I make this statement is due to the fact that if you are player 2 expecting to have as much fun as player 1, the second player on Animal Crossing: New Horizons is basically getting an experience similar to Fallout 76., which basically means there are no resources and no reason to progress through the game. The fact that this game doesn't allow more than one save file PER SWITCH tells me that Nintendo is trying to RIP people off, and I beware sick of these companies making decisions that try and sway people into spending more money so they can have the same experience as the other person in the house. Beware, even during a quarantine, only the first account has access to do anything remotely fun on this game. If you plan on playing this game after someone else has started an account, just be weary of the fact that you are basically getting a watered down version of the game with no replay value whatsoever. I purchased this game, and now that I started an account after my girlfriend, I basically wasted 60 bucks, and honestly, I'm kinda thinking this is a sketchy attempt at getting people to purchase separate Nintendo switch consoles just so they can have the same experience as the first person's account. Nintendo, please do the right thing and allow separate saves so I can at least enjoy this game. I purchased this game for 60 bucks, but I'm getting a crappy experience because you all took away a feature that is literally in 99% of video games.

biancadace,26-03-2020,"Honestly this game got ruined for me. Today is my sister and I’s birthday, so naturally I let her play the game first since that was her present. None of the promotional material out there warned me about the extreme limitations any player that isn’t the first player to make the island has. It’s honestly so frustrating that we spent 60$ on a game that I can’t even play to the fullest unless I purchase a new switch console.

Another thing that just absolutely frustrates me is that there is only one island per switch, making it impossible for me to enjoy the game just as fully as my sister. I’m honestly considering never touching the game again due to these really trivial and frustrating game design choices. Nintendo should patch the game to make it better if they don’t want their sales to plummet immensely in the next week.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

DutyStalker,20-04-2020,"Ok so I actually created my MC account just to review this game. I read it had been review bombed on here so bought it anyway despite all the bad reviews, after owning for a week I can actually believe there would be that many negative reviews it is really disappointing. Me and my daughter hammered Stardew valley for hours/days on end she has been so excited for this to replace it. The gfx are better and as a single player game she says its ok, but the multi player game they really dropped the ball so you can only have one island per console. At first I didn't think this was too much an issue we could both play on that island although I would have liked to have a separate island under my user account I can progress and send my character to hers it's not possible. One progressing player PER CONSOLE. Basically if you are the person playing with the island owner everything you do is pointless, items you pick up go straight in the island recycle bin. So you can switch leader but this is just covering up the fact this is equally pointless as what's the point nothing you do matters you may be able to access your nook phone as leader but then the other person's stuff just goes straight in the recycle bin instead. It's sad as my daughter is 8 she loves us playing games together she wants me to play this but it's just mind numbingly boring for the second player. The second player can pick items up they go straight in the town recycling bin so unless you want to run all way back there the leader may as well pick everything up as you are never more than a few steps away from each other as you as sharing the same screen, I basically spent hours just following her around like a dog on a lead, and every time I pick my damn bone up it vanishes into the village bin and only my owner can pick it out, following her doing absolutely nothing you can't even explore as you get teleported right next to them when you reach the edge of the screen. I can tell she's disappointed when I say you just play on your own but Jesus there is only so many hours you can spend pointlessly walking around after someone with no purpose what so ever and if you do get involved and pick some items up you have to walk all way back the town centre to pick them up and even then only the leader can access them so I pick them up we walk all way to town Square then she picks them out she even said I may as well pick them up in first place because then we don't have to run back and forth. I think to call this a multiplayer game at all is a disgrace. I'm not a review bomber just a very disappointed dad. We bought it for multiplay and we are playing Stardew valley again a week later that cost us £10 years ago. I tried to keep the review serious but multiplayer is a joke so we had 5min fun her making me out silly outfits on, apart from that I honestly have had more fun playing with the old paperclip Microsoft office assistant. Everything switch seems to be a cash cow theese days, Nintendo asking £59 for mario kart 8 deluxe still which is just a rehash of mario kart 8 that came out 7 or so years ago on their last gen console and super Mario Bros u ""Deluxe"", some crook in Nintendo saying yes let's take our old game bang deluxe on the end and re release it still for top money on the new console. I will not be buying another Nintendo game system. It's only getting 2 stars as a single player game it's alright but only one player can play single player unless you buy another switch and another game as all the other user accounts have to use the same island only the island owner can progress on. Just glad my other child is 2 and doesn't understand as I would be livid at the thought of having to buy another switch and game so he could play single player as well what a damn disgrace I am utterly disgusted with this money grabbing joke of a game. Bottom line want a fun game to play with your kids get Stardew valley or Minecraft might be old but just as good and the price is spot on value for what you get. This game replaces nothing, better yet get a Windows 95 pc and have a conversation with the office assistant. PATHETIC... PATHETIC!!!!",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
gabriot,08-04-2020,"If this game were made by ANY OTHER company than Nintendo they would have never gotten the free pass by critics this milquetoast sub mediocre uninspired trashbag of a game received.

It's one of the worst games I've played on the Switch. Where to even begin.

For starters, the completely F-U Nintendo gave to fans of people that have multiple family members that play on their Switch is just beyond excusable. If you aren't the main player account of the switch you a.) Cannot create a different island b.) Can't visit anyone online without linking and paying for a completely brand new online account and c.) Can't actually advance the game AT ALL and have to wait for the main account player to actually progress the game for everyone else. This is some ActiBlizzard level BS I wouldn't expect from Nintendo, scary sign for things that may be to come.

But even if all that were fixed it's still just such a bad game. There's NOTHING to do here! Seriously what is there to do? The crafting system is the most rudimentary I've ever seen in a game, the graphics suck, the dialogue - oh my GOD the dialogue is mind numbingly frustrating. 90% of it is meaningless, but it just goes on and ON and ON AND ON!! You just sit there pressing the ""a"" button over and over again rolling your eyes that you have to sit through yet another endless bit of dialogue that goes in circles and circles, repeating the same thing he's saying over and over and OVER AGAIN. For instance in a recent update there is a bunny that lets you know there are eggs to be found for a limited amount of time until Easter (or ""Egg Day"" as their PC overlords commanded them to call it). That's all he says in essence, but it takes 20 freaking pages of dialogue going in circles over and over again that you have to sit through for him to say it.

And on that note every single npc in this game just has literally nothing to say, like EVER. No personality, no actual tasks to be done, no real interactions, NOTHING! It's just such a bad game. How anyone can enjoy this is beyond me. Avoid it like the plague.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

Poochingus,26-03-2020,"It is hard to give this game a lukewarm score, but that is what ended up happening with this game.

From a gameplay standpoint, it is very surely animal crossing. It includes most of the features from past games, some which were lost including some bugs and fish. This is all nice. It is as expected.

The good:
-better graphics with dynamic lighting based on weather
-customization of your Island allows for making the exact town you want
-putting furniture outside for the first time
-nook miles gives daily and long term motivation to do many varied things in the game and allow for faster progress and reduce boredom
-You now progress more than just your house and the store, which gives a better sense of growth
-museum is way more pretty
-custom items are an amazing addition, custom hats, shirts, pants, skirts, face art(think adding facial hair) , and even ground tiles can be added.

The Bad:
-Made multiplayer very poorly
-multiple people in the same town cannot help add to growing the town, and can get soft locked by recipes that aren't given to them
-Island tied to your console, not the game save on the cart or even your nintendo account/profile
-you cannot transfer you Island(save data) to another console
-Nintendo refuses to provide cloud saves for no good reason(claiming to prevent cheating and manipulation, even though time travel is still possible and used heavily).
-Not enough new content. The game needed a new villager type or two. Needed way more new bugs, fish and fossils to keep me trawling the waters and carefully treading between trees. At that, different tree types would have been nice too.
-crafting only 1 item at a time. It gets tedious and annoying to craft tons of items in a sitting. No idea why I can't craft 20 fish bait at once instead of one at a time, watching the animations over and over. That isn't gameplay, that isn't fun, that isn't relaxing.
-Would have liked to see other static town NPCs make a return, especially bather's kin with the observatory and the cafe. The police dogs are also sorely missed.

This had the chance to be the quintessential animal crossing, but it failed on all fronts and just became another iteration, a fun one, but nothing special. It isn't a Smash Ultimate, but if you want a relaxing game or just a return to the series, it is adequate. Just don't expect to enjoy any multiplayer, this is a very single player game, and be sure you have the switch console you want to have forever, don't settle for a console you don't want, because upgrading either means a new console, or losing ALL your game progress.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
DJTwinz,24-03-2020,Animal Crossing is a charming game that is a fantastic upgrade from previous entries in the series. The game is visually gorgeous and adds so many details and things to discover for players. In the game the player has many options to make the island THEIR OWN through the freedoms of placing anything outside to terraforming it to your liking. I’ve already put in almost 40 hours in and hope I can keep playing for a long time. While being limited to one island may seem terrible to many seeking their own islands on the same Switch Animal Crossing is meant to be a social expierence with friends and family members. Animal Crossing is also a large game for the Switch and as the switch stores user data on the console I’d imagine multiple islands would take a large amount of space without an SD card. I’ve enjoyed playing with my family and will continue loving this game that has so much passion and detail put into it and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to relax or have fun.,10,ACNH,METACRITIC

My only issues with the game so far are:
- It’s slow to start so do everything you can and then skip your clock forward until you have the full museum and the store.

An absolutely brilliant game with 1 unbelievable fatal flaw: Having multiple players on the same Switch gates features, progress, and quests from all but the 1st player to play. Not only is there only 1 island per console (a design feature that should have been abandoned in the industry back in 1996), but only the 1st player to start the save file is designated as ""Island Representative"". Only they may talk to Tom Nook every day for quests, get various crafting recipes that, as far as I can tell, are exclusive to them, only they can place the housing for new residents, start building the museum, and on and on.

It's such an unfathomable misstep in an otherwise brilliant game. It's an easy 10/10 if they fix this, and fix it right. First and foremost, allow every player to make island progress and decisions, designating each player as the Island Representative role. Secondly, please, allow for multiple Islands per console; 1 for each player account. The *only* reasonable explanation for this decision is to pressure consumers into buying not only multiple copies of the game, but multiple Switches entirely. This is unacceptable and downright predatory. If they're concerned of people cheating and having multiple islands to farm, people already Time Travel, so who cares?

Leunam,24-03-2020,This is my first animal crossing game due to the fact that it's the first that interested me. The single player offerings and online multiplayer and almost flawlessly executed.

PapiDodo,24-03-2020,"No, no, **** no.

The most boring, overrated annoying game. Imagine if you will that you pay 60 dollars for a game where you run around collecting sticks and **** and then have to wait till the next day till you can do anything remotely interesting. Multiplayer is a nightmare to set up. What kind of game makes you wait days to weeks to be able to do 'fun' things. People keep mentioning that you build relationships with the villagers, well that's the biggest piece of whale **** i have ever heard in my life. If i read what I just told you to anyone else but didn't mention the name ""animal crossing"" you'd think that this was one of those ads you see for mobile games. You are paying 60 dollars for a **** mobile game. I will admit as far as I saw there was no micro-transactions.

I have a little sister who also plays the game. Well to my realization since she is player 1, she basically in control of the progress and I am left to do whatever the **** till she progresses things forward. I cannot make my own island. What kind of backward thinking is that? Mindless drones will tell you that the other games have always been this way. This is **** 2020, there's absolutely no excuse to enforce this. It doesn't cost them extra money, extra resources or extra thinking to get rid of this bull****. In fact, it probably costed them time and resources TO MAKE IT WORK LIKE THAT. It's a clear attempt by Nintendo to force the purchase of a second switch along with a game cartridge. Absolutely disgusting and not in the least bit warranted for what is a ****ty mobile game.

Do yourself a favor and do not buy this game. I promise no matter what reviewers will tell you, its all bull****. Do you really wanna sit for 3 hours collecting sea shells and wood to sell. All that just to achieve absolutely nothing?

Nintendo's decision to limit the actions of people playing local multiplayer is garbage. They are telling people who love this franchise to buy a second switch or go f*** themselves.
My partner bought the game for us to play together and 6 days in, they have almost 40 furniture recipes and I (who has played the same amount as they have) only have 15. The game severely limits what the second+ players can do in the game to the point of making it feel like a bad animal crossing game.
I'd even accept being able to buy all the DIY recipes the primary player receives, but at the time of writing this is impossible and player 2 will NEVER be able to build a peach chair.
It's so strange that Nintendo would acknowledge that the Switch is a console that is sharable and to be used by more than one person (Pokemon SWSH allows multiple save accounts per switch so they know several people will play each game on a single console) but turn around and make the game so garbage for everyone but the first to play it.

There cannot be cooperation to share an island if members on the island are not equals.

GoldenAbysses,25-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a beautifully crafted game that stays true to it's origins... if you're the first player. I bought this game in hopes that I could share it with my sister, but those hopes have been crushed. I started the game up first, as it's sort of tradition for the older sibling to play the game first in my family, and I had no idea that I was taking away so much freedom from my sister by doing that. When I heard ""one island per console"", I assumed that the island would be the same on different save files. Both me and my sister could transform that island into whatever we wanted. But, sadly, the grim reality is that she can't do anything on my island. She can do the basic things: catching bugs and fish, shaking trees, paying off her debt etc, but she's left out of doing anything important. Any important progress, like choosing where the buildings and bridges go, is only reserved for me. She's not allowed to have the fun of collecting resources and building our island up from the bottom, and it has ruined both of our experiences. I feel guilty personally knowing my sister, who was greatly looking forward to the game, is extremely disappointed and heartbroken at this development. She can't have fun, and I can't play the game without feeling a sense of guilt. Nintendo absolutely needs to fix this. The game itself is wonderful, I've been having a great time playing it myself, but I can't rightfully advocate for this game when it's been such a huge letdown and disappointment for my sister. I don't even mind if they keep the ""one island per console"" rhetoric, as long as my sister has the same freedoms I do.

Another issue is that the multiplayer aspect was heavily advertised but is really clunky and awkward. I was really excited for both of us to have friends on the island but you can't cross local and online play, meaning only one person can play while a visitor is on your island. Im just really disappointed because the game has the potential to be spectacular, and if you're a solo player with no other players in the household it is great, but rather than try to make the game as enjoyable as possible for everyone, they decided to make it less enjoyable for secondary players in the hopes people will buy multiple consoles.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

stana149,27-03-2020,"I'm so torn on this game. For a single player, the game is fine. It's exactly what you would expect from an animal crossing game. If, however, you share a console or what to play multiplayer with a friend, you might as well give this game a hard pass. Nintendo has once again proven to be 20 years behind on modern online features, and has implemented what I can only describe as hardware based DRM. The first player to boot up the game will automatically become the ""primary"" player, meaning that the game cannot and will not allow any other player from progressing the game. Each individual user profile CANNOT make their own game to play and they will all share the island. Yes, each switch can only have ONE island. It's not so bad if you are playing together but as two separate people playing at different times, anybody other than the first player is little more than a glorified visitor. When the first player progresses and unlocks furniture that can only be unlocked through progressing the game (save for complete rng gifts) the other players get the shaft and don't get the recipes. They have no way of acquiring many pieces of furniture. Other players can't have conversations with villagers, take progression requests from Tom Nook, or even deliver materials for a request that the primary player has already gotten. They cannot teraform, build bridges, pick out plots for houses, they can't even use emotes because a villager has to tell you about them before you can use them, but villagers won't talk to the other players.

With the amount of things the other players CAN'T do there might as well not even be multiplayer.

And this is all before mentioning the excruciatingly slow and tedious menus. You have to go through 3 prompts just to open your island up to friends. The menus function as if they were designed for a 3 year old to be sure they know what they are doing. Every. Single. Time. You catch a fish it has to zoom in, play an animation, and tell you that you caught a fish and say some dumb fish pun.

Oh and any time somebody comes to your island, for some reason the game has to take you to a 30 second loading screen. Incredibly tedious if you have more than one friend. Why can't I continue playing while they load in?

All in all the game Is held back tremendously by all the completely ridiculous and unnecessary restrictions, but that's good ol Nintendo for you. Any other company would be thrashed for the amount of ridiculous limitations Nintendo has put in animal crossing.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Happy_Specs,27-03-2020,"See, reviewing ""Animal Crossing: New Horizons"" is quite hard because you're essentially reviewing two games. The first game is ""Animal Crossing: Representative's New Horizons"", the other is ""Animal Crossing: Build a house"".

The thing is, is that if you're the representative then this game is great. You get to contribute to the island and do a lot of events, progress through the game, and just relax and have fun in general. It's a crying shame that Nintendo didn't see this extreme design flaw, because otherwise I would've given this game a 10.

Normally on the Nintendo switch, you can play one game on multiple profiles, letting families and such other groups have an equal amount of fun in a singleplayer game on a single switch. Now, Nintendo had the 'great' idea to make it so you can only have one island per console. Animal Crossing treats the switch as a huge save file. Now this would be fine, if all profiles/users of the switch could contribute to the island. Well no, only the representative has any control of the island, which means any other player can literally do nothing in the game at all. This is so extreme that I had to look at tutorials to see how I could get the recipe for the axe, which turned out to be that I had to pay for it. To get the vaulting pole? I had to go onto my sisters account and give bugs to Tom Nook just so I could progress. This issue is so extreme in fact, that most of the time you'll have to pay bells to get tools, either that or wait for the representative to do something specific. Now you can probably see why this would suck for a family or a friend or couple, but this gets worse. There is near nothing a second player can do in this game other than develop their house, that's it. This game turns from a relaxing game where you can have fun and develop your island, to a house maker simulator. This oversight really nukes the enjoyment of the game.

Overall, I hope Nintendo can fix this big issue and restore my enjoyment in the game, for now though this has killed any will in me to continue playing. For now, I have to give this game a 1 due to my personal experience.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Giangi,27-03-2020,"Firstly, I would like to say that this game absolutely worth the wait. It is clear that the development team put in a lot of effort and care into each detail, interaction and activity, and is what makes this game so charming to look at and play. Secondly, whilst I understand that Nintendo are being a bit greedy with money, these review bombs are utter rubbish as they complain about something that has been a part of Animal Crossing from day one: the fact that one copy of the game comes with one town or island in this case. They even addressed this in the direct. People enjoy complaining to gain attention it seems. And lastly, this game may have its faults and short comings (as no game is perfect), but it has a good sense of longevity. It's a game you can play for years to come.

My score: 9.8/10",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

I really enjoyed getting into this game but it all fell apart when my wife logged in to have a go. She tells me we have to share an island which I thought must be wrong! It's a modern 21st century game so multiple ave files are surely standard. Nope.is meant that I couldn't collect resources she had collected to progress my game.
I completed a mission on my next go and she then couldn't enjoy the mission in her own time. This now feels like chore to enjoy the game.
As such I have deleted my data so she can enjoy the game at her own pace. Unfortunately I can't return this game for a refund, which would be my ideal solution, as it was a digital download.

4. Only the first account to move into the island will have the full experience. While the rest of people that move into the island can’t do anything to contribute to the progress the island. And will have to wait for the lead islander to do everything.
5. What’s with the removal of the gyroids?

robsterlobster,16-05-2020,"I played this game for a while and loved it, i probably put in 20 hours but I was struggling to advance the plot. I put in so much effort paying off debt and gathering resources and going to new islands to invite people to come live on my island and still nothing. Later I discovered I was missing a ton of recipes that the main player of the console also had. WELL! that was 20 hours wasted because apparently the second player on this game has no responsibility, can't advance the plot, is missing tons of craft recipes and is generally seen as a much less important player. I'm done with this stupid game and I can't believe I spent $60 on it. pisssseddddd

Edit: I deleted the game, started over as the main guy, played for a while...even at its best this game is boring and shallow. The characters are all cookie cutters and one dimensional, the items that you find and craft have very limited to no functionality, the game play is designed to be as tedious as possible. Still pissed I spent $60 on this game. Stardew Valley is 1/4 the price and 200 times better, thus it is 800 times better. Get Stardew instead.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
daddyro,01-04-2020,"I am saddened by this game. I was incredibly excited to play, and seeing that there would be couch co-op I was even more excited since I could share the experience with my Fiance! BUT, I was disappointed. There is a one island per console rule and player one has all the control. All materials are shared between players so if you chop up all the wood, hit all the rocks, and dig up anything from the ground... there will be nothing left for player two. Your best bet is to try and save up miles and visit a mystery island... which is annoying as hell. Player two can't help build homes and you can't trade bugs/fish between players either. This all has been very frustrating since my Fiance hasn't had much fun playing alongside me. The game itself has some odd mechanics too. Fishing and digging are hard as hell. There is no indicator that you are facing the right direction so most of the time you end up missing your target. Crafting items is a **** and a half. If you want to craft multiple items, you have to click to craft, watch the animation, then click back in to craft again. Repeat until you build as many items as you want. Super time consuming and annoying. All tools will break eventually, and I wish there was a durability indicator so you are aware when it will break. I do enjoy this game while playing alone, but it's a real bummer that we can't have our own separate islands and have equal participation. If that gets fixed and the other minor things change, I'll be happy with the game, but for now, I am disappointed.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

In order to progress in the game you need to person who owns the island to do it, making the other people playing very limited. The game itself is amazing, but the one island per console limitation makes this game not near as great as if you are playing solo. Personally i would rate it this way if you are playing solo: 9/10, and if you are playing with multiple people the experience is not near as great, and i would personally say the game is a 6/10 while playing with multiple people.

Which is really sad because Nintendo have seriously f***Ed up the multiplayer and save system. If you want the full animal crossing experience, you need to be the island representative. If you're not the island representative then tough luck, you're gonna get a pretty bad animal crossing experience since only the representative can progress the story and gain new features. It honestly sucks. Also one island per switch is a concept which should be opt in or out and having one island per switch just makes the representative problem even worse.

This honestly just feels like Nintendo being greedy. Only one person per switch can have the full animal crossing experience and if you want to have it as well, buy another switch and if you want to play together.... Buy another copy of the game which is a massive investment and one made out of pure greed.

My second issue is the fact that you have to buy the Nintendo online service to invite people on other switches to your island and to use the QR code clothing system i know it's not a main part of the game and you can still go through the game without it but im just disappointed in Nintendo for even putting a paywall behind online interactions.,5,ACNH,METACRITIC

The only issue I see with a 1 island limitation is that it is tiny with no room to expand. The big issue is that Nintendo gives one user per switch a completely different experience than anyone else who wants to play the game. I would say the new features and aesthetics are great , but they don't even matter when you have a game that is fundamentally broken at its very core. For example, I am the second player to start the game and decided to help player 1 with getting furniture for new houses. I didnt get any DIY recipes for the items needed, and when I went to check the boxes for what was needed to create houses, there was zero info. Tom Nook just told me to talk to player 1. What is wrong with the developers to make a decision to encourage collaboration, but only allow 1 player to have the resources to contribute?
I love Animal Crosssing games and have played from Gamecube to DS to Wii. This game was clearly designed to push families to purchase multiple Switch Lites, and gives the middle finger for anyone that wants to fully experience a flagship game on their flagship console. There is even a great irony and an, ""F you,"" when they actually give you a Switch console furniture piece for you starting your life on the island.

greekstallion,25-03-2020,"Absolutely ridiculous that two players can't have their own individual islands on a current gen system. There is absolutely zero reason that such a limitation should exist beyond greed. Nintendo support actually told me to ""buy a second system."" Are you kidding me? Buy a second video game console if I want to be able to fully experience a game just like my fiance on our switch? Is Nintendo out of their minds?

So be prepared, my fiance is the ""island representative"" or whatever because she played first. She gets to progress the game, she gets to name the island, she gets to build stuff. I just get to follow and wander around like an advanced NPC. Oh, and island resources spawn ridiculously slowly, so if she plays before me on what's her island that I'm pretty much a guest on, I'm just SoL unless she leaves some for me. I don't even feel like there is a point in me playing this

I'm sure she would say it's a 10/10 experience, but it's a 0/10 for me because I get some halfbaked version for my money and can't experience the full version with my own profile on the console and my own save files.

IslandCrossing,26-03-2020,"When my partner first told me about Animal Crossing, I was kind of excited. I’m from a tropical region and, while I hadn’t played it as a kid, I had played Harvest Moon, and the prospect of making my own cute farm island was a reassuring way to pass COVID-19 quarantine. The reality was not cute. My boyfriend didn’t think I wanted to play for some reason and set up the island and stripped it of all resources. I had no idea how ACNH worked so I started a save file thinking I would either get my own island or have different resources generated for my file, or like anything a reasonable designer would think of, right?
Instead of starting with a tutorial explaining what choices would be permanent and unchangable, I got a message that just told me to put my tent down. Noticing all the trees were bare, I confusedly put my tent close to my bf’s and tried to figure out what to do. After running around breaking my flimsy tools for two hours trying to get wood and stone that wouldn’t spawn, I looked up what was happening. Not only was there no way to respawn resources other players had hoarded, accidentally or not, as the non “representative resident” I couldn’t donate to the museum until it was complete and I could not build the store nor decide where it was placed. I also learned that expanding our houses was impossible if they were too close, which seems like vital clarifying information in a game aimed at children.

We tried playing for a few days but even though we were communicating it was not working out. We play video games very differently. I am impatient. My partner doesn’t like to put much thought into games or rush. I found out that I could time surf but my partner doesn’t want to do that since he is, apparently, “an animal crossing purist” or rather he doesn’t want the villagers to be “mad at him for cheating.”

For those who are reading and saying “so what you’re just not trying to cooperate” we really are and ACNH doesn’t really provide anything to help with that! There’s no shared inventory pool so multiple players can easily contribute to helping build up the town.
In order to send resources to other accounts on the same system you have to either mail them per item for 200 bells each (time consuming and not cheap x 12 items per day). Not exactly helpful. So after two days I had switched to hitting Nook miles achievements and using all my miles for nook tickets so I could actually like, get anywhere in the game without stripping the island of resources he needs to build the town. My partner was surprised I payed off my home loan before him. I told him I was using the Nook tickets like a revolving door to rack up achievements and resources. He said he had not used a ticket yet and had just bought hair styles. He was embarrassed to tell me this. I realized I was making him feel bad about his playing style just by him having to watch how I play. I normal speed through games faster than he does but he never has to play the same file I do until ACNH. We had thought this would be a fun bonding activity while we were locked in but it wound up being stressful and anxiety inducing.

The feeling we had fostered around the game was not one of shared joy and reassurance, but unease and mutual resentment, I resented that I could not run the island and build the town and my boyfriend resented seeing the rushed way I was playing since it took the relaxing element of playing away from him. So yesterday, I emptied my inventory out on the ground and deleted my Animal Crossing file. We have pretty good communication and lots of other games I enjoy so while upset, I’m know my ACNH experience isn’t as bad as it could be. I know if I was a kid ,who are the ~main group~ this game was made for, who had to share this with a sibling while in quarantine I would be crying. Even if we bought a second cartridge we can only have one island per switch system.
Half the world is unemployed for at least a month, does Nintendo really expect people to buy second and third switch systems to play one game fairly?

TLDR: I rate this game 0/10 for worsening an already traumatic experience of being trapped in my house with no control over the world, and making my partner and I feel bad for just wanting to play a game differently. Bad user experience design for no easy item sharing while demanding people share an island. This was frustrating as adults with good impulse control, I cannot imagine how infuriating it is for the target audience of children and teens.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
evan22,26-03-2020,"This game is great for one player. As dozens of other reviews say, the problem starts when you have multiple people in the house. My girlfriend was just as excited to try this game as I was when we got it, so you can imagine the disappointment for both of us when we discovered how there can only be one island. As player 1, I spend most of my gameplay feeling guilty and feeling bad about making decisions that she’s not allowed to participate in or trying to balance between wanting to do everything but not wanting to take all the resources from her. As player 2, she spends the gameplay basically just being a visitor to the island, never able to make any actual changes or shape the island how she really wants. She’s also locked out of many little tasks (such as helping Gulliver). This simple mechanic that would be easy to fix in an update has truly ruined the experience for both of us. The fact that Nintendo is trying to use this as an opportunity to sell more switches is absolutely absurd and it’s honestly really disappointing. It turned what should have been a happy and fun experience for us both into a really disappointing one all in the name of corporate greed. Shame on Nintendo.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Dtrixtreme,26-03-2020,"I made an account just to review this game. Because of my disappointment

I am a solo player who was entering this franchise for the first time. So the single island per console thing doesn't effect me, but in an era where other games can have as many procedural generated worlds as people can fit on their console hard drive...that makes absolutely no sense. And these islands are tiny.

My first impression of this game is that it forces you to play it how IT wants you to. I have repeatedly changed my in game clock on my switch just so I can progress the game, and when you consider that you can hit the first time gate in 40 minutes, it puts you in an awkward position where your first day of the game is just shaking tree's and catching bugs and fish while trapped in the starting area. I felt like I was playing an early access title.

What's worse is you are punished for your progression initially. You get locked out of content because the game decides you've done enough of it and then doesn't let you back into that system for 48 real world hours. At one stage you are not allowed to buy key items used in repeatable achievements because you are playing the game at the wrong REAL WORLD time. And this makes no sense when you consider the first version of the shop is available 24-7.

The control mapping is bizarre, the tool system, which is arguably the most important system in the game is bound to the D-pad instead of the back buttons, which is annoying when you consider that fast moving insects exist in this game and you have to stop moving to swap to your net. Also the phone being bound to ZL instead of + symbol makes no sense..The + symbol is only used to access a specific menu in the phone...The central buttons on a controllers are universally used for key menus in most modern games so why was this an exception?

To further add to the clunky issues with the game, the shop system puts filler dialog in everything, and only allows you to buy items in 1's or 5's, while some repeatable achievements require 3 of the item, so you either buy 5 to save time, or buy 3 increments of 1 just to save money. I don't know if future upgrades to the island make this simpler, but if that's the case, why on earth would game designs make players have to unlock intuitive design?

If not for the returns policy of the retailer I bought this at, I would already have returned it. I will continue to play my $69AUD investment to the endgame and may change my review depending on how the mid-late game is.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Gamer1989,26-03-2020,"Looks cool, my husband has a great time playing, but unfortunately, they only allow 1 island save PER SWITCH. So I will never know what it's like to play how I want to. Got super excited to start and was dropped on to his already populated island. A real let down. Shame in you Nintendo, you know this is a greedy tactic.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
avonkorff,26-03-2020,"This game is marketed as being multiplayer friendly, and an experience all can enjoy and share together. It is not designed as such. Unless you are a single person, or are the ONLY person playing on the Nintendo Switch you download/install this game on, this game is currently in a criminally unplayable state. Currently, whichever Switch user account launches Animal Crossing first, is the ONLY account that gets the full retail game experience. All subsequent accounts have to play a miserable shadow of the game the customer paid for.

This design oversight is so heinous, it's causing many people, including myself, to wonder if this is actually a ploy by Nintendo to get people to buy more Switch/Switch Lite consoles. As a life long fan of the company it would be pretty devastating to watch them go the way of EA, Zenimax, and so many other fallen titans in the industry.

Extended Review:
The whole world is on lockdown right now, and a fun, relaxing, life sim type game such as this sounded like a great way for my wife and I to enjoy some decompression time together. Not the case. I spent $60 dollars on the Nintendo store only to find that we had to share one island (not a problem) but that only ONE of the profiles on the switch was able to progress the story, and advance our island's progress.

My wife was the first to launch the game. I made my character and started building my only little house on the island a few hours after she had some time with the game. Fast forward 3 days, and now I find that I cannot help settle new villagers, I cannot be given tasks by varying NPCs, I cannot contribute/have a say to the layout of new buildings and terraforming on the island, and a result, I've paid $60 for the pleasure of farming materials to trade to my wife's account for use as she deems fit.

This is a wholly unacceptable state of the game and legitimately needs to be patched. I will be following up with my credit card provider tethered to my Nintendo Online account (bought the game on Switch store) and asking for refunds on the same basis that hundreds of thousands of Fallout 76 players got their refunds for: consumer ethics breach.

Nowhere in any advertising or marketing material was I given the impression that only one person in my household would be able to fully play the game. I'm not talking about a subjective ""enjoyment"" of the game...I am referencing the clear and simple fact that only one account per Switch has access to the entirety of the game that was sold for $60 USD. Secondary, tertiary, and all subsequent accounts will have a miserable, gated experience and have 0 agency over the ONLY island the entirety of the household is allotted.

Without a clear disclaimer being present prior to purchase, this is unethical and either needs to be patched or customers need to be refunded. Until either happens, this is a 0/10, awful, regrettable purchase for anyone not living/playing alone on their Switch.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Benthefry,26-03-2020,"It is such a shame that you don't get an island per account. I mean, we get along fine, and our first reaction was that it was a shame not to be able to fill each our museum, or to just fully control our characters when we both play at the same time.
Not having two islands unless you buy two consoles is greedy and is a big let down!",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
MrRenner,26-03-2020,"Horrible decisions for multiple players. I bought this game because it's the only thing my wife will play. I let her play first and now, as soon as she gets bored of it, the game will stop progressing. I can't restart the island because I want her to have the ""player 1 experience"" in the only game she has ever shown interest in. This would be fine for a 20-30 dollar title. But for a full 60 it is unacceptable.

It completely overshadows any charm this game has. And all the people saying ""its fine"" are people that aren't affected by the issue. I feel as if I was sold an experience tthat was not advertised as what it really is. It is a single player game. Players 2-8 might as welll be NPCs. Nintendo laid an egg.

Ray99,26-03-2020,"I'm not sure if this is pure Nintendo-style incompetence or unethical, malicious, money-hungry nastiness. I prefer the latter because I can't imagine Nintendo is this inept Here are the main issues which this otherwise great game which drag it down to the depths of cynical, corporate garbage.

1. One island per switch? What? Completely and utterly destroys any hopes of playing with others. If you're in a household with multiple people who want to play this GAME, think TWICE before buying. This will create problems and essentially force you to both buy a second switch (or more) if you want to have the experience. What are parents supposed to do with multiple kids who want to play? Nintendo's plan all along was to have multiple switches per household, and they are trying to implement it in the most disgusting way, with artificially installed limitations. There is NO technical limitation there can't be more than than one island per switch.

2 - Is there a way around it through coop? NO. Local coop is bare bones, pathetic, and an embarassment. You have zero agency as the second partner, basically just following along like an idiot. You cannot progress in any meaningful way. So no, this is not an option for multiple people to enjoy this game.

3 - Online multiplayer. Don't get me started. I've never seen such a poorly implemented online from Nintendo. This is WORSE THAN SMASH. And that's saying a lot. Firstly, you have to go to the airport, wade through seas of text, including the bird actually ""connecting to the internet."" Is this dial up? Then when you finally get to of a friend's island, and someone else wants to join, you will have to sit through a green message popping up forcing you to quit your menu, a FIVE STAGE flight screen for the plane to arrive (God knows why this is necessary, what is it loading??), a save screen, and a cutscene of the person walking in the airport. This happens EVERY TIME someone joints the island, and breaks up anything you're doing multiple times. Absolute lunacy. Again, not sure if this is incompetence or purposeful - Nintendo is known to hate online. This is their way of saying - Online is unplayable, don't do it, just buy more switches and play locally. Also, why are there no mini-games to play with friends like New Leaf? There is nothing to do with multiplayer online and things get boring fast. Would minigames have been so difficult to implement?

4- No cloud saves at launch. Apparently something is being ""worked on"". Why not at launch? Is it so hard? Are they so concerned about cheating? People are time travelling like crazy as we speak. They could have easily imposed some limitation like one cloud save per day. This is just mean, honestly. Pure meanness. Creates unnecessary added stress about losing your save. Apparently a download will be allowed once, but who knows if this is true. Why??!

These are just some of many issues. What is Nintendo thinking? They've been working on this since 2012!!!

Don't expect a patch. Like Mario Part, Smash, etc. there has never been a patch that improves the fundamental problems of the game.

Lord_Nep,27-03-2020,"The game looked amazing when I first heard about it. I've always loved Animal Crossing games. But this one not so much. I hate it because the first one to start up the game becomes the ""Resident Representative"" and gets to choose the island, name it, build houses for the residents, do tasks which lead to the construction of a museum and the construction of a shop, and other various tasks. Everyone who starts the game after the ""Resident Representative"" is put into the same island and is unable to do any similar tasks. As someone who isn't the Resident Representative I have to say it makes it hard to stay interested. My brother who is the Representative, always gets tasks to do while the only interesting thing I can do is pay off a loan or maybe build furniture. I have to deal with whatever he chooses to do because I have no other choice. It doesn't give me as much freedom as I expected. The game is supposed to be about how you build your own island and not about favouring someone over others. It forces the others to live on an island which is controlled by someone else. Basically, the game ignores what it is supposed to be about.

Honestly, the game is cute and a lot of fun. I just hate that I’m unable to do anything because all progress is locked to the first player.

I really like a lot of the new things that have been added, but I feel that so much of the old content that made the game feel well rounded is missing. I am at the point where I believe I have obtained every shop/ building in the game and there’s about the same amount as the GameCube game. Pros:
Fantastic graphics
Online works very well
Museum is beautiful
Fishing/bug catching is still solid
Fossils are the same Interior design system
Sending letters/presents to real life friends
Villager interactions are better
Lost items aren’t as annoying
Crafting system for building items
Nook miles system

Cons:
Only one upgrade of nook’s cranny
Very little to do other than fish, catch bugs, and collect resources A lot of beloved characters from older titles are completely gone. Only characters, other than villagers, are the nooks, Isabelle, blawthers, able sisters, and occasional merchants
No club
No garden store
No dream lounge
No kicks(he stops by town with small inventory)
No tours No post office
No shampoodle
No coffee shop
Items are very expensive for basic household things(ex:cello=100,000 bells)
One island per switch(doesn’t affect me)
Wait times for tutorial are many
Items break all the time
Crafting takes way too long depending on the item
Tedious work for resources
No tropical fruit
No hedges No swimming/diving
No ordinances
Moving buildings on island costs a lot of money and is not the easiest to get perfect Overall, I feel as if this game is just a hollow shell.

Draconequis,28-03-2020,"My sister and I share a single switch. We bought it together because we live together and we have enjoyed our games so far. Enjoying separate save files for all of the games so far on one system. We shared breath of the wild (which has a much larger map and more detailed graphics).  And now when we went to play we learn there is only one island per console.  Which means if you want to play animal crossing your own way you have to buy an entire switch. This problem cant even be fixed with switching  sd cards because the game saves directly to the switch. Does this mean that if I did buy a new switch I wouldnt be able to transfer my game save file over as well? I was planning to get a v2 eventually for the extended battery life.

Now I was willing to maybe overlook that, however this game was clearly built for one player. The first player who boots up the system gets to be the island representative. This means that all of the tool advancements, craftable recipes, and any building locations are all decided by player one. This basically makes player two a glorified npc. Not only this but I learned that you cant send fish or bugs to a friend. Which is so dumb because I purposefully chose the opposite region so I could give my friends cool things they dont have yet.

I had also hoped to have a great white shark in my room but the display for a shark is now a tiny pool with high walls and you can scarcely see the creature inside. I dont know why they decided to change the model to something that looks so awful.

If you are not the first person to play the game on a console, you become a glorified NPC that can't do anything to progress the story. Nintendo is being aggressively greedy at the expense of their players, it is absolutely ridiculous that Nintendo, a company with some of the most skilled, talented, and smart people in the video game industry made such a horrible design decision for no reason other than corporate greed.

Though if you plan to play this game alone, it is a very good animal crossing game reminiscent of the original gamecube game with many new features and an amazing story centered around building a deserted island with nothing but a few tents into a thriving, developed community. My only complaint about the story is that I think it should be (and can be) longer. The postgame, like all animal crossing games, has tons to offer as I expected, but there are a few omissions from the other games that make the postgame feel like it's missing something. There is no coffee shop, no fortune teller, no theater no barbershop, and only two shops. While the new island customization options and some other smaller features do provide some new postgame content, I don't think they add quite enough to make up for the omissions and I can't see myself playing this game for years like I did in city folk and new leaf.

McKat,28-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons- Don’t buy it

My husband got me this game bcs he was trying to introduce me to the world of video gaming. I have to say- if all games are like this, count me out. Way to go Nintendo on destroying an otherwise great game!

How did they ruin it?

1- If you’re a multiplayer household, you can only create 1 island total & whoever has the misfortune of starting the game 2nd becomes a 2nd rate citizen on the 1st player’s island. That means they can’t do any quests, can’t make any decisions, don’t get the same kinds of rewards or as many... And you’re limited in the progress you can make on the island to what the 1st player does So short-sighted!

Heck, 1/2 the time the “hot item” you’re supposed to sell is something the 2nd player doesn’t even have the recipe for. To fix this? You have to buy a whole other Switch game console. Not just a second copy of the game, which would be ridiculous enough in 2020. A whole 2nd console.

So painfully and obviously GREEDY!!!

Don’t buy it! 2- They purposefully didn’t warn anybody abt any of this anywhere on the game description, instead lauding it as the ultimate social experience. Fun for families, friends, couples... Bullcrap!!

Bcs when you’re playing with someone else, the 2nd player can’t collect anything. It all goes into the collection box. And if the 1st player looks at their storage kit or takes their tool ring out, it knocks out whatever action the 2nd player is trying to do.

3- Talk to them in the only way that will actually speak to them. Clearly the only way that actually matters to them.

Until Nintendo decides that they actually give a crap about their consumers (I’m not even asking that they care more about their consumers than their bottom line bcs at this point it’s clear that’s not going to happen), do not support them by giving them the money they’re clearly after with this disgusting decision they’ve made.

However, I am giving it 1 star bcs other than how limited the game feels, it is an enjoyable game and an enjoyable world. Even so, I probably won’t be playing it for too much longer if Nintendo doesn’t fix this. I just can’t see myself enjoying these kinds of limitations for very long. And I’ll continue telling people to not buy it- even when they’re not asking me.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
VivaLaPanda,28-03-2020,"A theoretically great game, held back by Nintendo's frankly astounding inability to design multiplayer functionality given its. 2020. Setting aside how completely useless shared-console multiplayer is, the online multiplayer feels more like it's teasing you about how good the game *could* have been if Nintendo had competent network engineers. To join someone's island, you must be friends on Switch, a process which for some reason still uses friend codes instead of usernames like literally any other platform on the internet. Then, you must click through around 30 seconds of dialogue to visit a player. You have to go through this pointless dialogue *every time*. But wait! To visit someone they have to ""open their gates"", which means going to an ingame location, and clicking through another 30 seconds of pointless dialogue. If you sleep, the gates will close and you have to do it all over again. Because of this, visiting another player effectively *always* requires communication through a 3rd party platform to coordinate your visit (no direct messages via your Switch account, sorry.)
Once you manage to exchange texts, ensure the other person has opened their gate, and go to join them, you are met with an almost minute long unskippable cutscene. This plays *EVERY TIME* you visit a friend. It locks you, and all players on the island you're joining. Once you get there, the island's owner will discover that they are now unable to place/move any of their furniture. Why? Because Nintendo has spent a solid 2 decades pretending that the internet doesn't exist, and so has no engineers on staff that can make online functionality.

The single player experience is great, but it's not worth $60. It's a fun game, but just go play Stardew Valley, it has more polish and plays much smoother than this half assed game. It's totally unjustifiable to have a game with multiplayer this bad in 2020.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Even with this restriction, I can still find enjoyment in it, but it's so hard to justify the decisions to not allow secondary players to progress the island or make their own.
The co-op is a perfect way to visualize how terrible this system is. The first player, the leader, is the only person allowed to interact with anything in the game.

After that every other person in family played on their own users. We realized that we were all located on the same island. No big deal we thought. We each played for a few hours, but none of us could figure out how to make an axe. None of us had the option. After several frustrating searches we found out that since the 5 year old started the game first, he is the only one that can really play the game. Meaning that no one on the switch can make any decisions. We had to delete all the saved data for everyone and start fresh on 1 user. This is unacceptable.

xenomachina,29-03-2020,"The Nintendo Switch has one of the best profile systems of any game console. Each player can have their own profile, and games saves are kept completely separate.

Because of this, I was very surprised to discover that Animal Crossing: New Horizons goes out of its way to circumvent the profile system. The first player to play the game is given the full experience. All other players are given a downgraded experience. Parts of the game are just missing, like naming your island, or choosing its layout. Progress in the game for all players is also gated by the primary player's progress. And all players are forced to have the same island, with limited space and limited resources.

If I'd known this, I wouldn't have purchased this game, as we have one Switch shared by two kids. How is it fair to let one of them be the ""island representative"", while the other is treated as a second-class citizen by the game?

Searching online I see others trying to excuse Nintendo's behavior here, saying ""Animal Crossing has always been like that"", but:

1. This is false. On the 3DS you could only have one game save per cartridge, but you could use multiple cartridges with a single 3DS. On the Switch you need two separate consoles.

2. When classic games with limited save slots are ported to the Switch, the number of save slots from the original are normally made *per-profile* on the Switch. For example, in Link's Awakening there are only 3 save slots. In the Switch version, there are 3 save slots *per-profile*. Likewise, one would expect that Animal Crossing would have one game save *per-profile* on the Switch.

3. Having mis-features in the past is not an excuse for propagating them into the future.

Nintendo went out of their way to make the game terrible for anyone but the first player. It's pretty clear that their motivation for this is greed. Instead, they've made me strongly consider returning this game, and avoiding their platform in the future.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Niclink_21,30-03-2020,"So far from what I have seen, I am slightly disappointed with this game. I enjoy the new features such as the nookphone and the various quality of life fixes. The new museum looks AMAZING and the graphics look amazing as well. There are, however, many things I am disappointed with. For one, many staple NPCs of the series have been cut. Brewster, Redd, Dr. Shrunk, Harriet, Pelly & Phyllis, and Katrina have all been cut. In addition, the art gallery has been entirely cut from the museum. Nook's Cranny now only has one upgrade. There are very few buildings to construct. The amount of buildings and facilities you construct would be equivalent to the amount of buildings and facilities that would be available day 1 in other games. Diving has been removed and the there are now only 6 different kinds of fruits. I am mixed on crafting. On one hand, crafting provides a new and fun way to create certain furniture and outdoor furniture. On the other hand, If you remove the crafting and the nook miles system from the game, this game would have no substance. I'll just put it this way, this is the first animal crossing game where I have had nothing to do except log in, play the game for a total of 10 mins, and sign out. Each animal crossing game released up to New Horizons was a culmination of everything great from the games previous. This is the first game in the series to regress in design and gameplay and that just doesn't sit well with me. This game was rushed and hopefully, with updates, this game can improve, but for now, this game is all style and no substance, and I'll be sticking to city folk or new leaf.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

JazziCat,10-04-2020,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU PLAN ON USING IT FOR LOCAL MULTIPLAYER (meaning more than one use in the same household).

I cannot stress this enough as it will cause you no end of frustration, headaches, angry crying and resentment. I say this for the simple fact that there is no true multiplayer function that will satisfy everything within the game. The only person that has any say or control or can actually do anything worthwhile is the VERY FIRST person to start playing the game on the console. Everyone else is literally just a slave to their whims. i can't even sugar coat it because it's caused no end of anger and frustration for my partner and I when we've tried to play together. They lost all interest as they literally couldn't progress the story, gain DIY recipes from Tom Nook, nor actually make any meaningful decisions within the Island (such as placing residents or setting up bridges or really doing anything of note at all). They have stopped playing entirely and that has killed my joy as i'll never be able to play with them all due to Nintendo's greed. For a company that stresses being the best multiplayer and family friendly console on the market they sure did a good job of tearing families apart with this title. Like they've got great multiplayer function in almost every other game, yet decided to go money hungry with this entry for whatever reason. Locking each switch to 1 Island (even if you have multiple ID's with multiple online ability, and even with multiple game codes purchased) is just terrible restrictive and straight up greedy (and i say this as they have yet to offer a valid reason for restricting it in this way so i can only make my own inferences)

Understand that I'm not really upset at locking the switch to 1 Island per switch, that actually makes some sense to me. The reason for the review being this low is the fact that they Advertise this game as a family friendly game, which it is clearly not, What is fun about being relegated to a servant of the first person to start the game? If they simply added a function to change the Resident Representative in-game then none of us would have reviewed this with such vehemence.

Think about this: If this game was purchased for a household with multiple kids or in a house with multiple roommates that all love the AC series and looked forward to playing this, if for whatever reason the 'main' person who started playing (not even the one who actually bought it because they don't restrict it to actual accounts) was not able to play for an extended period of time, either due to illness, or they were stuck in quarantine at a different location, or they simply stopped playing, then you have effectively killed all progress and joy for the remaining members of that household. NO ONE will be able to move the game forward so long as that player never plays again. That is why we are all distraught over Nintendo's decision, and have every right to rate this game as such. Nintendo never shed any light on this, because had a parent of children, or partner in a relationship known that the others they live with will NEVER have the same ability or privileges across the board then they wouldn't have purchased it in the first place. Why cause strife intentionally when we're already dealing with everything else going on in the world?

So i write this review, not to review bomb, but as a warning for all future purchasers to beware of what they'll be getting themselves into.

Now that i've said that, to validate my review i will state that until we discovered this terrible game design decision, it was a really fun and enjoyable game to play, but i will not rate it higher than a 1 until Nintendo even acknowledges this issue let alone be proactive and fix it. (A 1 because there was enjoyment at one point, but now no longer).",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

The first player who starts anything in the game is now the representative and if they quit a week later then you have to restart your entire island and progress to appoint a new representative. That could be hours upon hours of progress which you have to restart because of a broken mechanic. What’s the point of a representative to begin with? Every save file should have their own island and Nintendo should allow people to progress at their own rates. Terrible game mechanic.

However, problems begin to surface when you want to play with another person. I purchased this game to make the corona quarantine easier for me and my gf, but as soon as her character arrived at the island (I arrived first), we found out she was nothing more than a 'secondary' citizen.

She couldn't get new DIY recipes, participate in new projects, put things in the museum or even help with existing projects. Her progress was limited by mine, and since I don't play as much as her, she basically got a watered down version of the game.

This is obviously a conscious design decision on Nintendo's part to encourage players to purchase more Switch consoles, since you cannot have more than one island on the same one. This creates a TERRIBLE experience for anyone who is not the first player - I can only imagine how much this would suck for a whole house of people who want to play together.

This is similar in vein to how the online features are locked only to players with an online subscription. If they are not present - other local players can't play online, so the only way to work around this is to create the online subscriber's character in local multiplayer using another controller, and then just have them stand around, allowing other players to use online features.

I wouldn't mind buying a 2nd copy of the game but needing a 2nd switch at the cheapest 260$ per switch plus the games 80$ each for a whopping total of 680$(CAD) for two people to enjoy their own island is absurd.

I genuinely don’t understand a player focused decision other than they want to make as much money as possible off of players. Please Nintendo, fix this for the people who love the game but also want to play it with their family members and even friends because I don’t want myself or them to be forced to delete their save so that another person can experience the full game.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Conversations are repeated over and over and over again every single day! Selling items takes forever! Loading screens take forever, tasks are boring and will drive you mad from the monotonous element of it. Everything is so slow, its not relaxing slow, just frustrating slow. There is no story at all!

ACNH is designed to be a relaxing life sim that has you return for short bursts of play rather than keeping you for hours at a time.

ACNH has the most customization of any Animal Crossing title, allowing a wide variety of furniture and decorations to be customized to your liking.

It is obnoxious that there is only one island per console, and that player 2 really doesn't have much to do until the main player progresses, but a lot of these issues were disclosed well before launch.

Flexosuarous,08-04-2020,"Preface: I've been playing animal crossing since the gamecube game and AC is one of my favorite gaming series of all time... that being said, this game is a bit of a disappointment.

Things I like:
-Customizing island via terraforming
-crafting items as a means of gaining furniture
-the island tours
-the graphics
-the music
- ability to place items outside
- the fencing system
-the general gameplay
- camera controls inside home
-Happy Home Designer inspired customization features inside of home

Things I don't like:
-Very lacking list of obtainable furniture
-No nintendo items
- many missing furniture sets from previous games
- The available furniture is uninspired and bland
-only two stores available, no brewsters, no kicks, no garden store
- No ressetti
-No art, Redd, or art wing of museum
-Nooks store only upgrades once
-Can't buy crafted furniture from catalog
- crafting tools is nothing more than an annoyance
- Golden tools break so there's no point in unlocking them
- Isabelle telling me absolutely nothing at the beginning of every day
- the fish and insects are no longer animated when viewing the fish/insect dex
- not fish/ bug sizes
- I've already said this in a way... BUT HAVING TO CRAFT TOOLS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES IS MADDENING

This game took 2 Steps forward with the increased customization of the island outside of one's home, placing furniture outside is great and really changes the game - but this game took 50 steps back with all of the cut material. All in all, its a decent enough game and I have enjoyed my time with it... but I'm starting to realize how empty it is. It really just makes me want to go back and play animal crossing new leaf. If i'm only going to have two stores anyways, I'd rather play wild world.
Being able to customize the island is cool and all, but it really doesn't make up for losing so much of what has made this franchise great. I hope that more of the cut content is added in the future. If we never get more shops, and nintendo items aren't added, I can't see myself playing this game for very long. I'll likely go back to new leaf or wild world. In those games I absolutely loved getting all the furniture I could in order to make my house as unique and homely as possible... in new horizons I have three rooms, two of which are completely empty because the furniture I have obtained is so boring...

My gf and I our currently playing on our own switch and have had no issues with connecting to one another and going doing our own thing or helping each other gather resources. It is a solo based playthrough/gameplay but with the added touch of a very easily setup multiplayer system, we have enjoyed it a lot with each others company.

bearsss,25-03-2020,"The game is great. I was an avid player of New Leaf, and this game is an improvement in most ways.

The graphics are amazing. I actually love taking pictures in my little town because of how pretty the water is and how nicely my character is rendered. Catching critters and chopping trees feels the same as New Leaf, which is to say, good. I really appreciate the ability to choose where the other villagers live and being able to place furniture outside. Overall it's a very strong addition to the series.

That being said, I hate that the tools can break now. It's pretty annoying when you're in the middle of a long spree of fishing or catching bugs and your tool breaks in the middle of it. I hate tool durability in general, but in a game that's supposed to just be about chilling out and having fun, this feels more like a chore. The crafting system as a whole is sort of meh to me, and I'm sure I won't like it more as my playthrough goes on.

Overall I'm giving this game a ten purely because Animal Crossing is always going to be one of my favorite comfort games, and New Horizons is an amazing update to the franchise.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

AimlessImp05,25-03-2020,"This new AC game is far beyond anything I or anyone could have hoped for. It is still AC and for those who played New Leaf you will find many similar aspects suck as the first person being the community rep like being the mayor in new leaf.

For those who read the negative views about one island per switch seem forget that you only got one town per save, 3ds, or gamecart like the previous games. If you had a digital download of new leaf you only got one town per 3ds. You get one island per switch because that's where the save data is saved to. Like a ps4 or xbox you don't save data to the disk you save to the system.
The local play could be reworked to be better but if you are done being a helper you can change leaders allowing the new leader to do everything they couldn't before. And with anything new in a series it will still need more work before it is perfected.
The only complaint i really have would be tool durability but a tool breaking is a minor inconvenience as being stung by wasps when you shake a tree and there is plenty stuff around to make new tools its not even a problem.

I honestly find my self just opening the game and listening to it so i can sleep. There is far more goals and things you can do now. And one of the best features we have always needed is the bug and fish critterpedia tells you if something has been donated so you don't need to scour your museum to see what your missing from what you caught.

SSWAGNER,25-03-2020,"I decided to tune in and let everyone reading know that Animal crossing New Horizons is a wonderful game in the Animal crossing series. The sales and positive reviews speak for itself, but there is a lot that could be improved. I would of liked to see more streamlined menus, sometimes when selling and navigating menus it can be a bit slow, an option to speed things up would of been nice, and with the multiplayer, I think the way we invite other players to our town could of been more streamlined and have less loading screens.

One big complaint people have is with the way Nintendo decided to handle multiple users playing. You can only have 1 island, and the first person to launch the game is basically the one in charge, the 2nd player has a slightly limited experience, for instance, you have to wait for the 1st player to trigger certain events such as building Tom nooks store, or deciding on where to place a bridge, and until they do that, your island will be kind of locked in a state where you don't have access to those things until player 1 unlocks them. On one hand it is a bad decision, given how there are better ways this could of been managed, but on the other hand this is Nintendo, and their vision, and this is how all animal crossing games have been more or less. However I think they should of went the extra step with multiple residents living together and I hope that they can improve things even more in the coming patches or next release.

While this game is amazing and has things that can be improved, I think a lot of the review bombing is from people that have a serious case of ""You didn't make the game I wanted you to make and now i'm upset"". Life goes on people, you don't like something, speak up, but review bombing a game in this manner is just silly.

pers0n,25-03-2020,A beautiful game. This game is full of relaxing music and actions. It hits home where other games in the series shine. It add new and interesting game play that makes your island yours. Now you will e seeing reviews annoyed Bout the how you can only have 1 island per console.

SenpaiJake,25-03-2020,"Animal Crossing has been a series beloved by many, and for good reason. It is a feel-good, calm and open-ended game that allows the user to live a second day-to-day life among the animals of the world. Animal Crossing: New Horizons stays true to that formula - in some cases - while also breathing a much needed plume of fresh air into the series.

New Horizons drops the player into a deserted island setting with two other random villagers. You are here by order of Tom Nook and his apprentices Timmy & Tommy, who have set a vacation package for you. You start off the game in a cycle of material grinding and crafting, almost as if you just started a new Minecraft world. The newest functionality in the series to date here is the crafting and use of raw materials. You will build tools (a lot), harvest raw materials from rocks and trees, and continue crafting each day to make new furniture, fulfill any requests Tom Nook lays out for you, and to even build some homes.

While there are no true end-goals or end game, Animal Crossing has never been about that. The game does give a player a general direction, in which you and Nook will build the island into a bustling little community, where you have complete control on housing location, bridges, inclines, and even the terrain! The creativity mixed with the endless amount of items there seems to be leaves for many to dump hours daily into a series you would typically only play for an hour or so every so often. This in addition to the Nook Miles, a set of finite and smaller infinite goals, allows for an addictive and repetitive game play experience. House decorating has received a major overhaul with the new drag and drop editor (a godsend!). The developer definitely focused a lot on small details too, with the gorgeous graphics depicting realistic rain, wind rustling the trees and weeds, detailed bugs and fish, and even the ability to eat fruit for a reason!

While New Horizons expands in many ways, there are some choices that have left the game feeling a little bit lonely, and others confused. Things such as Gyroids and the Cafe, or other staples of the series are completely missing. The Happy Home Academy no longer has a cool online showcase of player homes, and has gone back to simply sending you random gifts each week. A lot of the Nintendo-themed game items seemed to have disappeared, and the ones available have become extremely harder to obtain and there are few of them. One of the saddest changes to me so far seems to be with your villagers. There are so many to possibly have move in, but unlike older games where villager interaction was a major part of what you do, it feels very stripped down in New Horizons. Villagers, more often than not, repeat the same dialogues each day, and usually don't have much to say in general. It's rare to get one caught on a tangent, or ask you random questions, or request your help finding an item. In New Leaf you could even play games like Hide and Seek with them, but in New Horizons it seems they'd rather stay home or stretch in the town plaza and say a couple blips to you and that's it.

Lastly, multiplayer and the handling of saves naturally come into the discussion. A lot of people have shared concern over the fact one system has one island, and while it might be shocking to new players, this isn't the only Animal Crossing to function this way. One system usually holds one world for multiple players to play on. While they have locked progression to the first user; a bad call in many ways, the overall state of it is typical here but I can see why it would obstruct the fun for many families or couples who only have one switch. General multiplayer, especially online and local wireless, is basic and for that its fun. You can set best friends, and you can all visit each other's islands to talk to locals, hang out, and acquire materials. No qualms there.

Lastly, we have to look at the save backups. There currently exist no way to do so, but they have stated they're working on a system to cater to those that need it.

New Horizons is an amazingly fun and addictive title with beautiful graphics, cheery and calming music, and endless creative possibilities. While it's a great AC game, many series fans will be bummed about the loss of many series mainstays and might find it lacking for that matter, but it has become widely accessible for that reason, and I can safely say it is a wonderful game and I can't recommend it enough for its gameplay and aesthetic alone.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

4Plants,25-03-2020,Finally an animal Crossing where we can put our leave down outside of our house and it can actually be the object. Even though animal crossing in the past was played for years in our house--including my elderly mother who played happily played 'A New Leaf' from the day it came out until now; Our hopes finally came true with New Horizons.

This game retains the relaxed and addictive atmosphere the series is known for while also offering many quality of life improvements, such as choosing where other villagers live and the ability to place furniture outside.

Many people are having issue that multiple users on the same switch can only play on the same island, however this has been a staple of the series since the beginning. Don't believe the review bombers, this game is worth your money. Being able to play on the same island can be a fun experience. You and your other islanders can work together to make a little piece of paradise. It is true that only the first character made can go though the starting tutorial, but this is honestly a great choice as it can be slow and put many people new to the series off.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

The one downside IMO is the fact only one player, the first to start the game, is the the only one who can progress the “campaign“ game.

My complaints arise when it comes to multiple people playing. I think that the decision to have one island per console, to build the community with those you play with would be understandable... IF other players had the same influence as the main player.

It is understandable to not want certain people to be able to modify the island, but it isn't an option to choose, extra players past the first are automatically restricted in what they can do. It seems like it should be simple to give the main player the choice of allowing others the same management privileges as they have.

Purple_Avenger,26-03-2020,"Was looking forward to playing this but when i joined i was the second on the island and so missed out on the full intro and welcome onto the island as well as access to tools and other features. which makes the game unplayable and a completley soured experiance for anyone sharing a console.

From a single player perspective the game is charming and the gameplay is what you can expect if you have played an animal crossing game before (peaceful and fun) Though the first week you can feel like you are waiting around for the infrastructure of the island to be built before you can let loose with your creativity. If you are a single player it is worth a buy if you like animal crossing games. As a second/Third/Fourth player I cant recomend this game to play if you were intending on sharing an island.

It feels like an odd choice to make it this way as the trailers and promotional material did not state from what i saw that the second players would miss out on so much of the features it was always mentioning what great multiplayer it would have. Just seems very un-nintendo. I can only hope that they change the way the game is saved so that each profile has their own save/island i would even maybe be a little less salty if it was cartridge locked so me and my partner could each have our own AC cartridge on the same switch but if we wanted our own islands now we would need to buy another switch making this seem like nintendo knew what they were doing hoping people would buy a second switch.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

You are cut out of most decision making. Now, go and live ""your"" unless you wanna find a new mum and be the first born.
This is what is like to be second player in this game. The save file restriction for each island per console is just too much.
I don't think this game need any multiplayer as you can't even share the gaming experience with the people you live the closest.

Charlii,27-03-2020,"I have loved every minute of Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The graphics of the game are beautiful, and the attention to detail is amazing. The possibilities for decorating your island are literally endless, and the pro design feature helps your character feel like... you. Decorating your home and your island makes it really feel like you’re building a community from the ground up, and that’s an amazing feeling to have when you’re playing a game like this. New Horizons’ gameplay is therapeutic, and you can sink hours into the game without even realizing it. The islanders are all unique, and having all of these different personalities is part of what makes this game so immersive. Even the crafting feature, which I wasn’t so excited for before release, is such a great feature to the game. The museum looks beautiful, especially the fish exhibit. The Nook Miles system is also a great addition to the franchise as an exciting new way to get new islanders to come to your island. Overall, the single-player experience is a must-play for anyone who owns a switch. Now, on to the multiplayer. I have to say, some people who have been reviewing this game aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. You can’t be mad when you realize that there’s only one island per switch after it was advertised to you. The online multiplayer was amazing from my experience, as you can get your friends to come see your island, and you can go see theirs. This adds to the feeling of community you get from spending countless hours on this game. I’d easily give this game a 10/10.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
pinkquake,27-03-2020,"I am extremely angry on how nintendo decided to deal with multiplayer. Honestly, I would probably rate this at least 4 stars... IF I COULD ACTUALLY PLAY. My sister bought the family's nintendo switch, so she always gets first pick on what to play and who gets to play. She also bought our copy of New horizons. I was very excited to play, as I had New Leaf but got it when i was young and wasn't really trying to progress. When she got back, she had played for about the rest of the day. I asked if I could play, and she told me that you can only have 1 ISLAND PER SWITCH. That is so dumb to me and I don't see any other point of Nintendo doing that other then to lure you into buying a new switch console. I still played with her though, and the leader thing is also so dumb. If you're not gonna let everyone have their own experience, at least let us all talk to people and actually be able to go around. I am definitely not buying a $300 console just to play animal crossing, so i really hope they change this. It's obvious that they are doug it for greed, and I would HAPPILY buy another $60 game to have my own island. But that wound work either. So good job Nintendo, I CANT be the only one who is enraged by this. I'm not going to buy into your greed and get another console. Hopefully this helps anyone looking to buy the game that was advertised as a ""family"" game, and i hope you rethink and try not to give greedy nintendo money for this terrible idea :)",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

ArmstrongH,27-03-2020,"Wow, what an overrated POS game. I have played ALL the Animal Crossing games. People are treating this AC like it's something brand new and ""fresh"" when it's again, literally the same game they've been making since the N64 version and then the ported Gamecube version.
In fact, this game is WORSE than the previous iterations - there's no Gyroids, for example! - and you can't have a second player come on to your island and be treated the same exact way as you would. What were they thinking?

I just don't understand why everyone's treating this game like it's something amazing - where were you people when AC came out on Gamecube? Oh not even born yet? How about DS? How about 3DS? Wii? For all the cool things this game has (mostly small improvements to UI and custom designs), it's a HUGE step backward. I'm done with the AC franchise for good.

It's honestly pathetic how this review bombing is turning out. If you take a look at hundreds of 0 reviews you'll find their logic extremely flawed. And most of all, I noticed a common pattern between these reviewers. It always starts out with ""My wife/kid/friend wanted to play the game too, but you can only have one island per switch! I thought this game was good until I realized this! KEYWORD: GOOD. Look, I'm sure there's plenty of legitimate reasons why someone would want to rate this game a 0/10 but this is just petty. Most of these people were enjoying the game OR think the game is good, and yet they give the game a whopping ZERO because their wife can't play! Nintendo CLEARLY stated the game would only have one island per switch, and these people are acting so surprised that their wives/friends/kids can't have a different island. One feature (and not a big one at that, multiplayer isn't essential to the game) shouldn't affect the entire score of the game. These people would at least give it a 2 or a 3 if they were taking this seriously. I'm not trying to act like a fanboy here but this is just getting out of hand. If you don't believe me just look at all of these reviews. This is why nobody respects the gaming community. I'm giving this game a 10/10 because I'm trying to combat all of these unfair reviews.

We all realized we can't do anything until my Mom signs in to do whatever she needs to do. This just includes talking to Tom Nook to progress the game. Something that I CAN'T DO. And, the local multiplayer is wildly disappointing as well, It's even more limiting than no co-op lol. If they just added splitscreen that'd do wonders for the co-op experience. This is ridiculous Nintendo, I was happy with the game until it was all soiled just by some basic mechanics in it. This game would be saved if they just gave it a quick patch where you can give representative permissions, or change the island representative.

KKittiy,31-03-2020,"Frankly I’m disappointed in Nintendo. I am new to animal crossing I have no experience with previous games. However all that being said it’s a good game. I has good graphics but it’s lacking on a few points. First one island per switch is insane. I have two sisters, my family can not afford 3 switches so we cannot all play a 60$ game. Next, the game functions in real time in some ways that’s awesome things rely on time of day. But also I am a student who cannot log on all day so I miss certain fish and bugs. With it running in real time it takes real days for jobs to be completed. For example you place the lot for a house after 5am the following morning it will be built. The only real story to the game is improving your house and island. All other aspects are a gathering aspect, as in find resources. When improving your house you don’t get to pick new roof or bigger room it’s a set order each becoming more and more expensive. I understand teaching the player responsibility but playing the game the proper way without exploits (like tarantulas) makes a 2.5 million $/bells loan unrealistic. With loans and things you pick what they are for. I’m also loosing interest because after playing for a week I’m still stuck with an island I cannot customize. I have great plans for what I want but no way to do them. I thought I was buying a game I could sit and play for hours but I don’t see how that is possible when I can’t do anything. I fish and catch bugs with hopes of paying my crazy house loans and for what? Weeks upon weeks before I can do what I desire.

I am disappointed with how the game makers decided to do this when the switch handles profiles so well compared to previous Nintendo products.

I'm honestly baffled at this decision by the developers.

4. The game doesn't give you an option to have fasted dialog. 5. You need to go through the dumbest receptive dialog when accessing stores or the nook system.

When placing down trees or buildings you get no indication whether or not it's going to fit. And if it does and its not aligned as you want it you have to re do the dialog to place again. Why is there no outline indication. I really enjoyed the start but as the game progresses and there's more stuff to do. 2 hour useless npc talking and A button smashing is getting annoying. Going to fly in the airport? Yeah wait 1122 years for the stupid dodo to shutup.

Wanna craft multiple items? You wish there was a craft X amount. No you need to re do the craft dialog Not seamless. And a game like this needs to be or all you get is frustration. Seriously in a game based around design why can't you get align grids when placing trees or plans. Instead of wasting 50k to relocate to fit.

For a game that prides itself on self-discovery and the freedom to do what you want, there is very little choice. The switch was conceived with groups and families in mind. Why can’t every family member play their own way? Most people don’t have the money to just buy another switch and are now stuck having spent 80$ on a game that not everyone can enjoy the same way.

I thought nintendo was better than this, I would expect such behavior out of EA but nintendo is worse than EA because they are costing us $300 dollars minimum each for people who do not own a switch! ($300 is the price of a switch mini and a copy of new horizons.) The only way nintendo can make this up to their customers is to remove the one island per console rule and put out a formal apology.

fozie,03-04-2020,"I've played every Animal Crossing game as they were released, and was ecstatic for New Horizons. The game is beautiful, and you can tell that a lot of work went into the visuals and scenery. Aside from that, I feel like it's lacking even compared to its older predecessors. I was hoping for a greater variety of dialogue with villagers, but interactions are very limited and repetitive. The villagers are the staple of Animal Crossing. I was so excited to finally have a game that would have rich, personable interaction, more villager games, etc. Villagers used to host flea markets and visit your house for fun or vice versa. They used to have interactive aerobics and sports fairs. Now they just wander around and do their own thing, but your character doesn't even have the ability to sit down or join them. I can already predict the 3-5 dialogue options I'll hear each day from every villager. It's disappointing. The lack of amenities is also frustrating. When previous games like City Folk and New Leaf had coffee shops, theaters, and other stores, we were expecting more - not expecting everything to be taken away. Now that I've paved and decorated my town, there really isn't anything to do. I can see that they added the Nook Miles system as a way to keep you busy but most of us aren't interested in doing menial tasks for numbers, we wanted more room for interaction with our villagers and island. Once everyone has played for a month or so, they'll be finding that there really isn't anything to do in this game. Unfortunately I'm probably going to end up putting this game down and picking up Wild World or New Leaf unless some updates roll out to change things.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

Gameplay is repetitive and gets old real quick. It’s just a very boring game. I’ve played for a week and it’s time for me to sell this game on for sure.

I’m sure the score would be even less if I had to play this in a house with two players.

However, we can't afford another Switch and with COVID-19 it'll be awhile before we can responsibly afford it. I don't understand Nintendo's decision to have one island per Switch and not per game or profile. It is seen as a family entertainment system and AC cannot entertain a family at the moment. One person per Switch can truly experience the game and that is not okay. Also, there is no reason not to offer cloud back ups. The Switch is a home and portable console. Being portable adds risks.

poopyy,05-04-2020,"My issue with the game is that the controls are overly sensitive in that if you’re one pixel off the fish won’t see the line and if you are digging a hole or wanting to plant something the odds of it being where you want is about 40%. It’s also too easy to undo something that you wanted because the controls are so sensitive/picky. If you had an update with the options of simpler controls and interactions similar to Pocket Camp, the game would be much more relaxing and enjoyable. The other issue is the mystery island AI, there should be a quiz or something at the beginning of the game that is focused on which villager type or style you like because I (and probably many others) have wasted over 20 Nook Miles Tickets and over 40,000 Nook Miles trying to find the villager I want or at least a decent villager to invite. Or the least you could do is make Nook Miles tickets cheaper, or have them be purchasable with bells, because at a certain point it’s hard to get enough Nook Miles. Or there at least has to be a way to invite a villager other than buying an amiibo card.

We have 1 Switch for our household ( yea you already know where this is going ), and I have to say I’m more than bummed that the game treats every other profile other than the first to boot up the game as an obvious player 2. Fact is, this game doesn’t work as it is on a multi user Switch.

I get the reason behind this both from a consumer and business point of view however, that doesn’t excuse what a blatant attempt this is to push more Switch consoles out. And frankly this makes no sense, in fact it goes against their online subscription business model where you can either buy for an individual or family (8). Clearly one console is designed to be used by many users so why aren’t the save features of this first party title. This review comes from 2 people with 1 switch.

Tetsujinsei,09-04-2020,"For a game that's about making friends and togetherness, the game isolates everyone besides the primary player. No one can do anything important besides the primary player such as building important bridges or new houses, why? It would be fine if there were more things to do but there isn't. Exploring seemingly random islands and trying to get the biggest payout for every trip can only be done so many times before I get burnt out. Decorating can only get me so far and from what I've heard there are apparently not many furniture options to decorate with. I want to build a town and see new faces besides the two villagers my wife and I first started out with but I can't do anything, there's no point in being a secondary player in this Animal Crossing. If the secondary player chops trees or mines rocks it renders those resources empty for other players for a while, taking away their resources. Besides that, another huge issue I have with the game is optimization issues. Why do I have to eat one orange at a time? Why not give an option to eat a certain number of food items at one time without having to click over and over again and give it a slightly longer animation? The same thing happens with releasing fish; you need to go into your pockets, click on the fish, click release. This for some reason takes you out of the menu to play the same tired animation. Chances are you have more than one thing you want to drop to empty out your limited inventory so you end up going into your inventory several times and it takes way longer than it should. This game does everything in its power to waste your time like clicking through dozens of text boxes to donate anything for instance.

Far1and,10-04-2020,"Extremely disappointed by the multi-player experience.
As a young adult, I played the Gamecube Animal Crossing with my family. We all had a great time. It's been so long that I can't remember all the game mechanics, but it seemed to me that everyone contributed and had a great time playing the game. My dad, the 3rd person to start playing, earned the gold statue.
Fast forward to 2020 - now I'm a dad and I was on the fence about buying a Switch since I've collected quite a few consoles over the years. I was interested in some of the Nintendo exclusive titles, but when I saw there was going to be an Animal Crossing game on the Switch, I was sold. Bought the Switch and pre-ordered AC:NH. Even purchased a Nintendo online subscription to play with remote friends.
I kept thinking of how much fun I had playing the Gamecube version, and imagined doing the same with my young daughters and wife. I really talked it up with them, the fond memories of building a home, seeing K.K. play at the train station.. how we all got statues towards the end of the game.. how much fun it was to play - playing together.
Game arrived, and since my older daughter had been good, let her fire it up and make her villager first (a mistake).
Things seemed fine, but then.. after a few days I couldn't figure out how to make a shovel. Or an axe.. seemed odd. I had paid off my tent loan, had Nook miles+.. bought DIY recipes for a shovel.. axe.. but those required a flimsy axe or flimsy shovel to craft. I was quite confused. After Googling.. I was in complete disbelief over what Nintendo had sold me.
I fully expected us to share 1 island. That's how it was on the Gamecube (although you could probably make multiple saves on multiple cards). I think I would have been disappointed had it NOT been 1 island. That's sort of the point, playing together, a community.. common good and all that. Seeing your co-players houses, what they've planted, what's new at the museum etc.
AC:NH is a huge disappointment to me. It's been stated a million times, but only the 1st player - the resident representative - gets a real game. Everyone else is extremely limited in what they can do.

Althrayn,15-04-2020,"Hate to be part of review bombing but I think it's the only way to have attention brought to this.

It's one thing to limit everyone to one island...the island is large enough that if people don't want to live near each other they can stay apart. But the current system in which the island's progress is completely tied to the progress of whoever the first player on the console is is absolutely ridiculous. There's no need for it in my eyes, I can't see any reason why it should have to be this way; I don't want to be cynical of nintendo, but it honestly feels like a move to sell more systems--simply because I can't fathom any other reason that would be necessary.

Personally speaking as a player 2 on the island, it feels like I have no point in playing. I don't get assignments from Tom Nook, which means I don't get any recipes like my P1 does; I also don't get to invite citizens to the island, or plan infrastructure, or make any decisions. Basically I'm playing home decorator 2020, because I can't contribute anything to the island aside from paying money towards bridges/stairs and throwing some furniture outside.

Hopefully the devs catch wind of the review bombing and seek to patch this out sooner rather than later. Again, being on one island is fine, but having no options to contribute as player 2 is ridiculous. Its as simple as giving P2+ the options to change infrastructure and invite settlers; and if you're worried about doubling-up missions, just have Tom Nook announce that someone else is working on an assignment for him already, and then have him lay out what the assignment is and give the recipes needed for the other players to help.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Pepper12,15-04-2020,"I was so excited for this game and now I hate it, I didn't know one design decision could make me so upset with Nintendo and the animal crossing franchise. The switch was advertised as a family console with great multiplayer options, much the same the new animal crossing was also marketed with great family experience. However, seems to me that the only people who are enjoying this game are the ones who own one switch per person. I could almost get on board with sharing an island but other players outside the primary get a **** version of what should be a good game, with little to no participation in the story line and island creation. This is a ruthless and greedy scheme by Nintendo to force people to buy multiple devices (family marketed devices not solo marketed devices), makes me disgusted and I no longer want to support Nintendo.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Doooodal,16-04-2020,"Amazing game. Haven’t stopped playing it since I bought it. A lot people complaining about the island representative not being shared is kind of understandable, but it’s definitely not worth rating the game 1 or 0 stars. Sure “your” user doesn’t have 100% control on the island at the moment but there are ways around this. You can just ask firstly, haha, or you can log in as their user and do the things necessary. Idk I’m sure there are other ways around this. My gf just grabs an extra controller and calls my in game char in, swaps leader and plays as my char if she really wants do something. Think outside of the box people!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
WarMonkey87,16-04-2020,"This game is awful. For So. Many. Reasons. Multiplayer is a nightmare - no matter if you're playing locally or online. Online - oh god - that's a mess. Over and over again, people can leave your island by disconnecting or just quitting - which results in you losing anything that you've done or received. That 100k or cool recipe you just got? POOF! It's gone. Congrats. And the one island-per-switch choice is moronic. If you are a parent thinking you can get this and enjoy playing with your kids but having your own island - you're SOL.

But if you want, I can still come visit your islan- hold on a second. The game needs to pause every time someone leaves or enters your island. So if you just got some killer turnip prices or a meteor shower and want to make some money from people visiting...um, good luck with that. It's fantastic gameplay, lemme tell you.

However, what makes this game so bad goes far, far beyond that. You get a dialog popup for. EVERY. SINGLE. THING. THAT. YOU. DO. Caught that same fish for the 100th time? Let me give you a dialog box! Want to visit another island? Here's 10 dialog boxes for you! Want to craft an item? Here's 5 dialog boxes for each item you want to craft! Did you close that dialog box? Here's another one for closing it. So much time is spent on stupid aspects of the game that are simply - dumb - design decisions.

By the way, you'll be crafting each item individually as there's no bulk crafting. Fishing is annoying as the timing of when fish change directions is almost exactly the same as the time it takes for each cast. NMT islands get boring incredibly fast. This game repeatedly feels like a free-to-play game because at multiple points, you cannot progress until a day passes.

I've played life sim games like this. At this point, I'm wholly recommending you play Stardew over this game. It's cheaper too, and the dev will straight up respond to your suggestions or bug reports on Twitter. The sad thing is ALL of these issues are just dumb design choices that could be fixed easily with a patch. The QA team should be fired for how bad this game feels at times.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
awi,16-04-2020,"I do love this game, very much, but there are a LOT of clunky things that I’m disappointed to see. Considering almost all of the reviews on here are about the inability to create multiple islands on one console, I won’t cover that (and it wasn’t an issue for me, as I’m the only person who uses my Switch). However, I have a lot of other disappointments. I won’t go over the things I love because the critics covered it all—everything they said is definitely true. This is by far the best Animal Crossing yet, despite the huge flaws. I’m very disappointed to see that there’s no way to access your storage outside of your home. The storage is much better than before, don’t get me wrong—you can store much more, and the game auto-sorts your stuff for you. Character customization and clothing customization is far better than ever. But when you add crafting, several things need to be changed. Even in previous games, you could access your storage through either the post office or train station. Considering you can place items which used to link to your storage (dressers, chests, etc) out in your island now, why can’t you use those to access storage? I know this wouldn’t be “realistic,” but Animal Crossing isn’t exactly about realism. The multiplayer is clunky as hell, too. Connection has been pretty bad every time I play, and the longass animation whenever people join or leave is AWFUL. If you want to play with more than one friend at once, you’re out of luck. Not to mention that if someone tries to leave, and others don’t “close their windows” (aka, menus or conversations), a ten second timer will tick down. If it hits 0, the person trying to leave will go home with an error code and lose EVERYTHING they did while on the island, as well as everyone else losing what they got while interacting with the player. This is absolutely horrendous and makes no sense to me. Players can essentially sabotage others if they want to using this. Also, the restrictions on what you can do while others are over is annoying. Why can’t I rearrange furniture when someone’s over? Why can’t I order catalog items? It’s infuriating, particularly the inability to move things around your island or home. The crafting system and shops also sorely need updates. Why can’t I craft more than one thing at once? Why do some of my DIY recipes require that I know other DIY recipes? Why can’t I use a slider to buy however many flower seeds I want, like when buying turnips from Daisy Mae? Why can’t I buy more than one shirt or pants at the Able Sisters? It never feels good to sit there and watch the crafting animation 30 times in a row because you’re just trying to make fish bait to catch a rare fish. This should be much, much easier to do. There are some little improvements I love—the drop-off box for selling items is great, and I like the way flowers are handled, as well as the terraforming. But why are custom paths still able to be destroyed with the B button (the same button for picking up items, mind you), and why can other people destroy them? If you’re going to add paths to the game, and the ability to literally pave custom paths using this path tool, why don’t they act like paths? The game is certainly not worth a 0/10, it’s fantastic, but all of these small issues are a huge disappointment.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Rosscoe,22-04-2020,"Made this account specifically to warn people about the nefarious business tactics that are underpinning the cute aesthetics.

If you plan on playing this game with other people in your household on a single switch then think again as that really isn’t possible. Only 1 game/island per switch, not per profile. Additional profiles can only visit the 1st players game and cannot start their own. This is a conscious design decision by Nintendo to try and force households to purchase a console for every member of household. So it’s not £50 for the game. It’s actually the amount of people in your household x (£50 + £200). A rip off basically.

Sort it out Nintendo, you know you’ve done this deliberately and could easily fix it",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
Beardo7,22-04-2020,"Update - scored this a 6 after a few weeks but now a few months in and it’s gotten very dull. If you enjoy a game with no direction or goal at all where you just repeat the same boring menial tasks over and over (with horrendous UI) for no reason get this - if you want a similar game but with interesting stories and things to aim for get the far far superior Stardew Vally. (Which is also £40 cheaper! And 100 times more fun) I’ll break down AC simply Boot up

See nothing is happening Collect the same Fruit/fossils you have collected for the past 40 days Sell them Check turnip prices

Hear the same dialogue from your villagers you’ve heard (well read) for the 50th time.

All this takes about 5-10 mins

Turn off for another day and wonder why you spent £50 on a mobile game for a £300 console.

And repeat. . 1st of all no way this game is a 10 but neither is it a 0!

The game is relaxing and a good way to chill and out get your creative mind going to see what ideas you can come up with for your island and it can be good fun! And building your museum collection up with insects and fish is nicely done and good to see your efforts displayed. The fossils part is done well and actually displays them in a chronological and evolutional order which is fun to discover and I’m sure kids will love it. However this lasts about a week and then after that it starts to wear a bit thin.

I have no problem with the real time aspect of the game per-say (I also dolt mind the accelerated clock in Stardew Vally both have their merits) however I do feel like it was done to extend the life of the game. And the repetitive nature of the game does become a bit boring you will find yourself just doing the same menial tasks over and over for little or no reward. At times it does feel like a mobile game you have paid £50 for to play on a £300 console. Also it’s 2020 Nintendo why is it not a fully 3D game? Not being able to rotate the camera 360 degrees? I mean come on.

Not being able to craft more than 1 thing at a time is also annoying I have 8 clams and I want to make 8 fish bait, I can’t just select make 8 and it does it, no you have to go through the same process and animation 8 times! The islands you visit via nook miles will soon become repetitive as seems to be limited to about 10(?) different layouts I have visited the same island 3 times in 2 days. 6000 miles well spent.

The dialog with your island buddies soon becomes irritating as they just repeat the same lines over and over and don’t really offer anything. Multiplayer is a mess why can’t I open my gate and my friends just pop over? No I have to sit through the same loading screen and animation for every person that visits and same when they leave plus when they are arrive there is nothing to do? No mini games or anything to do together which is a shame. I have also knocked a point off for the 1 island per console stroke that Nintendo have pulled just to try and sell more units - luckily me and my wife are happy to share a character so in our house it’s not an issue but I can see how it could cause problems. The tools breaking without any warning is also frustrating! Why no status bar? We had this in Minecraft a game that was made in what 2007? And gold tools shouldn’t break! I’ve worked hard for them and the they just break? It should be a reward for all your hard work. I don’t want to seem like I’m just moaning about the game as I have had fun playing it and i think of your prepared to look past the annoyances there is a good game in there! And it’s a break from the normal FPS/Action/FIFA style games. I just wish a bit more thought was put into the UI and Quality Of Life of the player. I also have a sneaking suspicion that Micro Transactions are on the way as it’s a game primed for it but I hope I’m wrong!

Would have got a 7/10 from me if it wasn’t for the 1 island per switch idea. I think 6/10 is a fair score.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
Electrohead,29-04-2020,"The game has a fantastic first two weeks that does a great job at constantly giving you new tasks that introduce new gameplay mechanics to the player. Once you complete the 'story', you're pretty much able to customize anything you want, resulting in the ability to make some pretty incredibly designed islands and homes.

The presentation is fantastic. The game's graphics are very stylized and the NPCs are all very expressive, making the game feel like a real living world. The music is all very cute as well, especially the tracks by K.K. Slider.

You will eventually reach a point where the game becomes a lot less fun to play for extended periods of time; which is the norm for Animal Crossing. Thankfully though, Nintendo seems to be planning on supporting the game after launch and have already re-introduced past features like the Art Museum and Redd.

crevassier,27-04-2020,"The PERFECT game during a stupid pandemic.

Personally I am OK with just having the one island, however, the management side of things should have been extended to all players and not just the first one.

This does not ruin the game completely and it's still a great successor to the series. Hopefully the devs can constructively move forward with an update that allows people to start easier. I wish I had known this limitation on launch day, but we stayed away from too much info so we didn't spoil the initial fun and no one wants to reset your stuff after a few days of work already got put in.

The amount of arguments between younger family members that have ensued as a result of this weird player 1 power dynamic is almost not worth having the game.

I am also worried about the inability to backup a copy of my island. What if something happens to my switch? too bad for me? And if the option does become available but only with a Nintendo online account, I will have to pay to keep my island backed up, even though I have already paid for the game?

Not to mention the fact that even with owning TWO separate copies of New Horizons, neither will create a new island. This is completely different from playing Wild World as a child and I am so disappointed in the obvious greed that fuelled this decision.

The problem (and it is a huge problem) is that you can only have 1 island per switch and the person who created the island is effectively the only one who can really make any decisions about the island. In my house, we have 2 switches, but there are four of us who would like to play animal crossing. That leaves 2 people very upset and for me, drops this game all the way down to one star for all the problems it creates in my house. It is frankly ridiculous that I would need to buy four switches so each member of my family could enjoy the game. Moms beware.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Isaac_,06-05-2020,"While I would love to give this game the glowing review it deserves, I cannot truthfully do so. The simple fact that no two players can have their own island on the same Switch is outrageous. This feature makes the game not worth purchasing if you intended to share it with someone else. This should be changed, but as long as it stays the same this game is not worth it for more than one person.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Flappa,06-05-2020,"Only good if you're the first player- the player who sets the game up. If you're the second player, you can't do anything except upgrade your house and sell stuff. If you don't share a switch with anyone, it would be great! If you have multiple players, there's no way around it. You'd have to delete your island.

Kotorichan,10-05-2020,"The UI is annoyingly inconvenient and conversations with villager are repeating and empty. The fact that tools frequently break without any notification is also irritating.

Many furniture is reduced from previous New Leaf. Furthermore, despite the ""remake"" option in DIY, most of the furniture with colour variation is not remake-able. There are about 6 colour types for all furniture, but a single player can collect only one type of them on their own. To get the colour that you don't have, you have to do multiplayer which again is so inconvenient mainly because of 1-minute freezing time inserted each time when a player joins to an island.

Furthermore, although this game is advertised to enjoy the multiplayer, there aren't many things to do online except trading furniture or selling turnip (online mini-games existed in New Leaf is now gone). Not to mention that other systems that were available in previous games, such as town ordinance and haniwa, are now deleted.

But the graphic is ok considering it is animal crossing.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
gorgonzolon,09-05-2020,"I was so disappointed with this game. It was so exciting with all the new features and the amount of control you have over the island, as well as the option for local multiplayer. I'm the eldest of 3 siblings and we share a switch, but they can't play the way I play at all. Like everyone is saying, this is the dumbest idea Nintendo could have possibly come up with. I'm sure they want to sell more switches but not everyone can afford to spend 400 dollars just to play the new animal crossing game. Shame on you, Nintendo.

That's not even all of it, the gameplay itself is atrocious. Put aside the 1 island per switch issue and you're left with a game that uses up half of your playtime in menus you can't speed up. At least in New Leaf and such you had the option to skip through dialogue with (B) and not have to sit there button mashing for a good 30 seconds just to go to Tortimer's island, for example. The crafting would be SO fun if it wasn't so tedious.

I was also excited about the path system! That was something we desperately needed but the way it works is really infuriating when you just want your island to look neat. Having grassy gaps and not being able to fill in spaces under or around structures... it boils me alive. I know I'm nitpicking at this point, but they made Animal Crossing for the switch. It should pride itself in a little more polish and playability.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

He's the one who started the game up so he's the primary player and I'm just a visitor on his island who can't contribute or progress the game in any meaningful way. I was extremely disappointed when I logged onto my account and saw the same island instead of an entirely new save file. The game would be a lot better without this blatant cash grab of a policy and I have to say I regret buying it. Don't bother wasting $60 if you share your switch, because to experience the game in full you'd need to fork over an additional $300 or so for a new switch plus another copy of the game. So basically $360 per island. Nice. The reason I rate it so low is to draw attention to this glaring issue.

This makes it so only one player can make decisions and really do anything important on their island. I think this is wildy unfair considering that in order to fix this you would have to buy a second console which is just ridiculous. The switch is pricey enough as it is so it's only right that multiple people could play this switch exclusive game on a single console.

Nintendo has yet to outgrow their penchant for text boxes / animations in extreme excess that serve only to waste your time, and multiplayer is a plane-infested disaster, sorely lacking meaningful ways to interact with others outside of an online economy sullied by time travel and hacking. Will consider changing rating to a solid 6 if Nintendo unlocks multiple islands per switch and drastically improves user experience. (Suggestion: multi craft/print/buy.)

I started playing to see what it was all about and indeed, it's a utterly terrible decision made by Nintendo to require you to buy 1. another switch console and 2. another ACNH copy and 3. not allow you in any way to keep your save game online and 4. not allow you to transfer the part that you've progressed to another Switch console with another game copy netting €260! So the game doesn't deserve anything more than a 0. Nintendo should feel the pain and fix this. For any other game I know it's super easy to do all those things on the same console and heck, even the free-to-play Fortnite gives me the possibility to switch between Xbox and Switch freely, the same goes with my son and we don't even need the Online membership to play online. Yet here we are with ACNH and I wouldn't be bother with the €35 additional yearly membership for a family subscription, if it would allow the full experience and not limit you to the progress of the first player, which becomes frustrating extremely quickly. And not just that, you know what the only option is for the 2nd/3rd/4th player when (in this example my wife) the first player stops liking ACNH and therefore stops playing? You might've guessed it... start completely over with a completely blank island altogether, there is no way to transfer the ownership or keep your own progress in any way.

Zaltys,16-04-2020,"This series is starting to focus more and more on things that I don't enjoy.
Nook is even more of a slave driver, and the merit system makes the game feel more stressful. And this time around you need to pay for everything, including bridges and inclines. By the time I was done with those and got access to the new terraforming feature, I was completely exhausted to the point that I don't feel like playing this anymore. Having to replace broken tools every five minutes certainly doesn't help.

All of that wouldn't be so bad if the villager dialogue wasn't (against all odds) even worse than in City Folk. I've been playing for a couple of weeks, and have already heard the same lines about 'digging up fossils yesterday' nearly a hundred times. Dialog is more generic than before. For instance, the villagers say that 'you wear that a lot' about everything as opposed to the previous AC games where they'd comment about WHAT you're wearing, etc. And while you can now place furniture outdoors, these too get generic responses from the animals: 'who put a drinking fountain outside? That's so weird'.

Basically if you've ever played a game outside of the Nintendo lineup say like...

Minecraft, Terraria, Rimworld, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, Starbound, Kenshi, etc etc etc. you quickly realize that there is almost nothing to Animal Crossing and certainly nothing making it worth paying full price for.

The world is extremely tiny, it's based on real time (which is cool on paper but terrible in practice), it's got 0 challenge, and it plays like a mobile game (in fact it looks just like it's mobile version Pocket Camp). You can run the entire starting area in about a minute, there are woefully limited resources across the entire island and woefully limited events or things to do across the entire game.

It has characters that you will adore and build long-lasting attachments to. It has the nerve to make chores desirable, and it has the special sauce that we all needed during this quarantine.

This is a game that was created with the highest amount of polish possible in this industry, but most importantly, it was made with an absolutely overwhelming amount of love & care, and it shows through and through",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
not-john-locke,29-04-2020,Simply the best Animal Crossing to date. All the best features from the past Animal Crossings on Nintendo's best console in decades. Been playing it since day one and I'm still finding fun things to do. Nintendo just keeps hitting it out of the park. My girlfriend loves it too. A must buy!,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
tacsman,26-07-2020,Endless fun! I've put in over 300 hours since launch and don't see any end in sight.,9,ACNH,METACRITIC
OneMariachi,12-04-2020,"There's a lot of negative reviews complaining about the lack of ability to create your own unique island. Now whilst this is an incredibly valid issue with this game. I realise it may not apply to a large subset of players. On the other side there is a lot of very high marks from people that don't care about that.

I felt I wanted to give a more full summary and review of this game, to give those that probably sit in the middle of not being a long time fan, and having played this game for the first time, like me. I've put in roughly 50 hours into this game. With only 2 days of time travel done at the beginning to speed up the nothing you can do in the first 2-3 days of owning this game.

Effectively, the good parts. Nintendo, as always are very good at creating charming worlds. Filled with lovely character, and look really nice. The graphics are wonderful to behold. One fo the best aspects of this game in my particular view is the designing as pects. There is a lot of items and a lot of ways they can be utilised to make unique little biomes for yourself to enjoy and feel creative. I had a lot of fun organising my house.

Beyond that though. There really is not a whole lot to do. Once you've built the shop/museum and got a few rooms of your house. This game gets insanely repetitive. The game becomes, pick fruit. fish a little, dig your 4 fossills(which, you run out of unique ones super quick). Hit some rocks, and buy some of the new clothes. Slowly making money to add a new room to your house. It's rinse and repeat of that, for about an hour every day as once you've completed that routine, there is nothing else to do.

The big thing is that i was doing all of that, to get the terraforming. I spent an hour a day doing this repetitive nonsense so I could terraform and really make the island my own. when I finally got terraforming. I finally had to go, yep that's enough for me.

See here is the big major issue with this game. The repetitive stuff, lots of people can look past. they find it relaxing and stress free, a nice mindless task to focus on and remove the pressures of life from. Me, I don't really get it, I like being creative, so that's why I stuck to it. The thing is though, that Nintendo seem to be stuck in the early 90's when it comes to game mechanics. There are so many barriers in the way of you trying to enjoy this game to the best of its ability. The constant repetition of dialogue, the inability to organise your inventory properly, the inability to build more than one item at a time, or buy more than one item at a time- which is annoying in the Nook atm machine- but ten thousand times worse when at the Abel sisters house and you have to keep walking in and out of the dressing room if you want more than 1 shirt at a time. The seemingly no reason for why trees wont grow. The multiplayer is gimped hard too, Nintendo and internet simply do not work. You want a friend to come over. Cool, go to the airport and open your gates, hidden behind 10 mintues worth of dialogue. Jesus Christ Nintendo, allow me to have my gates open at all times, or at least allow my friends to request to come over through the use of the Nook phone. A quick invite and join system through the phone. But no, it's a whole infuriating process- even after they've visited the first time and become a ""best friend"". Either Nintendo are incredibly incompetent at game QOL, or they know how to fix these things and don't in order to artificially increase game time, because they know how little actual game-play there is in this game.

Terraforming, is without a doubt one of the most poorly implemented mechanics I've seen Nintendo create, and I genuinely don't know if this game was actually tested properly. Because it is a joke. There is no marker for where you are creating, and it will constantly, and randomly, without any logic choose a different square to work on, regardless of if you do the same action. On top of that, you will either fill land in, or remove land, with the exact same button- use the rest of the buttons Nintendo. One for filling one for removing land. How insanely hard is that to think of. Forcing you to work several times on the same squares because of the lack of any guidance and logic to the system. This game reeks if eitehr laziness or incompetence. I don't know which, and I don't much care. But this game is not even close to being perfect, and has a lot of work needing to be done on it to make it beyond a 6/10.

TLDR; Had some fun with creating, but there are way too many terrible UI/Game mechanics, and repetitive annoying dialogue to allow me to think it is a good game.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
LunarD3ATH,19-06-2020,"This is a fantastic game. Let's get that nailed in right out of the gate, because while I agree with the complaints about Nintendo's handling of cloud saves, individual islands and so on, I don't think that reflects so poorly on the game that it deserves to be review-bombed. Though I do believe review-bombing has its place and if it helps, then so be it, I won't object.

This is the BEST Animal Crossing game. Period. It's not only visually stunning, it has tons of improvements large and small that have made this a joy to continue to play. Usually I'm done with Animal Crossing by now. I buy a copy, I play it for a month or two, then I drop it and rarely ever come back unless really bored and only for a few minutes, even for holiday events.

But with the wide depth of customization options for your villager, your home and your island, this really is the most control we've ever had in an Animal Crossing game.

To counter the negativity, let's point out some of the pros:

First, you can customize your character right from the start, rather than getting random hair and face options. You have limited options at the start, but you can unlock more later and it's as simple as checking your face in a mirror to change literally any aspect of your little avatar's personal appearance.

Storage items are linked to your house storage. Namely your clothing. So basically not only will your wardrobe serve as a wardrobe (even if placed outdoors), but so will your fridge, your cooler, your safe, etc. It's a little silly, but honestly it's a nice way of having a way of changing your outfit wherever you go while blending the furniture in. Don't want a wardrobe outside just to change? Put a fishing cooler by the shore or something. It's great.

Second, you can place furniture items outside. This, combined with the much-touted island designer tool (place paths, pools or rivers of water and cliffs), allows you to make your town look the way you want it like New Leaf could only DREAM of achieving. Gone are the public works projects for a bench that take a whole day and a ludicrous amount of funding (and weird celebrations about a piece of furniture being delivered). Gone are the days of feeling like your town would take YEARS to look the way you want it to, with cheap paths that hitting the wrong button over would get rid of (though that feature is still there for custom design paths and I HATE IT; fix this, Nintendo).

Now if you want to have a bench outside Able Sisters for your villagers to rest their buns, you just find a bench (or build one yourself with the handy new crafting system) and place it. That's it. You can even move it around like it was inside of your house.

Third, as mentioned, CRAFTING. Many people were worried about this when it was introduced and there are valid complaints about it that even I have, but this is 100% a change for the better, it really is. Yes, your tools now break. And that sucks. Especially since all tools break now and you can't even check durability, but making them is easy enough and that's only a small part of what this system offers. There are tons of basic, unique and holiday-oriented craftable items that you can make over and over if you're dedicated enough to find the recipes, the materials and make them. And since getting recipes is a daily affair (every day there will be a bottle on the beach with a random, hopefully new, recipe in it), you're going to discover tons of cool new stuff every week, as long as you keep turning Animal Crossing on and messing about.

Fourth, Nook Miles. I don't think I've heard anyone complain about this. And no one should. It's nothing but a good thing to give you incentives to do stuff like fish, catch bugs, hunt fossils, talk to villagers, etc. It's encouragement in the form of ""miles"" to get you to play the game, where you can then redeem those miles for special recipes and items for yourself and your town. Custom phone case, fence recipes (fences are great for customization and another perk of the new game), furniture items, nook miles tickets to go to a randomized island and hunt collectible fish/bugs and resources.

You'll first start off with static, one-time-only rewards like a couple hundred miles for catching 10 bugs, then a thousand or so for 100, then catch 200+ and you get 2,000 miles (along with titles for your villager's passport, if that at all interests you, which you also get miles for editing once). Then after paying off your vacation package with those earned miles, you can build a house and start earning miles in the form of daily, renewable objectives (shoot a balloon down for some miles or assess x number of fossils) so you never run out of things to keep working towards if you want to keep yourself busy. It's great motivation to keep playing, though eventually it does become a bit bland, I won't lie. Still, I like having it.

I've run out of characters, sadly. It's a fun game.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
anarcheril,16-04-2020,"I thought I hadn't played this game, but it turns out I've been the 9th player the whole time missing out on little more than player 2-8, in fact I'd say I'm much more satisfied at my rating.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
sludacris,12-04-2020,"This game is delightful.

I'm writing this review to counteract the people giving it a ZERO because they don't like the one-island setup. Yeah, you don't like it, I get it. People are getting hundreds of hours of entertainment from a $60 game. There is literally nothing else in life that gives that much money-to-entertainment ratio. Even the cost of another Switch factored in (plus all the other games you'd play on it and be entertained by), it is still a great deal. The single island thing is definitely a cash grab move, but is still better than most companies doing the micro-transaction thing. The hours of entertainment involved with modern systems/games far outweigh the cost involved (when compared to other types of entertainment, such as movie theaters or dinner or theme parks, etc etc).

Actual criticism about the game itself:

I don't like that when you BUY stuff you get a chance to buy something else without restarting the conversation, but when you SELL stuff, you can sell that one thing and then have to start the conversation over. Only a minor annoyance, though.

I wish that in the out-of-doors, you could get an idea of where you're about to set an item down (and how big of a space it needs). You spend a lot of time guessing and then getting an alert that there isn't space there. In time, you get a better idea. Again, just a minor annoyance.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

There is a lot to do, and the gameplay loop is quite satisfying. There is one major issue I have with this game though that prevents it from getting a perfect score, and that is equipment breaking. Its really annoying and even the golden tools can break. That turns what was the ultimate reward in AC for the Gamecube, to a waste of resources in ACNH, and its a real bummer.

Honestly, I cant reccomend this game highly enough, especially with what's been going on in the world, it's really helped me out. I have some amazing villagers at the moment like Sherb, Marina, Beau, Aurora, Marshal and Stitches and their personalities and traits are a pleasure to be around.

Kabegami,28-06-2020,"Game was pretty fun at first, it however quickly becomes boring due to lack of content. Fans say its to span out recurring players by adding back ditched content later, but I was bored after the first month anyway so that didn't turn out well for them, the updates are way too small and far in between and I can't rate this game based on what it will become, that's Bethesda territory. Previous games supposedly had plenty of stuff like Nintendo themed furniture and exploring islands with friends, but here there's none of that and I don't care if they add it later, its not the game you get on cartridge. You should however keep all the content, and add on top of it. Not remove them and add them later like they're doing here.

Everything takes forever, building new bridges and relocating a house takes a day and you can't do more than one, all this to just drag your time without a good reason, which is why people time travel, if you want to discourage time travelling by removing content, how about not making things take so long to do and putting up so many roadblocks?

I do check back into it every few days but I'm never hyped to play more or partake in any tiny events Nintendo adds, they're completely deaf to fan feedback, like that infamous egg festival and the randomness of item recipes and such can lead to lack of tables to put stuff on, making you have to use cardboard boxes or place everything on the floor.

CosmicSurfer616,06-04-2020,"Tons to do compared to the original and WW which were the last two in the series I played. So I'll just keep this simple and list the Pros and Cons.
PROS: Tons to do around the island and always having an objective to work towards even if it is at your own pace it's nice to have something to work toward.
The island is always growing and gives you a real sense of progression. It really feels like you're building something great.
Many more residents per island then in the past and more variety when it comes to resident personality.
Over all graphics and visual presentation is great as well as sound design.
The ability to have local co-op is amazing and something I could've only dreamed of as a kid who I played the original with my brother on GameCube.
CONS: One Island per console I know this has been stated to death but it is ridiculous that in this day and age that it's not technically plausible.
The restrictions on co-op are a bit frustrating as I stated I'm stoked that they added local co-op but it just sucks they had to make it so stripped..If only they could've added a few more things, I mean simple things like both users being able to manage their menu instead of only the leader that's really all I wish they would've done honestly.. I wouldn't even ask for split screens or anything just the ability for both players to be able to pick up and sell items would've been amazing but instead it just feels like a half measure, it always ends up being a game of watching the leader do things or changing frequently so the other player can get stuff done. Frustrating because it could've been something so great.
Animal Crossing is what amounts to be an amazing game, it just struggles on the multiplayer side of things which has never been Nintendo's strong suit except when it comes to local play so how did they mess it up so bad? It's unfortunate because that is what keeps this from being a full 10 in my eyes. It just feels like maybe the local play was a last minute thing they threw in and didn't get the TLC it deserved.

EeveeAfterDark,07-04-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is absolutely gorgeous and relaxing switch game with some minor flaws that hold it back just a bit. The game starts you off from scratch as you have you have to build your own island basically all by yourself with only Tom Nook's small residential services tent in place to get you started. Not only do you have to pick a spot to put your tent to live but you also pick the locations of your first 2 villagers as well as future 8 other villagers as in order to keep with the starting from scratch theme you have to find most of your villagers yourself. Personally, I really like the idea of starting from scratch as it really feels like i have full control over my island and that everything on it has made because of me.

The game goes by real time and every single day you have something new to do such as picking fruit from your trees, hitting rocks to get materials such as iron nuggets and filling up your town museum with bugs, fish, and fossils you find. But in order to get buildings such as the museum to access more things you do, Tom Nook gives you tasks every day to help gain the access to new buildings and functions. The game is very relaxing to me as I can just go day by day slowly building up my town but not having to do everything all at once. It gives me a reason to come back every day.

The game heavily features a brand new crafting system that use to create almost everything on the island including your own tools. This is where my first small issue is, while the crafting is fantastic and adds to the experience, the tools that you use everyday can break unlike previous Animal Crossing games and it happens enough to be tedious to have to get the supplies and then re-craft them. Also kind of sucks is accounts on the same system all have to share an island instead of getting to create their own. Online multiplayer is a bit annoying as it has a very sluggish start as you always wait a few minutes for a cut scene to play as a new person arrives and even when they are there functions are limited on the island.

Though while these issues are certainly a pain in the butt at times it still isn't enough to deter from the lovely relaxing life simulation game that is Animal Crossing New Horizons. If you want something to just relax and play its definitely worth your time

I was hoping for way better gameplay quality from Nintendo. The main one being the multiplayer mode as many people said. I'm even more frustrated because this is a issue that designers couldn't not see. I tried mutiplayer with my girlfriend, but the feeling was really bad. And with the annoying animation each time you harvest as a companion makes you don't want to harvest anymore. On solo mode, if I harvest too much, My girlfriend will be mad because she has nothing to do and will be stuck. There are also other beginner issues. When you talk to sell or buy something, you are kicked out of the interraction and you have to retalk to the character again. Even Pokemon Red had this sort out! The wheel of tool control is bad. Aiming at fish is a pain in the ass. interractions are too long, even for a relaxing game. Finally, a little related to the multiplayer issue, the save fil management was the cue that told me that the game is unfinished. The issue is even address in the game with a animation!",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

cons: terraforming takes so much time and precision, there is not two specific buttons for building and destroying. the music is the same loop over and over. no multi-crafting = making 60 individual fishbaits. cannot buy multiple pieces of shirts or shoes at able shop. RIDICULOUS airline dialogue that takes more time to travel.whenever someone arrives on the island, shows stupid “how long it’ll take for them to get here” screen that interrupts EVERYBODYS gameplay.

The fact, that you cannot have more than one island per console is definetly a deal-breaker and rather despicable. Doing so was a conscious and calculated decicion by Nintendo, considering that having more islands was possible on previous versions. Charging 60 € or whatever currency you're using is far from okay and nothing but a shameless cash-grab. I do think that Nintendo deserves significant hate for their decicion and also think that my score is justified for this reason: A game, that forces family members to be some kind of slaves to whoever happened to start the game, does not deserve any rating above five and considering that there are many other things (visiting friends is difficult, villager dialogue is repetitive) I will not be ashamed of considering this to be a bad game overall.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

I want to make my own design decisions and have my wife do hers and look at how things pan out. NOPE. Second, the first person who plays gets to make ALL important decisions, where buildings go, the shape of the island, etc. Third, couch coop multiplayer forces only one person to be able to do worthwhile activity leaving the other players to weed and water.

NotoriousRPG,19-04-2020,"I’m beyond frustrated with this game, this is the first animal crossing I ever play, I know the new leaf players had it worst but this stressed me out.
I bought this game because everyone was raving about how awesome and relaxing it is, knowing we were going to be on lockdown I thought this was the perfect game for this! I’ve clocked many hours on stardew valley so I thought this was right up my alley, but it’s not.
The first days were very entertaining, everything is new and you feel progress in the course of the initial settlement of your very own island where you are the representative! But slowly but surely you become what you are escaping from in reality, just an employee, in this case, an employee of Tom nook.

You want a bridge? Pay up
You want a ramp? Pay up
You want to relocate a building? Pay up
More storage? Pay up
Another room? Pay up
Travel to random islands? Pay up Furniture? Pay up
Clothing? Pay up

Even the things you do daily consist on a exchange of currency, if you want to relocate a tree, you have to consume fruit to be able to relocate it, your tools break so you have to constantly get materials to craft them again.

And every time you move 1 ramp, one bridge or one building it takes 1 whole real life day, yeah, it won’t be finished until 5 am the next day, 1 ramp/bridge per day, if you want to destroy and build another bridge (you can’t relocate them, you have to pay again) you have to wait til the day after tomorrow! On the positive side the game looks gorgeous, there is an IMMENSE amount of items, furniture, clothing, wallpapers, floors etc The art of the game is impecable.

But the problem is that this is a game of collecting items and decorating, it may not be for everyone, there’s not much to do story-wise after you finish paying the 5 rooms you can expand on your home and achieve a 3 rating star on your island , so you are left with decorating and collecting items, and that’s it, a beautiful shell of a game with no much gameplay but shake trees and mine ores.

Also, you can’t build more than 8 ramps in your island, you can’t build ramps next to another, you can’t build a ramp that leads straight to your museum because they are made of 2 blocks and the museum is 5 blocks wide, the lack of symmetry on some parts makes me irrationally mad. The cherry on top is that you can only have 1 island per switch, the dialog is very unintuitive and the online functionality is ok but a pain if you have more than 2-3 visitors with unnecessary repetitive loading animations.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

SirPigeon,20-04-2020,"I don't understand why this game is so highly praised, after about a month of owning it I can say its 'just okay'.

When you start the game, you're drawn in by the charm of the character designs and the laid back feeling. You aren't pressed for time and can do what you want. I spent my first two weeks catching a wide variety of creatures to fill the museum, creating my own house and trying to make money.

However, I then spent the next two weeks doing the exact same thing.
You need allot of money to progress in this game, so you're going to have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell. Once you upgrade your house you are then presented with another option to upgrade (progress in the game, essentially) so you'll have to go catch creatures and craft items to sell so you can get another upgrade and do the same thing again and again.

This isn't just limited to the main game either, filling out the museum requires you to spend hours catching fish and bugs over and over and finding fossils (you have high chances to keep getting creatures and fossils you've found before).

The character dialogue? repeating. You start to notice the same dialogue being used over and over after about a week or so of playing, and while that may be fine normally this is a game that's supposed to be some sort of long term investment and is praised for its supposed 'small details' and charm, which I found ran out after the first week as the game kept trying to repeat the same tricks over and over to try and impress and engage me. This game is essentially a one trick pony, after the initial 'wow' there's not much left to be impressed by.

Its fun at first but everything about this game screams repetition, its more like a chore than a fun game.

There are 3 stones on my island and not 1 gave me an iron nugget, meaning I have to constantly spend Nook Miles to go to other islands so I can get them, it took me multiple days just to complete that task due to bad RNG. And don't get me started on the 3 plot stuff...6 items per plot, and some of the materials needed for said items I cannot get on my island at all, which means MORE grinding for Nook Miles to travel to other islands for them to potentially not even have the materials I need. I just want to be able to have villagers on my island without having to constantly grind.

I'll give it to Nintendo that the animal residents are adorable. It's why I was dragged to the game in the first place, which looking back was a huge mistake. With all the content it has, I can see why it's being sold for £50, but the gameplay itself doesn't make up for it. If you want a game like Minecraft that has cute, interactive animal villagers and 10x more grinding for materials, then this game is absolutely for you. But sadly, it was not for me at all.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Froggie,21-04-2020,"I’ve bought this game for playing solo, and seeing how pretty much everyone enjoys it that way, I thought I would too. And to my disappointment, it was such a chore that it became boring after two weeks of playing.
Some of the aspects that killed the game for me:

1. Grind. I initially expected the game to be kind of similar to Stardew Valley. There, you were always rewarded for everything: catching new species, donating items to the museum, talking and giving gifts to the villagers (aka getting cutscenes and gifts).
What is the situation like in ACNH? Want to travel to mystery islands (actually a one very cool feature), want some cool hairstyles? You gotta get nook miles. And in order to get them, you’re given the most enjoyable tasks ever imaginable: chop 10 trees, catch 10 bugs, sell 20 weed. It was getting so tedious I wanted to CRY. People actually spend 60$ on this and enjoy it??

Museum is actually really beautiful on the inside, I did not expect it at first. But the sensation wears off real quick, because essentially it’s all this game is about - looks. Nothing rewarding in terms of gameplay.

2. Villagers. Again, can be pretty, but they all have the same cookie cutter cutter cute and lovely personality. Maybe it’s me who’s got so unlucky, i don’t know. But you can develop even characters like this, but all I got is some copy paste bs monologue about how that one likes to sleep and eat, and that other one likes to lift weights. Amazing.

3. The time you have to spend to do such routine like buying or selling. Like honestly, do I REALLY need to stop to read greetings every time I walk into the shop, followed by ANOTHER line when I try to talk to them?? To then watch how my character hands them the goods, and they talk pointlessly??
Optimize the menus for god’s sake and stop making everything so slow. You can make immersive game without trying to artificially drag out things like selling, buying and crafting, especially when you’re doing it so frequently...

4. It was actually partially my fault for not reading about the game enough, but real time synchronization is stupid. You want to build a home, a bridge, or literally anything? Wait for one day. Want to see new clothes? Wait one day. Want to have fun right now? Unlucky for you, wait one day.
I could get behind this idea if it wouldn’t have hindered me from doing what I want when I want. Why can’t I move quickly with the game if I want to? Why is this game forcing one play style on everyone?

I know you can time travel, which I usually do, even though it kinda feels like cheating. And you know why? Because if you do that, it’s extremely apparent that the game relies on that real time gimmick to be interesting. It severely lacks any real content.
I believe you will enjoy the ACNH if you like customizing stuff, because it’s one thing the game is objectively good at.

All in all, I really, REALLY tried to like this game. But you can only catch bugs for so long.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
asiantuntija,22-04-2020,I spent 60 e on the game and also had to buy a memory card to be able to download it. Now it turned out that only one profile can own an island and others are just guests. So now I have one happy kid and one sad. I’m very disappointed at Nintendo. They better fix it. It’s 2020 – there surely aren’t any technical restrictions preventing each profile from having an own island.,0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Killerkirin,22-04-2020,"This is a review that comes from a secondary user of the game.

While the game in itself is fantastic, peaceful and brilliant. I have never been more disappointed by a game. This probably comes as my partner and I were excited for this game to come out for a long time. The unfortunate truth is that you cannot create multiple island for multiple users. This is absolutely disappointing as it shows how much Nintendo wants people to buy more of its products. I have never given a review before and I am extremely sadden by the fact the developers completely ruined the game for me as I cannot have my own story, my own adventure.

I'd be totally fine with sharing the island with my kid if both of us could complete main story quests but only the first player to establish the island gets to progress the story. So even though I created my own character on the same island, all I can do is collect things and wait for the first player to eventually progress the island. It makes it where I don't even want to play anymore because what is the point? Just a terribly stupid choice from Nintendo that will probable turn me off these games for good.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

To put my on review though I would say this game is good, I've so far enjoyed my experience and that's as a solo player even then I'm disappointed in the solo save feature, I've seen that apparently having 8 people on one island is ""multiple saves"" but that isn't true, that's one save for multiple people. I can see that critic reviews are positive and I can only imagine that they won't actually play this game like most intend or like family with one console for the family. Silly idea for a brilliant game, and all for the money. Very sad.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
Canine,22-04-2020,"This game har AMAZING potential but the experience is absolutely 100% ruined for a couple who shares one switch, solely because of the 1 island per console combined with the RIDICULOUS second resident restrictions. I would accept the fact that we have to share one island together but not the fact that 2nd player doesnt get to play the game. Either we should be able to have seperate islands for each user or let all residents have full access to the shared island!",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
daveccrit,22-04-2020,"So, I bought this game specifically because it stated it was 1 - 2 players on the box. To my disappointment, it is NOT 2 players. It is 1 Player with a helper. I really like the game, but that was a clear case of false advertising, and the company should be sued. The first player to start the game chooses the island that everyone local will be ""playing"" on. The first player is the ONLY player who gets to choose where the new residents go. They are the only player that can trigger main events to progress the story. Only one player can visit other islands at a time, you can't go together. All of the main events can only be triggered by the first player. The first player is the only one who can choose where bridges and ramps get placed. On top of this, other accounts on the switch can NOT create their own island, they are stuck being helpers on this one island, so forget buying this game for the family, it was a waste of money. Multiplayer games are not new, split screen is not new, so do the decision makers for this game have their heads in the sand? Next time hire people who know what they're doing when making multiplayer games.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
benacious,23-04-2020,"Being limited to a single island ruins this game. I shouldn't ever even have to wonder if a game can be played with different accounts. It's common sense. I just bought a switch, which was a horrible experience with the current stock shortage, specifically so my wife and I can each play this game, have our own islands, and share our individual experiences. My jaw is still laying on the floor after learning that you are stuck with a single island that all users must share. I'm not even given the (bad) option of buying a second copy of the game to open up the option for a 2nd island. This is an awful, awful design decision. If the motivation is to stop cheating, first of all, why would the devs care if somebody is cheating at a single player life simulator? Ruining the experience for multiple players within the household only creates a bigger problem. Until this game is patched with a reasonable option for individual players on the same console to have their own individual experiences, this game is worthless to me and many others. The entire premise of this game is having YOUR own island and making it YOURS. This is a horrible, horrible move that needs fixed immediately.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Batmanishguy,23-04-2020,"I really like this game, and personally for myself alone it's a 10/10. But the fact that my roomate can't play the game at all mean's it's a very valid 0. I've read people saying that a 0 is non nonsensical, However, this is a game play rating, and this setup allows for literally 0 game for him to play. How is that not a 0? Roaming around my island with nothing to do is not a game, it's an interactive museum at best (coincidentally, this game has an amazing museum set up!).

I digress, assuming you're actually able to play it, it's a very good game. Super fun to build up an island, collecting artifacts is surprisingly fun! I'm in the end game and having the ability to terraform is amazing! I love creating things, and hunting for bugs and fish! I also love visiting friends (outside my own household) islands and snagging fruits I don't have.

Any who, if there is a 1:1:1 ratio between people who are going to be playing, game cartridges owned, and game consoles owned. I HIGHLY suggest it, especially if you have friends who play it. If that ratio is off, there's no way I can suggest it. It's too good to not be able to share fully.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
CaptainOfTgeSky,23-04-2020,I (mostly) thoroughly enjoy this game but am getting increasingly frustrated with some of the mechanics. The biggest ones are of course the 1 island rule which is honestly INSANE to me. But I also find the design downloader quite annoying. Why can't I edit designs I download? Even if I copy then? Makes no sense. The crafting gets really monotonous because you have to do it one at a time and I would love to see you be able to craft using your storage inventory,3,ACNH,METACRITIC
SpookyFoxx,23-04-2020,Pretty short sighted and money hungry to force households to have 1 island per console. Every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves except this one. Just shows Nintendo is no better than the rest of the shady AAA gaming industry.,0,ACNH,METACRITIC

surajdave,23-04-2020,"This game would be a 10 but there is one huge flaw. Nintendo refuses to let you have a different island per user. And will require you to purchase another console.

Not being able to skip cut-scenes and skip dialogue kills me. If you do have to share an island, the person who didn't make the island doesn't have control over anything.

Darbi,27-04-2020,"Yea, yea, I know. Please read fully, I promise not to be the typical bad review, though, I have the rating so low for the same reasons. I have always seen Nintendo as a family connecting platform. Some of my fondest memories are playing Mario kart, super smash, and Wii sports on the Wii. My sister got a switch for her birthday and I never really thought much of it. But when New horizons released she was eager to let me jump in. I have never played animal crossing, but this was outstandingly a great experience, I fell in love. But I struggled to help her build homes, and wasn't treated the same, nor did I interact with importance with Tom, I felt discriminated against. I soon learned why, with the one island per console, and the founder having all the decision making, really, really, really sucked. I would have loved to then start my own island, or co-run the one we were in. I couldn't choose where buildings went, I couldn't progress, and I couldn't even invite villagers, one of the most important and enjoyable aspects of the entire game! I was stuck, and worst of all... This literally damaged my relationship with my sister. I'm twice her age and I felt we finally found a way to bond, but no, Nintendo turned from a ""family connecting"" idea, to a ""family tearing"" nightmare. I absolutely hate it, and I can't play it anymore, and that has led my sister to stop, and now I feel guilty, and everything is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. How could a overly family friendly game turn into a despair-enducing experience. However, it's still a 4 because if you were solo this game is absolutely perfect, but this game is built around socializing and family, and it decided it wanted to ruin both. If you want to play with anymore then a SINGLE person, which is what was frost attractive about the game, then DON'T BUY.

NINTENDO... Please, I beg you to rethink your decision. Make multiple islands where others can found, or make a co-founder system where both share absolutely the SAME privileges.

kieransteeves,29-04-2020,"New Horizons is so close to being an amazing game, but Nintendo's shortcomings, oversight, or negligent understanding of the modern game environment means the game falls short. The game is pretty, polished, and cute. However it feels like a relic of the past. The major shortcoming of ACNH is how the game plays when trying to play with friends. There is nothing to do with your friends. You cannot build things together. You cannot paint together, decorate together, or even use basic terminal functions when someone is on your island. You can't sell things on a friends island if you are playing too late at night. if someone tries to come to your island they will not be able to if you have a dialog box open. When a person comes everyone involved will have to wait through a lengthy loading screen. If anyone disconnects everyone's progress will be lost.

AlexxaLynn,20-05-2020,"Tldr: 2 stars because I LOVE this game, but the deal breaker of a problem I have with it could have easily been prevented with just the tiniest bit of forethought and whatever short amount of time it would have taken to add a warning message at startup of the game. Don't start playing on a shared device!

I've been obsessed with this game since I started playing a little over a week ago. I'd never even touched my husband's switch before, or another Animal Crossing game, so I had no idea that when he added me as a second player I would basically get to play one tenth of the actual game. It's probably a little dramatic, but I was devastated when I realized that I would never be able to progress the game on my own just because my husband made his account first. I really don't care about buying another console/game to have my own island, but the thought of doing that now after all of the effort/hours I've already put into the game makes me think I'm just going to give it up entirely. I really wish that at the very, very least there had been a warning when setting up an additional player on the game so I could have just bought a second switch before I got so far into it. This is the only problem I've found with the game, but it's a deal breaker to me and apparently a lot of other ACNH players. I've seen quite a few good suggestions of how to fix this, including adding the ability to switch between designated primary players or allowing the data to be transferred to another device via the cloud storage.

Pero a mi eso no me acaba de gustar del todo. Os explico, al principio esta bien ya que contruyes tus cosas y eso, pero con el paso del tiempo se vuelve monótono y aburrido ya que no tienes misiones y has remodelado la isla como quieres.

Phishion,25-07-2020,"A large number of collection elements and beautiful islands with changing day and night, weather and seasons form the base of this game, and the behavioral design of the rich and varied animal villagers makes the player no longer lonely, greatly enhancing the player's sense of agency, sense of mission, and making the island full of life. The game gives players different goals in the short and medium term, as well as well-designed incentives of different levels and frequencies to ensure the player's attention. In addition, the game is designed with considerable restraint in terms of the resources given to the player, which ensures that the game is fresh for long periods of time, even in single player mode. All in all, this is a game that allows the player to self-actualize step by step, always making additions.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

1. Terrible UI designed to make you take the maximum number of clicks to do any single action

2. After you've set up your island.. there's really nothing else to do. It's really not a very replayable game.

ppk,04-07-2020,"Initially I didn't think I'd like this game and waited until July 2020 to start playing after my brother and nephew gave it high marks. To me it sounded too much like Minecraft--an exercise in tedium. Fortunately there is much more going on here, to me. Already the game is quite addictive in that certain game mechanics ""reset"" at the start of a new day (such as harvesting and long-duration builds completing). I've not yet visited another island as the cost is still a bit too high. The synced world time is pretty interesting as well as certain things are available based on TOD--I've never played a game like this. To think that there are seasonal elements is quite exciting--can't wait until Halloween!

So far, the cons are the highly irritating character voices that can't be muted; after the initial few minutes I was wishing I could just do away with it. Cycling through the menus is rather tedius.

Mossagon,13-07-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is a overall solid game but I can’t really bring myself to say that I personally enjoy it. It has its place for people who can tolerate how slow the game is and its repetitive gameplay loop, but I don’t think that it suits me.
The general gameplay loop is slowly upgrading your island, catching creatures to submit to Blathers, visiting new smaller islands, and that’s where it about ends. I never have a great motivation to make my island look nice or to do anything for its inhabitants due to them often feeling robotic or one note caricatures such as this guy is strong, this girl is moody, and that’s their whole personality. It’s worthy to note that your islanders personality rarely play a part in your daily gameplay, the only islanders you interact with frequently (The shoo vendors) have set in stone personalities that don’t factor into anything. So all in all it makes villagers just feel like side attractions/decorations instead of a motivator to continue upgrading your island for you and its inhabitants. To make your island look great you need tons of bells, which turnips become the primary way to farm them later on, which I dislike since they feel so disconnected to actual gameplay. In terms of the other parts of the loop, catching creatures is admittedly tedious but rewarding so I don’t have much to say on that note. But one thing I think everyone can agree on is the major design oversights that honestly I don’t have any idea how they got past play-testing. Crafting one object at a time, a long drawn out arriving cutscene that despawns any creatures near you whenever someone arrives, and more just take a noticeable toll on my enjoyment due to bow frankly annoying they are in this type of game. This isn’t to say that there’s nothing good about this game, the amount of things you can collect, your customizability, multiplayer, and general aesthetic are all things to take into account. The character designs are adorable, and nothing about the game aside from those oversights really frustrates me, but it’s just not my cup of tea. If you’re into those games where you can collect tons of stuff, and are a fan of its slow pace and relaxed nature, I’d say it’s for you. My final rating is a 6/10 which in my terms is a game worth playing if it suits you well.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

Macguy9,26-07-2020,"Recently, we purchased Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a reward for my son, who had saved up half of the cost with his allowance. He was excited to play the game, as my wife and I had played every previous version and had told him how much fun it was. We were all looking forward to playing the game and enjoying watching the island build up and grow. When the day arrived, he was the first to log in and play. My wife and I then created characters and started farming and building our homes. Then, the first major 'milestone' arrived. He started working on the quest, then went out for the day. I decided to log in to my account and help out with his quest. Imagine my surprise when I couldn't. Essentially, I was not the 'main' character, and not allowed to progress the main story line. I was disappointed, to say the least. Although I had put quite a number of hours into the game already and built up my home and character, and didn't want to lose that... I was consoled by the idea that I could always start another island and experience the main storyline that way. After all, the Switch has multiple user accounts, right? Wrong. Apparently I have to buy another game copy AND console if I want to experience the game I paid for in full. Or delete my son's island and start over, which I'm not about to do. This is an incredibly poor design choice on Nintendo’s part. Not allowing separate islands? Or allowing multiple players in a *multiplayer game* to have full access to the game features? Ridiculous. This may be the last Nintendo console I allow in my household. I will certainly be scrutinizing their software with independent reviewers very closely before allowing any future purchases in our household.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

JuicyApple724,24-06-2021,"I can't believe it... After digging nearly 400 hours into New Leaf on the 3DS, I was patiently awaiting the next iteration on Nintendo's newest console. I was just as excited as everybody else was when the game was first teased and then announced; getting hyped to yet again to be fully immersed in the island life.

It's too bad that this game was such a magnificient disappointment!

I started to play this as soon as I got it as an Easter gift, I started putting in many hours and... something wasn't clicking. Unlike New Leaf, where I would have sleepless nights waiting to enter my village for the next day, this game gave me no such feeling. I also played New Leaf consistently for about three years, yet this game became boring to me after about a month. So what gives?

Firstly, there are a few positive things to praise the game for (although mostly minor in the grand scheme of things). The graphics are gorgeous in the game, and the miniscule details added along with them like Villagers now doing activities is so fun to see! The Soundtrack, while it is inferior in comparison to the wonderful soundtrack of previous Animal Crossing games (Especially New Leaf), is still very nice to hear and I enjoy the songs.

With that out of the way, let's get into the many negative aspects. For starters, there's nothing to do! In New Leaf you could shop on Main Street, do errands and play minigames with villagers, visit the island with friends, go thrifting, enjoy tourneys and other special events, and plenty more! New Horizons is just... bare bones (which is quite applicable for the state of the game as a whole.). Special Characters and many shops have been gutted from the game. As you can see in some other reviews here, the developers also promised frequent updates to the game which would add in more content and even gave me and others the hope that many characters and shops would return... Nope! A year in and the updates have been incredibly lackluster, adding in nothing of note ( Well except for content that was ALREADY IN PREVIOUS GAMES). Holidays and Tourneys are God Awful in New Horizons. For example, in a New Leaf Fishing/Bug Tourney you would be competing with all the villagers in your town on catching the largest bug/fish. Whoever caught the largest by the end of the day would be placed in the top 3 and receive a trophy and maybe even special furniture for their achievements. In New Horizons the tourneys are... You against yourself? They instead opted for simply catching the most bugs/fish in an allotted time limit to get a prize. That takes away the fun and soul of a tourney. You would also think the events would be better but that is also a lie, some events are months long where all you do is the same stuff (cough cough wedding day). Speaking of soul being ripped out, let's talk about the villagers. It used to be fun and charming talking with your villagers everyday in New Leaf. You would slowly build up friendships by visiting each other's houses, completing errands, playing games, etc... In New Horizons this has all been sacrificed and Villagers have been made cute objects to look at instead of actual living villagers... The big gimmick of this game is the customization of your island with terraforming, decorating, and crafting being buffed or newly added features. Crafting becomes monotonous and grindy when you have to grind resources from your island day after day, making none of this new system fun for me at all. Animal Crossing should be a game where I can escape the stresses of life and relax, not have to grind for some stupid iron ore in a rock! Oh and by the way Nintendo, drip feeding through updates is not how you make previous Animal Crossing players want to come back to your game!

It pains me to say it but I really cannot recommend this game. Another reviewer here mentioned how this game is more like a ""Happy Home Deluxe"" where the game is great with decorating and customization, but forgot everything else that makes Animal Crossing Animal Crossing. If you want a true Animal Crossing experience, pick up a 3DS and play New Leaf, by far the better game. I entered this game thinking this could be one of Nintendo's greatest series, now I'm left shivering at the future of Animal Crossing Games.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
Gamer525,25-06-2021,"It's a good game with wasted potential, it was worthy of being the best animal crossing game, it had a lot of potential, like editing the Minecraft-style terrain, also in crafting things, like the minecraft crafting table, but just Nintendo and its developers, they did not know how to implement it well, the manufacturing is very bad, in capital letters! It is very tedious to find the iron, stone and clay, the terrain, it becomes very repetitive, after a few days pass, the developers did not know how to implement it well.

Music is just MEH

AC ACCF and ACNL, has great music, which made identifying the games in an excellent way, especially new leaf, it has the best music of the entire saga, examples are, 1am, 8am, 1pm and 5pm, you can feel it identified.

In New Horizons?

His music can be meh, bad, mediocre, I say that his music is very repetitive and bad, it does not fit the environment, which in this case is an island, for me, almost all of them are bad , with the exceptions of 12pm, 8pm, 3pm and 5pm, which do give a tropical atmosphere.

Its graphics are good, to be a 2020 game on switch, although in the animal neighbors, many do not convince me, they look a little plastic, cheer them up, but that is forgiven.

The mechanics are terrible!

In later installments, Nintendo was forgiven, that you could only generate a world, for 4 players, but in new horizons, that is no longer forgiven.

It's just ridiculous, like that one island? If the switch, being a more powerful console than the wii u, can support several maps, that is, do I have to pay another $ 400 for a switch and the game? it is no longer tolerable.

The animal neighbors, they became someone without personality or soul, in new leaf or later installments, your neighbors wanted to meet you, you could see their personality in them, they were like people or friends of yours, that you could do many things, such as invite them to your home .exchange things, play among others.

In new horizons, they just became puppets without personality, you can no longer do that, which later installments offered you, they are careless and you cannot talk to them so much, I limit myself a bit to that.

updates.

The updates, from 1.0.0 to 1.9.0, could be in the base game, it is an excuse, so that Nintendo can extend the life of the game, in my opinion, the updates themselves are bad, almost not brings nothing new, just a couple of sets and the events, which could be in the base game, as I repeat.

In conclusion, this game is not for that fan of ancient animal crossing, if you are looking for a delivery, that you simulate a life with animals and feel identified, because this game is not for you, play new leaf, city folk and that of game Cube.

but if you want to hang out, this game is for you.

The long, repetitive, dialogue is tedious, the music is bland and sounds boring, and the whole game, in general, is indeed, boring. I've give it one thing though. It's visually stunning. You can walk and run with no lag, and browse around. The items also look pretty good, and the bugs and fish look stunning in the museum (once you build it). Considering how I got this on sale though, I can't give it a negative rating. I got it for $30, instead of $60, but if I did get it for $60, I would give it a 3 or 4. At least the museum is visually stunning, and looks nice. At least there's not a lot of lag. The controls are basic. Whatever. I can't think of anything more to say, so I'll leave it here.

First it was really interesting and I played almost the whole day, but when I was finished with the main part ( having all the villagers, having all shops/ houses and being happy with how my island turned out) it got boring very quickly. I didn't play for weeks now because I have nothing to do. I have to say that Animal Crossing New Leaf was much better except for the graphics. The villagers were fun and you could to talk to them without them telling u the same few phrases over and over again like in New Horizons. Also it had much more shops and locations like the island with its mini games, the hairdresser and many more. In conclusion I think New Horizons is a fun game but compared to New Leaf it's being left on track.
Also it's bothering me, why couldn't nintendo just take New Leaf upgrade it a little bit and leave it there, bet that would've been outsold too in no time...",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
JstAnthrGmr,19-10-2021,"I love the animal crossing franchise don’t get me wrong.. but this game just has so many disappointments I had to say something. It has been over a year and they are JUST NOW adding characters to the game that we have had in almost every other game in the series so far from the beginning. Also with all the updates, and knowing what people are most upset about they have not fixed the issue of one island per switch. It is unrealistic to expect everyone in the household will have their own switch just for this game. It was more reasonable to think that with the 3DS and even then multiple cartrigas got you multiple islands. On the GameCube multiple memory cards meant multiple saves. On the switch it’s one island per switch and everyone who uses that CONSOLE (as much as they want it to also be a handheld, it’s a console) has to live on the same island and only the person who starts the file actually gets any real say in how the island progresses. That makes it so that no one else really gets to enjoy the full game. If you have multiple family members sharing a switch that want to play the full game prepare to be disappointed. This fix would not be hard but they chose to ignore the issue in the hopes maybe people will buy more consoles? The new update coming is so large they definitely could have made this part of it and they didn’t. Now that they finally “finished” the game they released too early over a year later they are starting to release paid dlc? Not surprised they are mostly concerned with money and not their actual fan base.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
ampz55,04-11-2021,"I bought the game for me and my 6 year old daughter to play separately, occasionally together with co-op. One save file per game is not ideal whatsoever. A 6 year old playing a game like this can be chaotic, to put it lightly. Not being able to have my OWN personal experience in this game is a gigantic downfall.

stibba,21-11-2021,"Disappointing.

i've seen very polarising reviews here, on one hand you have game critics universally giving every game a 9/10 and never critiquing anything, not this game either. And on the other hand you have the barrage of user reviews slamming a 0/10 because of stuff unrelated to the game or not being able to have several islands per copy. Im gonna try to save gaming and actually review the game.

Animal crossing is in everyway except for graphical fidelity a step down from new leaf.
After the tutorial there is no real progression and it really shines a light on how little there is to do in the game. You can go grind ingredients for recipes you dont have, listen to the 4 possible repeating sentences your villagers can say, or catch bugs/fish. Why is talking to your villagers such a bore? talking to them brings up a submenu basically asking ""are you sure you want to listen to the repeated dialogue again?"". In new leaf, you could talk to villagers for a long time before they started repeating themselves, i really dont know why it is so limited here, since its such a crucial aspect of the game.

With these main gripes clear, i would like to say that the game isnt all bad, designing your island and home is fun. Fishing is also fun, filling up your museum is the replacement for any progression the game otherwise lacks.

Overall this is a clear downgrade and the praise the game has gotten (perhaps because of release timing and new players) is not promising. I would recommend new leaf over this every day of the week, and you'll save 30 euro!

Animal Crossing New Horizons emphasizes the customization aspect of the experience more than ever before, giving players the option to place indoor furniture outside as well, but most importantly the power to shape the island's landscape to create rivers, cliffs or change the appearance of specific ground tiles. This greatly enchances the decor possibilities, as well as providing much more furniture and clothing options than New Leaf. Even with this, New Leaf offered many more shops and a greater sense of progression with time, whereas New Horizons's town feels stale and empty with only a couple of shops and almost no upgrades. Compounding this problem are villagers, offering an embarassingly low amount of lines of dialogue that start repeating themselves after mere weeks. Furthermore, their personalities have been simplified and infantilized, leaving most interactions feeling artificial. The new crafting mechanic tries to add some flavor to the acquiring of items and furniture through resource management, but its great potential isn't explored nearly enough as it ends up being more of an annoyance, with tools breaking too often. With all these downgrades, uncertain new mechanics and the usual repetitive nature of Animal Crossing's core activities, New Horizons ends up being little more than a visually pleasing but hollow display of aesthetics and virtual possessions.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

I bought it and let my roommate play it first while I finished up work and by the next day I loved the town already at which point I discover (which had not been mentioned anywhere prior to the games release) that he had all the control in perpetuity and there is nothing I can do about it. Now I'm five days in and not going to delete it but oh my god please Nintendo, let us at least switch the island representative if not let everyone spruce up the town.

I would have rated this game 9/10 for its slow start and lack of camera freedom, but I'm rating it a 10/10 to counterbalance all the reviews that forget to actually review the game and its merit rather than a single one of its flaws. I do not believe that a game so fun, heart-warming, charming, and immersive should receive such a low user rating solely because it doesn't specifically tailor to your needs. I can acknowledge the problem, and sure it really sucks, but it isn't representative of literally everything else about this game. In my mind, this game is a near masterpiece and I cannot wait to continue playing it. If you have multiple people that want to play on the same console, I acknowledge that your experience will be hindered due to Nintendo's admittedly greedy policies.

It feels like I'm going to have done everything there is to do within a month.
And that doesn't even touch on the multiplayer nonsense. You're limited to one island per console, so player two doesn't get a full experience. Player 1 controls the island, every other player is just a permanent visitor with very little control.

All other people/characters on the Nintendo Switch console who join the island are blocked from core story content, from progressing the island, and from unlocking recipes. They are essentially ""guest"" characters, for temporary and throwaway use.

This is not communicated anywhere in the game, so it's possible to go weeks or months building your island before realising that when your flatmate or sibling leaves/moves out, you will be completely blocked from progressing because they were the ""main"" villager.

sarthek,24-03-2020,"In brief: it's impressive that Nintendo managed to create a family game that in no way caters for families.

The issues with the primary resident versus other players is are well documented, so I won't rehash them here. What's particularly disappointing is that anyone could have foreseen this: it's a family game and, given that there's only one island per Switch console, more than one person is likely to want to play it (unless you've got a very small family).

It would not have been difficult to allow players 2+ to contribute to things like building new houses, but instead they're just left out in the cold. In this particular case they can read the construction sign, but cannot see the requirements or provide materials without sending them to the primary player.

It makes a certain sort of sense to only allow one person to make significant modifications to the island, but even then it would not be a particularly big ask to allow the primary player to grant the rights to players 2+.

Similarly, resources like rocks are relatively limited and are handled on a per-island basis: that is, if one player harvests the rock (by hitting it with a shovel - you can get up to eight items per rock without destroying it) no other player can harvest that rock the same day. Because of this, sharing resources between two people is challenging – three or more must be a nightmare.

Nook points to get tickets to semi-random islands to harvest are a partial solution, but the rate at which one can gather Nook points slows rapidly as you progress through the game to the point where this looks like it's going to cease to be viable very soon (5-6 days into the game).

Overall I'm really, really disappointed and I generally expect a lot more from Nintendo when it comes to games that can be played by the whole family. I'm not sure what Nintendo's goal here is; perhaps that we should have a Switch AND copy of the game per member of the household? If so, that's a losing bet, for sure.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

It's been 7 years since a mainline Animal Crossing, and this perfectly revives the series from its grave of spin offs. If people are complaining about a single island per console, or a stripped down version of other family members villagers, the game has normally had a lesser experience for new villagers, because they did not FOUND THE ISLAND. About the single island, it was announced long before and is disappointing, but doesn't break and ruin the game.

I have been waiting for two generations to be able to play Animal Crossing, because I wasn’t interested on playing on my daughters island previously, and I thought that finally I could get my own island as Switch OS has own profiles for each player for each game.

But what is this!? I should buy two more Switches and three copies of the game so that my daughters can get their own islands and I could get my own?

What if my Wife wants to play? I need to buy a fourth Switch!?!

This Switch deal is getting worse and worse.

bon-s,24-03-2020,"I love Animal Crossing, but I cannot give this game anything higher than 0 because of just how ridiculously and blaringly obvious some flaws are.

-One island per console. Families or couples are locked behind whatever the first player profile has done. You cannot progress if the other islander has played less than you. This is absolutely intentional by Nintendo as to entice you to have one Switch per person. Greed.

-Online multiplayer is a joke. Even when you have people added as best friends, you cannot place any furniture. It gets incredibly boring very quickly when all you can do is fish and catch bugs with friends. At least on New Leaf you could go to Tortimer's Island, to meet new people or with friends, you could play minigames and grind expensive bugs and fish.

-No dream towns, which was a fantastic way to check out themed towns. On that note, now it's much harder to theme your town as shops etc are not in a separate instance i.e high street.

-Duplication glitch has absolutely demolished the trading community. Anyone that isn't cheating cannot buy anything for a reasonable price anymore. How there hasn't been a small patch for nearly a week now is crazy.

It honestly just feels like a big step backwards for the franchise. Some pros so it's not all negative below:

-Graphics are beautiful

-You can move trees, bamboo and buildings

-Terraforming

My other issue (and this one is huge, in my opinion) is the limitations placed on each console. The fact that it is not only 1 island per console, but that’s it’s only one primary player per console is ridiculous. I’ve heard people argue that this is the same as what they did with new leaf... it’s not. The switch is a $400 FAMILY console. It has numerous games marketed to families and groups. It is NOT reasonable to expect people to spend $300-400 on a second (and third, or fourth) console PLUS the additional costs of $90 per game just so everyone in a household can have the same experience.

You can’t even buy another copy of the game if you want your own island. No, that’d be too easy. Instead, Nintendo decided that each console is only allowed to have ONE island each.

I wont be buying a second game or a second switch just for that. This is 2020, multiple console saves ARE a thing.

EldLiger,26-03-2020,"Animal Crossing has always been a charming, simple game designed to be a relaxing sandbox. New Horizons definitely checks all those boxes, even if it does very little to actually improve on the game's age old formula.

One thing I see as a big step back (or at least a completely stagnant characteristic on par with harvest moon's stubborn refusal to include same-gender relationships while indie games like Stardew Valley do it so well) is the island sharing mechanic. I see a lot of people complaining that anyone who complains about this just wants to be ¨boosted¨, to stop whining and enjoy the game. The only logical reasoning is that those people are so entitled that they cannot imagine the game was not made for their sole enjoyment or so socially challenged that they cannot fathom how a family might want to share a console while still having a full gameplay experience for all players.

While I will not rant on and on about how this is completely unacceptable, it does show that the developers either can't design a game that allows for separate and independent save files (a worrying prospect) or did not imagine that some people might like having their own, separate sandbox experience without either having to limit their own or other people's experience in order to do so, after multiple installments of a very family-friendly game (families usually have more than one people in them, and many will have more than one member interested in the game), which is brings me to believe that while Animal Crossing will always be able to deliver in charm, it will never grow to be better than what it is and will always be.

This might be the last Animal Crossing game I will purchase, unless I see some effort on their part on actually creating an evolving experience with each game.

If you’ve come here looking at reviews to see if you want to buy the game I suggest ignoring the people giving it 0, they’re review bombing the game and using a feature that was multiple times said to not exist. All the marketing through directs as well as press said there would only be one island per console.

aka_Izzy,24-03-2020,"I'm a first-timer with Animal Crossing and I am pleasantly surprised. The world is so charming and the game is designed to be explored at your own pace. Don't let the ""cuteness"" fool you. Underneath the whimsical appearance lies a brilliantly designed game... that's a whole lotta fun.

I can tell that time and care went into this title. It's in the details. Just because things aren't exploding on screen, doesn't mean there's less going on. The fun I am having has to do with the freedom to really design my own little Oasis. I usually shy away from design-driven games like Minecraft because I get bored very quickly... this however feels very different. There are goals to achieve and rewards to receive. The game gradually teaches you it's mechanics in a way that doesn't make me fatigued or bored- there's always something just around the corner to perk your interest.

There are families that have shared consoles across their kids. So what, are they supposed to buy another two or three switches and games so that everyone can have their own island? Every other switch game can save on separate accounts for different people to play through, so I know that this wasn’t because they didn’t have the capability to allow people their own islands, it is 100% obvious it was a money grab opportunity for them. It’s really upsetting because it is a great game so far, it’s a shame that 2+ people can’t play it on their own accounts with their own islands. You had to take a bigger step from making people buy separate games to play different towns in New Leaf to making people buy their own switches plus another copy of New Horizons. Even a step further, you made it so that when someone else is playing on the creators island, they can do next to nothing to make their own kind of progress. I tried to put up with that form of multiplayer but it is extremely irritating and pointless to even play it at that point.

Jadedflames,24-03-2020,"I'd probably normally give it a 9, since I reserve 10s for games that land in my ""best ever"" list. But the review bombing here is insane.

This is the best Animal Crossing experience to be had, ever, in my opinion. The quality of life improvements are killer, the fact that you can change the entire island up are great (putting furniture outside? Say whaaaat? Why was this not the norm long ago?)

I have played with online friends for several hours over the last couple of days, there is very little lag, and we are all having a blast.

This doesn't really change much about the formula of animal crossing, and if you have been playing New Leaf for 7 years straight, you may prefer just staying in your old town. But if you want a definitive, next-gen animal crossing on console, this is the best (I mean, the only, but also the best) thing for it.

It's beautiful, adorable, and a better experience than any AC game that came before it. If you are an AC fan, go ahead and get it. if you're not an AC fan, this might change your mind.

If you only wanted to buy this game because of a certain type of multiplayer that you wish it had, but has never had, was never planned to have, and had never been described as having, then go get another game. But it's a great experience, and you will be missing out.

Anyone who is negative review bombing is ignoring all of the wonderful aspects of the game- and the fact that multiplayer in this game is much more inclusive and effective than AC games in the past. I mean in New Leaf, there was only one player who could be mayor (aka only one decision maker) and I didn't see nearly the same amount of outrage. The fact of the matter is the switch is a singer player device that offers multiplayer options, and they are not obligated to do anything. Additionally, people are not being patient enough to get through the introductory period in game, after you wait through the introductory period, all characters will eventually be able to add things outside and terraform. I absolutely despise how susceptible people are to outrage culture, and how impatient people are. If you aren't patient enough to play this game, then that's on you because the nature of AC is to make progress slowly. Sorry you all weren't instantly gratified.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

As an AC veteran, this game fulfilled my wishes from when I was a 5-yr old playing the gamecube version. The game gives you so many options to live your life on the island. You have just about total control over every single thing on the island.

What a lot of people love about the AC series is that THERE IS NO OBJECTIVE. You can do literally whatever you want. You have the OPTION to fill the museum, buy every single item, buy every single piece of clothing, and even refuse to pay off your loan from Tom Nook because we all know he's greedy. That is the beauty of this series. It's not meant to be played by the traditional gamer who expects the game to end. That's why so many people have been playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf since it's release date in 2013!

It's a relaxing game filled with so much more personality than New Leaf. Just yesterday, one of my villagers was singing by the lake for 20 minutes! You can see villagers sweeping, building - my poor Biff has yet to catch a bug and gets super sad about it.

CryingMachine,21-09-2021,"UPDATED REVIEW:
Animal Crossing WAS a great game, we were promised so much and the initial release was great since there was so much to explore and everything was new.
Sadly that initial state of the game stayed...even until today. AC:NH has not gotten any major update for a long long time. Even the major updates that happened last year wore off already.

Nintendo really promised us 3 (or so) years of updates, sadly what they meant is 3 years of the same god-damn events every time. Gets quite sickening.

The villagers are also getting tiring, same dialogue, same robotic interactions. Not fun anymore.

I've spent 100hrs in this game and that's it to be honest, the game is stale and not fun anymore.
Everything just feels really old and boring and there's nothing new to do.

This is part of a bigger problem of Nintendo, over the years they started slacking more and more. Yes they do release amazing games every now and then (Mario Odyssey and Breath of the Wild) but a lot of their releases feel very ""clean"" with no life in them.

OLD REVIEW 9/10 (Jun 28, 2020) :
This game is amazing.

Animal Crossing is a game in which you can just sit back and relax to. A perfect game to escape reality with. The control is in your hands as you land on a deserted island with nothing but tents, you can build a thriving community. I love it!

With each new day you get access to new components of the game, yeah some might call it an unnecessary hindrance but this allows for a fresh dose of content each new day. Animal Crossing isn't about completing EVERYTHING in a day or two. You really do have to invest a lot of time and the game rewards you for doing so. Yeah not for everyone but for those who love games such as Stardew Valley this game is perfect.

The villagers (or I suppose Islanders) are very charismatic and make the island that much more fun. Yeah not all of them are great but there are just so many villagers that you can easily pick out your favourites and invite them to your island.

I love this game, I really do but I am also not a fan of the idea of singular saves per console. It really annoys me, I personally don't share my switch with my family as they don't care for Nintendo games but this is really spoiling the fun for others, also there is currently no CLOUD SAVING even though Nintendo brags about having that option for the NSO Subscribers. I hope Nintendo gets a grip and address this issue in the next update(s). Other than that I honestly have not major complaints.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
cghaman,25-03-2020,"I preordered this for my girlfriend—along with waiting in line just to get the limited edition console—and was excited to share a game that I had unexpectedly fallen in love with back on the Gamecube. Boy, have things taken a turn for the worse. Only one island per CONSOLE? That, combined with playing the same awful 3 minute guitar strumming on an endless loop (a bug that Nintendo has not even acknowledged, let alone fixed)...those in isolation would have dropped this from a 10 to a 5. What drops this all the way to a 2 is the fact that I cannot do anything at ALL to advance the game when she isn't playing. Okay, so I can add to the museum...but I couldn't get the museum to exist, and I cannot get anything else to happen. I am beyond peeved, and Nintendo's silence in response to criticism is deafening. I am furious about this, and would return this game IMMEDIATELY were it not a gift. What on Earth happened to Nintendo?

carolynpal8,26-03-2020,"Me and my boyfriend got in this huge fight because we went out, bought the switch and New Horizons. Just to find out only one of us can play, TRULY PLAY. It’s so frustrating, the POPULATION ARE NOT IDIOTS. We understand that this is a PLOY TO GET US TO BUY MORE NINTENDO SWITCHES. You think that this will get you more revenue? No, in fact it will hurt your game because there won’t be as much users playing at the same time. Why does anyone want to share an Island together? The beauty of the game is being able to create whatever you want and express yourself. Also the fact that the game is in real run time ABSOLUTELY KILLS IT. Are you kidding me you’re going to make it only one island, expecting the players to share because up to 8 of them can live on the island? And incorporate the fact that it is a deserted island so there’s going to be nothing there, A LACK OF RESOURCES already? Honestly, made the decisions to change this, this is a family fun oriented game and what keeps it interesting is seeing the other peoples towns that’s what created spark. Nobody wants to play on the same town, there’s a lack of quests lack of everything. Your customers are even trying to get refunded their money because of this, it’s absolutely disgusting.


UPDATE

We tried playing the CO-OP on screen that they had an it was an ABSOLUTE FAILURE. They made one of us each be FOLLOWER AND LEADER. The FOLLOWER COULDN’T ACCESS INVENTORY, OR GO TO NOOKS & BUY STUFF IT WAS JUST THE TOOLS. SERIOUSLY NINTENDO! THE FOLLOWER COULDNT EVEN TALK TO THE RESIDENTS EITHER.

Sethht,26-03-2020,"This a great game if you live alone. If you have anyone else in your household, it’s going to suck. You can only have one island per Switch and only the first player has full access to the game. I played and exhausted all the resources and my partner logged in and was unable to do anything. I think it’s greedy for a company to take this approach considering some families only have one switch and perhaps multiple children or individuals who would like to play the game. The solution shouldn’t be for each member of the family to have to buy a separate Switch and Animal Crossing game. If this game were to be updated to include one island per account then I would change my rating to 5 stars. I really hope something is done about this soon.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

veox,27-03-2020,"The game is wonderfully simple and nuanced with plenty to do and discover. It gives players a reason to put down the game at times, but you keep coming back. There is plenty to discover and do, but gives the player the opportunity to choose the goals they want to accomplish for their play style. Unfortunately I got this game to play with my partner for 1 console co-op play. There really is no true way to play this way as was advertised. The second player is essentially an NPC. The UI and controls for single console multi-player are embarrassing for such a renowned title. I would give this game a 10 if they simply hadn't even included the feature at all; it's highly misleading. For it to work so well with online and multiple console multi-player, it seems like a regrettable attempt to force console purchasing. I would love input from the studio on why they failed to deliver a coherent single-console co-op. The UI and controls while in single console multi-player come across as if it was an afterthought It is both hard to use and cumbersome. The inventory or tool selection isn't even available for player 2. Is it really that hard to apply the same feature to all players? Seems like poor code architecture to me. Not to mention the second player can't participate in the game contents in any meaningful way. Player 2 gets a very lazy stream of ""check with player 1"" messages instead of having NPCs treat player 2 as a player rather than a tag along NPC. Overall, for my circumstances, this game has failed in the most important ways which is why I cannot recommend it for users like me.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
exycited,28-03-2020,"I bought this game, bc I thought it would be relaxing and fun. It probably is for the first player but not for the second player on the island.

My roommate started her playthrough first and I was excited to start mine too only to be extremely disappointed that I cannot make my own island and instead I have to be stuck on her island as a second player.
The fact that the second player cannot progress through the story like the first one makes it a sad experience - as a second player I am missing the story, some dialogue options and interactions as well as creative control over the island and so the reception of the game changes a lot for me. Also, it's not only the story, the mechanics change too - I cannot even get the axe recipe without spending the money. The first player gets it through interactions with Tom Nook. And while the cost might be similar in both cases, the experience is very different - i really dislike it.

The restriction of one island per switch is artificial and could easily be changed to one island per profile. I've already paid whole 60$ for this game - and because of the limit of one island per console it feels like the price is too high. Especially when we compare it to other Nintendo games at a similar price point like BOTW which can be played separately on different profiles.

Animal Crossing has a family-friendly rating and so you would think it would be a family-friendly game, but if you want to play with your spouse or have more than one child you would have to buy a whole new Switch for both people to enjoy the game on their own instead of having to share an island because of some artificial restrictions.
Also the fact that this cannot be remedied by buying a second game cartridge and only by buying a second Switch makes it feel like a cash grab on the side of Nintendo. I understand that the saves are stored on the console not the cartridge, but I am sure this could have been remedied in some way.

I had very high expectations of this game and was looking forward to spending time on my island paradise with cute animal friends, but instead I feel like an NPC in my own game and I have to fight over resources with my friend...
I wish I could give this game a higher score, bc it really is cute and sweet, but I don't feel like I can do that in this situation - thus the low score.

My wife plays but not as much as I do, had I know. i’d be limited I would have set my character up first. Regardless she’s annoyed that we both have to start over again after several hours of gameplay and after restarting she has no interest in the game and we’re both extremely annoyed that we can’t build an island together. Rather its one player building it and another person is just along for the ride.

Pretty lame, after all of this starting over multiple times its getting difficult to find enjoyment in the game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC
Pckljoos,30-03-2020,My personal experience of this game was very disappointing. I share a switch my boyfriend and he already started his island a few days before I was able to begin. I am not able to create my own island and I have to live on his. We had completely different experiences of the game right away because he’s in charge of the island and gets to decide everything. I was really looking forward to making my own island but now I’m not even sure if I want to play. I don’t want to be forced to buying a whole new console and game just so I can have the same game play experience as someone else in my Jimenez. Bad design.,0,ACNH,METACRITIC

FixAnimalCross,24-03-2020,"I’m changing my review to a flat 5. I feel a complete zero was unfair. To be fair I was angry and I still think rightfully so. However, the multiplayer issues aside this game brings back memories of playing on the GC when I was a kid. I think it’s by far the best installment since then. I’ve spent hours playing and it’s very relaxing, yet addictive. I hope they can patch the multiplayer issues though. We ended up restarting so my fiancée could have lead since she plays more. We lost all of our progress which was frustrating, but obviously we kept playing so they must have done something right. This game is bad for player 2.Animal crossing on the GC allowed for all for players to have the same power. In this one only the first islander can progress the island?? Are you kidding me?? How hard would it have been to at least allow the other players to donate items to Nook for the store?? Or let them put items in the construction boxes?? This game isn’t family friendly at all. This game turned out to be a rip off marketing scheme to get entire families to buy the game and switches just so they could progress their islands.

As the second player, she cannot progress the tutorial. She cannot make any decisions that shape the island. This is a half-baked experience for anybody other than the first player on the island. If your Resident Representative isn't as active as you, or even decides to stop playing the game, good luck! You'll never, ever progress past wherever they left off.

Good job nintendo, you really got those evil time travelers that were SERIOUSLY cutting into your bank- oh wait, time traveling affects no one but the player who might otherwise not be able to play due to travel/work/school.
Game feels unfinished, hundreds of items cut, many characters cut (so no point to the amiibo features to get your fave villagers unless you're lucky), swimming/gyroids/paintings/99% of special npcs cut, everywhere you look theres cut content that we get to hopefully wait for nintendo to drip feed us while a chorus of people repeat that ""HEY.

MAYBE you should just stop complaining since now theres SO many new things like...oh wait, the furniture placement stuff is from hhd, and crafting furniture from harvested material to place outside is from pocket camp so. nothing new except this stick i can use to cross rivers i guess.""

This is quite possibly the worst multiplayer videogame in existence. What's that, son? You want to play by yourself? Don't have too much fun now, because you will ruin the game for everyone else, leaving them with nothing to do and an empty shell of an experience. Oh yeah, also you don't get to play any further in the game until your mom logs in to advance the game, has one brief moment of enjoyment, and then you proceed to ruin the game all over again. It's not his fault that he wants to play a game to have fun. It's Nintendo's.

The lack of multiple save files and a separate multiplayer mode is one of the worst decisions I've ever seen, and I believe they didn't even playtest it.

thevaulthunter,24-03-2020,"In relevance to all these 0s:
You could ALWAYS only have 1 town. This has been a thing in every multiplayer installment of Animal Crossing. Every single one. The point is to have multiple people COOPERATE on one island rather than compete. In any case, that is ONE facet of this game. That is one little thing. A majority of the gameplay is solo. If you went into this expecting something different, that's not at the fault of the game at all.

The fact that many cite the multiplayer as what makes this game a 0 out of 10 speaks LEVELS to how amazing it is. Imagine for example if someone hated how boring a game like Mario Maker is if you didn't have internet. That's what these complaints amount to.

Almost every system has been streamlined and made easier or expanded upon with the exception of one: Tools. Furniture can be obtained in many ways, now randomly dropping from balloons (rather than just specific items), being able to be crafted, being able to be bought with both bells and nook miles, given away by villagers, found in trees, gifted by special characters, and of course from friends. On top of this, an improved customization system allows for you to change the appearance of many items on the fly, and for those that allow custom designs, that system has been expanded in all senses of the word: pixel art is now smoothed out, making it less immersion breaking. You can store a myriad of designs rather than 16. You have absolute control over the palette you color with instead of presets.

Placing furniture is also a lot easier. Taking ideas from Pocket Camp and Happy Home Designer, furniture can be manipulated on a much smaller set of tiles than in previous games. A ""1 tile wide"" object can be placed on half tiles, for example. An overhead view can be utilized in homemaking to manipulate many objects at a time. Wall items can be placed anywhere on the wall, even vertically above each other. Light objects are now dynamic, allowing you to really set the mood of your home beyond just their color.

Furniture can of course, now be placed outside, meaning you have control over your entire town instead of simply your house and a small handful of monuments. This opens up the floodgates for a truly custom experience, and in a few weeks time, I am excited to visit the towns of strangers to see the creations they built.

Villagers have a lot more personality now. Each one will interact with the world around them and have their own tastes in furniture and clothing. While before, their personality amounted simply to what bit of dialog they spat out when greeting you at best (Sporty villager always talks about sports), this has been expanded into them actually having a preference for what furniture they want on the island, what things they want you to craft, what they give you. I had a villager give me a hat once and I wore it. In previous games, that would be the end of that exchange, but in New Horizons, later talking to the villager, he had thanked me for actually wearing his gift from days prior. They acknowledge what objects are made for now, you'll have them say ""I exercise with this kettle bell!"" or ""This wooden double bed is so comfortable to sleep in!"" rather than ""This is my favorite [insert furniture name here]"" over and over. You will find NPCs sleeping under trees, or reading a book with their glasses on, or dusting their home. It feels more alive.

Now, for the flaws. Kind of. New Horizons puts you in the role of a resident who just moved onto a deserted island, and you have to build up from there. Now, this is a very interesting experience starting out, and I actually love the idea of it. You gather materials to build your tools to build better things and unlock more decor or better tools, a la many survival games. The issue with it however is the late game. When you get to the end of Minecraft, Terraria, Ark, what have you, you have the best tools that almost never break. There are no equivalents thus far, the best tools are twice as good as the base tools, which isn't fantastic.

The next issue is 1 island, which while minor, is still an issue as with all the creative opportunity, you have but one canvas to work on. If you want two distinctly themed islands, you have to remove the first to do that, and it's a little heartbreaking.

Other than those two things however, the game improves on everything Animal Crossing, and I would recommend it to all Switch owners, and say it's a NECESSITY for any Animal Crossing player.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Robo72,24-03-2020,"I’ve always been a huge animal crossing fan as well as my mum, playing since Wild World. I have been so excited for this game for so long, which couldn’t have come at a better time btw. The game is visually amazing and there is so much more flexibility, more challenges and more to do. Placing items inside and outside, the crafting and customisation mechanic, choosing where villagers live, terraforming and waterscaping which are available later on are all unimaginably amazing features and really let you customise your island. Being able to play with 7 other friends is amazing, I have made huge use of this feature, having a large amount of friends who also play the game and this has enabled me to feel less isolated as well. I don’t understand why people complain about only being able to have one island, me and my mum have always had 2 characters on the same town and absolutely love it. We can customise ourselves and homes individually as well as sharing many experiences, such as working together to complete the museum donations etc and doing things for each other when the other is absent. The amazing thing now is that 2 people can play on one system at the same time, which is something we could never do before and I have absolutely loved doing this! People who say for 2 people in the same house to play together you need 2 switches, that’s simply not true at all. In the past this was true as you could only play one at a time and would need 2 3ds and local play, but now this is not needed as you can much more easily enjoy playing together as well as apart. People who leave 0/10 reviews obviously have no clue what they are talking about and can’t appreciate how great this game is and how many amazing editions have been made -crafting, customisation in seconds, placing everything where you want, changing your whole island layout, being able to pick up entire trees and move them, being able to expand your inventory, new hairstyles and facial features that you can change when you want much more flexible pro designs- can now make hoodies and different types of dresses etc and more!!

2. Animal Crossing has always been one town per memory card/console. It's been like this from the first iteration of the dang game on GameCub. You had to buy a second memory card to have a second town.

3. There was SO MUCH MEDIA surrounding this game that warned y'all you couldn't have a second island. It was quite literally everywhere. It shouldn't have been a surprise to you, and if it was, maybe you should research games before you buy them?",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
blackholebomb,24-03-2020,"So this game is better than any Animal Crossing game before it, it adds a ton of new features and adds to the flavor of the world of Animal Crossing, helping you become more invested in your game over all.

However there have been a number of complains about the ""one island per console"". This has always been the case for Animal Crossing, that anyone playing on the same console and/or cart would share the world with their other family members. GameCube is the exception because it had memory cards. Just like before, if everyone wants their own isolated experience, then you need to have your own system. That's what the Switch Lite is for, it's meant to be the 3DS/DS/GBA to the Wii U/Wii/GC of its generation, except we get to play all the same games now. So like before, get your own system and copy of the game, business as usual. You probably were a single console multiple handheld family before, so be a multiple Switch family.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Teacol,24-03-2020,"I'll admit, I'm not the best person to ask for a review of this game, but that's only because I haven't gotten to play this game because of Nintendo forcing players to only have one island per console.

For some quick context, my twin brother bought this game for our birthday and began playing immediately at launch. I watched him play here and there and became interested seeing as neither he or I had ever played an Animal Crossing game before but we both had only heard good things about the series. I decided to let my brother play for a few days on his own before starting up my own save. When I did, I gathered my parents and had them watch me as I figured they too would probably enjoy the game and I wanted to introduce it to them with me so we could have a new bonding experience. To my dismay however, I was able to create my own villager, but not my own island.

My brother has done nothing but tell me how much fun the game is, with my friends and the Internet echoing his praises. And yet unless I decide to fork over an extra $360 to purchase a new switch and copy of the game, I will be locked out of this game's full experience.

While this may seem like a bold claim to some, when you have a game centered around a small island, and then make players share that one island per console, you are essentially making them share a save file. Maybe I wouldn't be so upset about this fact if it wasn't common for every other game on the switch to allow multiple save files per console account.

I have heard the argument that this has always been a feature in the animal crossing series, to which I say, look at Pokemon. When Pokemon transitioned to the switch, they dropped having only one save per device, and people are now able to experience the newest Pokemon games with multiple saves. I don't see any logical reason why Animal Crossing is unable to make the same transition.

I'd also like to bring up the argument of target demographics. While it is true that the Animal Crossing series has always been able to connect with a wide audience and demographic, which is what makes the series so great I'm told, I still imagine that the target audience of this game series is children, seeing as the game contains a cute cartoony art style and is rated E for Everyone by the ESRB, allowing children to also experience the game. I can't imagine the arguments going on in households that contain multiple children right now over who gets to play on the island and who gets to do what on the island.

The bottom line here is that Nintendo is shooting themselves in the foot by not including multiple islands as this both angers old fans and limits the amount of new players able to experience the game. The hardware is clearly there, seeing as every other game on the Switch allows multiple saves across Switch accounts, including old games that didn't before moving to the Switch like Pokemon.

At the beginning of this review I said I'm not the best reviewer of this game seeing as I've been unable to play it. But for that reason alone, I'm rating this game 1 out of 10. I can see no logic in this choice of only allowing one island per console. I was really excited to try this series out for the first time, only to have that excitement squashed due to Nintendo limiting it's player base for this new game. I don't doubt the game is good, I just wish I could play it along with everyone else.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC
Missjessicasage,25-03-2020,"Only ONE island per switch? Are you guys crazy? Already having a hard enough time finding room for new villagers.

And then my brother wants to play. I'd love for him to. Well, can't bc I've set my whole island. Also crappy that another player can come in and just put their house wherever, with the option of deleting whatever is in that area. Also a dumb choice with the nook mile quests. Chip down a tree. Plant a tree. Plant flowers. Etc. I want my island to be my own. At least in previous games you had the choice of swapping memory cards or cartridges.

MasterCheff4,25-03-2020,"I actually just made a metacritic account just to review this game. This would be an almost perfect game if it wasn't for the one island per switch feature mixed with the first player to log in be in control of the entire game's progression for all players. This is an increasing issue if you actually have 8 players on the same switch.

Each of the 8 players should have the ability to create their own island and be the representative of that island, controlling all progression of that island. Additionally, players on the same switch should be able to buy houses on other players islands on the same switch. This would allow a player to have full control over one island and it's progression, and then also have up to 7 additional houses across 7 other islands on that switch console.

I enjoy playing on the shared island, but the locked island progression and missing out on that progression is killer to this game. The current system lets player 1 get the full game, with all other players only objective is to complete nook miles.

Worst part is there was not even a warning at the beginning of the game letting the players know that the first person to play gets full control. I think that is the most disappointing aspect of this situation.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

MisterMajestic,28-03-2020,"I haven’t played an Animal Crossing game in the past, but with the self-quarantine going on I figured buying this game to enjoy with my siblings would be a great way to pass the time. We planned on playing on our own worlds and had heard that there was a way to visit each other’s local islands. However, we were met with a restriction on our fun that drastically contrasts a game in this style. There is only ONE island per CONSOLE. Yes, that’s right, you can only make ONE island on each Nintendo Switch. It doesn’t matter if you switch accounts. The higher ups over at Nintendo have decided that with this $60 purchase you are granted ONE little island. But that’s not even the best part! You see, you can in fact join islands locally! Huzzah! But... you can’t progress, you can’t check your inventory, you can’t even walk too far away from the person who made the island. Thanks Nintendo! And so, that leaves my siblings and I in the queue for a refund, and a feeling of disappointment. Surely that can’t be what the developers had wanted right? Well, that’s what they created. This limitation can be interpreted in one of two ways: At worst, a greed-fueled effort led by Nintendo corporate executives to get consumers to buy more than one Switch, so that you can have more than one island, or at best, a way to bring players together locally so that they can learn what a leader and a follower is, and where player 2 fits into that equation.

The second player has an overall worse experience with many features locked out from them, and unlike previous games this is not solved by simply buying a new memory card or a second game cart. This is not consumer friendly and forces players in the same household to buy multiple Switches if they want the full experience. At least in New Leaf you can transfer your house as the second player if you wanted to be the mayor of your own town, such a feature is not possible here.

solidzone,24-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game. Honestly, it's very good so far.

However, I'm giving this game a bad score because of the mangled couch co-op / multiple profile experience. The first profile to start the game becomes the Resident Representative. This is the only player who is able to further progress the story / quests. The second player is merely a glorified island resident. Why did Nintendo decide to not let me, the second player, place homes, help with tasks or even get the same recipes as the first player?

Here's a list of what I'm not able to do:
- I do not get the same DIY recipes (this includes things like the axe, shovel, etc. Essential tools!)
- I am not asked to help upgrade the island
- I am not invited to participate in new projects
- I cannot help my girlfriend with her own island projects
- I am not even allowed to check in-progress projects to see what resources are needed.

Tom Nook literally tells me to ask my girlfriend what she needs.

The multiple profile experience has been absolutely horrid so far and managed to seriously impact how my girlfriend and I play this game together. We were very excited about this game and were ultimately let down. Thanks, Nintendo.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC

And what's with the mexican stuff in this game? This is supposed to be a game for the AC fans, not SJWs, it just makes no sense why they would include that trash in an AC game.

- get new DIY recipes for welcoming new villagers;
- help upgrade the island;
- participate in new projects.

Understandably, everybody but the first player is losing interest. All they can do is mine resources, after all.. Can this be fixed? I would love for other players to:

However, I own two Nintendo Switches (OG and Lite) bought the game hoping for cloud saves, no dice. So I set up on the family OG switch, not knowing you may only have ONE ISLAND per console. This has locked my wife and son out of the game for pacing and my son who typically wakes up early to play consumes all the island resources. Ultimately I could just restart on the lite but that would lock me out of the TV side which I enjoy. So the solution would not be to buy another copy of the game it would be to buy a another full switch console. This makes my rating of the game go from a 9-10 to a 2.

Ridiculous. If you are the secondary player you still get like 90% of the experience and you are supposed to talk with your family and organize yourselves to make the important choices and share the resources, how is this so hard?

Yes but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable than any of the other games I've played in the series. I have read all other people's reviews and the people giving it a bad review either new absolutely nothing about the series or did absolutely zero research before purchasing the game. I would give this game a solid 10/10 but I have to give it a 9 just because the game seems to start out more slowly than any of the others in the series and parts of the game feel a little more like work and more tedious than previous games.

Cons:
The RNG could probably be more balanced? Some of the UI could have been more streamlined. I see why people are upset about the lack of content for a second islander, but to me, it feels the same as how New Leaf operated, one character making all the decisions while the others build up their own stuff.

Mind you this isn't real time, as it will unlock at 5am tomorrow regardless of when you hit the gate. This makes certain buildings a chore, most notably the museum. You get gated after 5 donations to Tom then after 15 more donations to Blathers, which is then followed by a mandatory 24h construction period. This process takes 48 to 72 hours depending on when you made the first 5 donations, which feels annoying because you need to hold onto any discoveries you find for that time.

Next is progression, which for the most part punishes you for doing so. A good example of this is buying from Timmy & Tommy. At the start of the game you can buy & sell from them freely until you get Nook's Cranny. When you do you can only buy & sell normally until 10pm, you can sell using the box at any time with it only being 80% of normal selling price. This detail annoys me so much. If the shop hours was going to be a thing, why not have it always be like that? That way it doesn't feel like they are restricting features or selling for less because you are past the time-frame. The box could have been a positive feature by letting you sell past close time, but instead it's just presented in a way that punishes the player.

The tool system isn't much different. Tools break and there are stronger versions available for the right material, but they never change the act of collecting and can actually be a downgrade if the player isn't careful. This can be seen with the iron axe, which doesn't increase the amount of wood dropped and instead will chop down a tree on the 3rd hit, preventing it from growing again and stopping you from collecting wood. There is no reason to use the iron axe over the stone one, which offers the same amount of drops without destroying the source and still offers a fair amount of hits. If you do want to move a tree, just use shovel + fruit which actually put it into your inventory to move/sell.

There are other odd details that haven't impacted me much as a solo player being the only one on my switch, but having a single island per console is really not fun since if you want to try local multiplayer you need to place additional tents down on your island to do so. Multiplayer isn't that well explained by the game in general. Overall I do like the game, but the design clashes a lot with the zen game it's trying to be.

Bunny Day Update: Oh boy I do like being able to progress even less because of eggs appearing instead of needed materials. This game already has too much rng.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
LeGame,01-04-2020,"Absolute turd game design. Why does only the first player get the full game experience? I don't mind 1 island per console, every Animal Crossing has done that.

Though I am honestly really glad that I can share the island with my siblings, but that being said, it should be completely optional whether you want to share the island or not. Finally, I don't really get why everyone are assuming Nintendo's intentions behind this decision; this was a thing for as long as I remember in the Wii days (Probably even GameCube?) to share the island/neighborhood with local users, and obviously Nintendo's intentions weren't for you to go buy another Wii; it was purely a game design decision that has nothing to do with forcing people to buy another console, and no one really complained about this in the past as much as now and that's why they never considered adding the ""feature"" of having multiple islands per console since they assumed that what's not broken doesn't need fixing.

Kickingtheplace,26-08-2020,"Update Review:
After buying this same since launch, I honestly thought the newest Animal Crossing game would be better than it's predecessors. However, New Horizons fails to impress after completing the various set of objectives. The updates may have addressed the issues we wanted but the one Island system still exists while we rarely see new things being added. These updates only added special temporary events which did not give me an incentive to go back. Unfortunately, this game is lacking variety compared to New Leaf and City Folk. I feel like this game isn't living up to the hype especially to people who have devoted their lives to the franchise.

There was a real turning point while I was chopping my 20th tree that day; my axe broke and I saw that the requirements to make another axe meant I had to use the very wood I was collecting to make fun things.

MichaelJS,25-03-2020,"When I first heard about the Animal Crossing series, I had seen tid bits from some youtubers and talks about New Leaf and Pocket Camp. I got Pocket Camp on IOS and played it for a maximum of 20 minutes. It was simple and bland and turned me off the series while i still respected it. I thought it just wasn’t for me. Boy was I wrong (And i should’ve assumed that the mainline games were much better than the free mobile game). When Animal Crossing New Horizons was revealed, i thought it looked charming and was interested in giving it a go and i’m so glad i did. So far this game has been a magical experience. Watching the deserted island grow into a thriving society is very satisfying. Gameplay is so calming but also engaging. The game starts slow and progresses while you complete tasks, fish, catch bugs, pick weeds, and build houses for upcoming residents. If i could say one thing to new players: It’s ok if you feel like you’ve done everything you need to for the day and feel like you should put the game down. This game is all about patience which can sometimes be frustrating but also very rewarding. Some days, once you’ve done your daily tasks like gather materials and talking to the villagers, there’s not much else to do and you have to wait until the next day where more stuff will be available. This game is designed to be played over several months and years so don’t rush it and take your time, building your town and getting everything the way you want it. This game is absolutely visually stunning Running at a gorgeous 1080p 30fps. That 30fps might seem like a bit of a bummer, but rest assured it stays at 30fps and never dips and still looks very smooth. The best thing about this game is it’s charm. Talking to each character is such an enjoyable experience. Multi playing with friends is smooth with no lag and a good way to trade items. This game is very addicting and you’ll most likely find yourself spending hours into the night. Keep in mind that the game will keep posing new quests and challenges weeks down the line. But a lot of this game is customisation and making your town look the way you want. I love this game so much, and if you are in the slightest bit interested, give it a try. I didn’t think this sort of game was for me either, but that is because it’s not enjoyable to watch someone else play the game but having your own journey is where the charm lies.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Nippi,09-04-2020,"Low rating this game I am actually thoroughly enjoying because once again, Nintendo is becoming increasingly greedy. I was upset when they flushed free Online play down the toilet even though they clearly can afford to leave it free. Now I'm hearing how Nintendo is ripping off its consumers with the new Animal Crossing game by basically eliminating any multiplayer functionality and essential forcing households with more than one player to buy a second Switch to enjoy all of the features of the game. I have fond memories 12 years ago of me, my sister, and even my mom (who pretty much never plays video games) playing the previous console based game, City Folk. I grieve for kids who are the age I was at this time who will not have those same memories of their entire family enjoying the game. Nintendo is becoming increasingly less family friendly and more greedy. Shame, Nintendo. Absolute shame. One of these days, Nintendo's greed will cost it it's fanbase: and that will be an unfortunate day if they do not improve their relationship with their consumers.

The community at large is pretty sweet, so my online multiplayer experience has been pretty good so far, but it seems that you shouldn't share accounts on a same switch, which is definitely a glaring weakness.

Немного кривой мультиплеер (в плане удобства). В принципе из недостатков лично для меня ничего не выявил. Я получил то, что хотел. Не понимаю, почему из за отсутствия возможности создания второго острова полетело столько негативных отзывов.

The game is really good but not worth spending 200-300 more dollars just to be able to have 2 people play with FULL ACCESS. Many people already know that the first account on the switch to start the game is the ""Resident Representative"" of the Island and they are the only person who can advance the story, buildings, and citizens of the town. Any player/account who starts the game of the switch after that first player can only gather resources and upgrade there own house and characters appearance and size and can only get blueprints and items that the FIRST PLAYER has unlocked first.

The characters are as lovable as in Population Growing again, and the world is as huge as well. Building the world how you want from New Leaf is completely ramped up, and the world is more full of fish and bugs than ever. Crafting completely changes the game, allowing the player to enjoy the game at night or early morning, even though shops are closed. This is truly a triumphant return for Animal Crossing, and the game will be even better when the dlc arrives. If you enjoyed any Animal Crossing game, you'll love this one, and if you've never given Animal Crossing a shot, now's certainly the time.

ZWiz25,24-03-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons, is by far the best game in the series. The game starts off differently from every other animal crossing.You start in a barren island with 2 other villagers and a very bare bones shop. You also can’t reach the majority of the island yet. As you progress you gain new tools that help collect bugs, fish, and building supplies. You’ll eventually see more shops move in as you also gain new tools like the pole vault and ladder to explore the rest of the island. It’s extremely fun to see the island develop into a full on town. While the game does take days to get new things, you can easily skip that process by using time travel (I personally don’t). My main complaint is the multiplayer. For at least where I am now, there’s not much to do besides visit your friends island and not much more.

It's just as relaxing as all of the previous games and it adds so much more to do. I also enjoyed inviting a close friend of mine to visit my island. It was very easy to do and we both enjoyed our time. I would say the crappy part about it was having to type to each other to communicate. That was a pain to do but nevertheless we still enjoyed visiting each other. I have yet to try to play with family (We do have two switch systems, however, my son is too young to know how to play and my husband cares more for Smash bros than anything else lol), however, despite it not personally affecting me there should have still been a much better way this could have been implemented for those it does have an effect on. It's not fair that they have to go through so much (even as far as buying another system) just to play with one another when they shouldn't have to. If I remember correctly, in the first animal crossing game you could all live in the same location, so why make it different now? I will however still be fair with my rating.

Bogavante,24-03-2020,Animal Crossing New Horizons is a refreshing entry in the series by combining the best aspects of previous games and polishing them. As a whole New Horizons most resembles the GameCube entry from the early 2000s. With this resemblence comes a few features being cut but in exchange many have been added mostly in the way of customization from the freedom to place whatever you want on the island to the ability to change your characters physical appearance when a mirror is present. Overall NH is a fantastic entry.,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
dpkramer,24-03-2020,"The one island thing is indefensible, even if they told us up front. How many families have more than one child that would want to run their own island without their siblings interfering?

But that isn't why I gave this a zero. The big reason to me is the absolutely clunky and slow menu controls, and constant poor decisions that smack you in the face every time you're trying to enjoy the game.

I get that it's supposed to be ""slow"" and ""charming"", but I think AC fans are too quick to defend the game's charm that they think any criticism on the game is unfounded. If AC fans actually told the devs things that were not great, the series might have progressed since it was created.

This series was created on the GC when a lot of devs were still figuring out the do's and dont's of game development. Things like ""If you're going to make a game about crafting and customization, DON'T make the menu interface INSANELY SLOW, DON'T preface that menu with SLOW, crawling text that asks if you want to craft, DON'T only let us craft one item at a time, then DON'T make a five second craft and ""tadaa!"" animation that can be sped up by like, 5%, by jamming on the buttons, and then DON'T make us have to answer a slow, crawling question about going back into the menu, and doing it all over again. If I want to make a couple darkwood chairs, I have to slowly make each of them one at a (slow) time, then exit that menu and slowly enter the customization menu, and proceed to slowly customize them all, also one at a time.

If I want to figure out how much items sell for, I have to SLOWLY sell each different item alone, because there is no other way to know (also, you have to deal with slow crawling intro text, and you get booted out of the whole thing to start over each time). You know what they could have done? 1) Made it quicker. 2) Made the shops show the sell price as you hover over them, 3) add the pricing somewhere in all that empty space on the critterpedia entries. So many options to have not done it it annoyingly, but they figured out how to avoid all of them.

Don't tell me this is the ""charm"" of the game. The speed was charming back when there was barely anything to do in the game. For some asinine reason, they thought that clunky charm is equal no matter how it's utilized. But in a game that is now all about crafting and customizing at a scale it's never done before, SOMEONE on their team should have said ""uhh, this actually really sucks when all you're trying to do is build and customize a couple chairs and a table. Maybe we should change the crafting menu, at least."" I'm hoping that at some point, the shop ""evolves"" and they're like ""haha, look at all these new features! Aren't you happy that it isn't so annoying anymore?"", but even if they did that, I'd still be upset that they chose to screw with us instead of just MAKING IT GOOD.

It sucks, because the large majority of the game is good - but it's like someone gave you a delicious ice cream, but then slapped you in the back of your head every time you try to enjoy it.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Don't get hung up on how other people are playing it. Just sit down, play it, do whatever you want and is possible. You want to turn it into work by working away at paying those house loans off?

The opening is a bit slow but the pacing picks up steadily. My roommates and I have been loving this game! It's worth noting we're all adults with our own consoles though. To new time player's wondering if this game is for them: my best advice is check out some gameplay video on YouTube, what you see is what you get. Put succinctly Animal Crossing is a charming city simulation game, it doesn't have a grand narrative. Lastly, I don't understand why people are tearing down New Horizons for the island limit, Animal Crossing has always had this limit. It's not surprising. The appeal of multiplayer has always been playing together across multiple consoles, each player with their own screen and full range of controls, Nintendo released the Switch Lite in anticipation of this. The Switch is meant to be the successor of Nintendo's home and handheld consoles, it has the assets of both, tv play and on-the-go functionality. Animal Crossing New Horizons doesn't need to be docked to get the most out of the game, a Switch Lite is perfect for people who want to play this game without committing to a full ticket Switch.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Schuetzenhaus,25-03-2020,"So my wife never played Animal Crossing, I haven't played since the Gamecube version, I thought this would be great to play together.

Iearn that we both have to be on the same island despite having different accounts. I'm a little disappointed since we can't work on our own thing, but okay at least we'll be able to work together cooperatively right?

No. As the second player, I can't help contribute to quests. I couldn't help get bugs/fish to Nook, I couldn't help get materials to help build the shop, I can't help set up the new houses, I can't help build bridges, I can't help contribute anything to the game's story. I'm basically locked in progression behind her; I had to wait for her to get the axe before I could. I have to wait until she's able to build the shop until I can use it. Some of the little activities you can do for points are locked by story progression, so I'm stuck doing the same things over and over with no variety until she progresses the game. And that's so unbelievably frustrating to me since we can't have our own islands. I'm not even talking about simultaneous co-op. This is me playing as a second account.

What is even the reason behind limiting the second player? This does nothing but break the experience for me, and now my wife feels bad. It's a terrible design decision and I really hope it gets reversed at some point because it's absolute nonsense. There's absolutely no reason why a second profile shouldn't be able to get the same experience as the first. Either give me the little brother mode with limitations but offer me the option to work on my own island with full control, or if there's only 1 island let me help work on our island together without these dumb limitations.

First resident is the only island member that can contribute to projects and design the island how they want. Every secondary character is basically submitted to being a resource slave for the first player. The game only allows one island per switch so the resources you gather daily can only be harvested by a single user each day. This severely limits the whole crafting gimmick of this game.

Ok. The game seems fine. But if you are a family, several kids, multiple accounts on ONE switch. JUST DONT BUY IT. Every player but the main player is stuck after 30 minutes. You can't get the ability to create the basic axe. Why ?

1st of all, you can only create one island on one switch. Ok, why not ,the most active one should be the mayor. It's so sad but let day they have a reason for this (actually this is just a stupid restriction)
Then you realize you can't create a basic tool because the menu to do it (a dialog with Tom nook) just doesn't exist for non-main players..... Whaaaat ?
Ok, you think ""ok the main player has to unlock this so others can use it."" . Ahah. NO! You CANT.

Either it's a bug (so basic ?) Either it's a ""feature"", a deliberate choice. Then the game is unusable and the marketing strategy is "" like this game ? Buy each kid a switch, each kid a game and shut up"". Errrrrrr
Amazing.
Don't buy it. Or prepare for a fight at home.

Oh ,I almost forgot. The local multiplayer mode: useless, the 2nd player is just a pet following the other, farming for him, more slowly (stupid animation each time you pick up a piece of wood...). No split screen, no interest at all.

I'll wait a bit to see if a patch comes out soon. Or then I'll throw this piece of nook away.
'hope it helps

UPDATE : it seems after 2 or 3 specific actions from the main player, a new key character comes in and all players can finally get all the tools and trigger key improvements even if they're not the main player.

rookfire,29-03-2020,"The good is as most people say: the graphics and audio are amazing, some things are more convenient. I agree with all of it so I'm just going to focus on the bad.

The bad:
- There is WAY too little content for a $70 game. Half of the characters seem to have been axed (Brewster, Katrina, the dream suite, Leif, Gracie, the aplacas...). I kept thinking, 'Is this it? Is this all there is to the game?' when I realized that the last character to unlock was KK Slider.
- Needing the Nintendo Switch Online paid subscription to: 1) online play, 2) use QR codes. This is just really unfair.
- The increased number of tools. There are way too many tools. I'm of the opinion that a good game has one or two key dynamics and builds around that. But there are so many tools in ACNH that it becomes cumbersome when playing.
- DIY CRAFTING OF TOOLS. I effing hate this. Every tool breaks, even golden tools. Then what is the benefit of getting a golden tool? In ACNL, each tool upgrade gave a benefit that made sense in the game. The gold bug net has an increased radius so you can catch rare bugs that startle when you get too close, the golden watering can waters more flowers... There isn't even a way to tell if the tool is close to breaking.
- The constant grinding for materials. Because tools break, half my playtime is spent gathering materials. This has a few problems: 1) distracts from gameplay, 2) materials are almost as important as bells coz you need them to craft a variety of things, 3) at least 5-6 spaces in my inventory are wasted on holding materials, negating the increased inventory size
- The mileage programme. Like above, it distracts from the game coz in essence you have a bunch of meaningless and repetitive side-quests to do just so you can grind for quite a meager amount of miles (e.g. selling 10 seashells for about 200 miles). Also hate that the island ticket is paid for by mileage
- I really hate the new island mechanic. There are no tours, which makes it boring. When there is multiplayer, there's nothing to do. The islands also no longer reliably spawn sharks and rare bugs.
- Very difficult to grind for bells now. In New Leaf, a reliable way of getting money was through the money rock/the ore rock and the island, or the Bell Boom town ordinance (where are the ordinances, by the way?). The money rock gives less money now, there is no ore rock, the island no longer spawns rare stuff. Most items also have inflated prices. Flower seeds used to be 80 bells, now it's 240 bells.
- Paying bells to send letters. Seriously? Why on earth did someone think this was a good idea? Animal Crossing is about a sense of community that you create in the new island/town you move to. The letter system really gave a sense that you were writing to your villagers and they'd write back and send presents. Also, the villagers don't write back.
- THE VILLAGERS. They have way blander personalities. They no longer ask you to change their catchphrase, ask you to run silly errands and run up to you and pester you for something in your inventory. Their dialogue options are incredibly repetitive, where each villager seems to repeat the same 2-3 lines. Even the cute little animations are very repetitive.
- Having only 1 island per console. The local co-op system also is **** [link omitted per rules]
- Why isn't there an icon on my map for other players who are here?
- The merchants. Why is Kicks a wandering merchant instead of having an unlockable shop? Why is the furniture selection at T&T so small, and why can it only be upgraded once? Why isn't there the option to VIEW the wallpaper and flooring I want to buy, in the shop itself, before I buy it?
- Only being able to order 5 things from the catalogue. Why the ****

TLDR: the game is very beautiful and instagrammable, with some convenient upgrades, but it is mainly incredibly lacking in content, it is repetitive and restrictive, resulting in quite a frustrating gameplay experience. I am still playing because I love decorating and customizing, but it is incredibly unsatisfying.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

I could deal with that- we could have fun organizing an island together- but I can't progress the game or make any decisions about building on the island. It defeats the purpose of why I wanted the game to begin with. I'd even consider buying another copy of the game if I could get my own island, but that's not an option either.

You might be confused by the 0 rating I am giving this, but it is only for one simple reason, which is that you are limited to one island per device. It’s actually ridiculous that any account added after the original one is forced to be on the same island and follow behind the first player in the story. I mean, how difficult is it to just make separate saves for different accounts? I don’t want to have to miss out on the entirety of the main story having to follow behind the main player. Now each player has to compete for resources, land area, everything. The multiplayer option is god awful as well. One player, being the ‘leader’ can play the game normally while the other player is completely helpless. Having a simple fix of a split screen option would fix this so easily. Like please Nintendo, it really doesn’t seem like that hard of an update to fix the atrocious single island and multiplayer design you came up with. I mean whose idea was this anyway? It’s simply the worst multi player system I have seen in literally any game. Every other game on the Switch allows you to have multiple game saves, but this one just sucks the fun out of the whole game just because of this design! Please please please please please please fix your horrific system and allow for multiple game saves (multiple islands) and fix the garbage multiplayer system to make it a split screen, or just remove the feature all together.

fierysonic,04-04-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is the greatest game in the series. First off, having one island per switch isn’t too big of a deal. If you feel that this is a major problem. You are sorely mistaken. This game has so many improvements that make it impossible for me to go back to an older version. The biggest of the improvements are as follows: Terraforming, full control over placement of buildings, character customization, local play, even more custom designs and placement of said designs. First, Terraforming gives so much freedom to make your island really yours. And placing the buildings wherever you please just adds to this freedom. Character customization makes your character really feel like you, and allows a whole lot of expression. Local play is new to the series and is decent. Probably the worst new component to the game just because of how it is implemented. And finally custom designs. Custom designs makes it really easy for anyone to create amazing looking clothing and pictures. And you can place them anywhere. Overall, an amazing game.

ToiletCobra,02-04-2020,"I played the original AC to death on my Gamecube back in the day, so I should be the ideal player for this game. But while I've grown this game's shallow formula sure hasn't.

The co-op is medieval and the multiplayer in general is set up in atrocious fashion. But my main complaint is just that this game really brings nothing over 2012's New Leaf and in fact seems like a step back in places (tool durability? Really, Reggie?). Animal Crossing is a game that has a small amount of quality content parceled out each day, much like a mobile game, which then quickly tapers off to painful grinding. That was okay when I was playing New Leaf on my 3DS on the train or wherever, because I had a few minutes to do meaningful content each day while waiting on other stuff, but as a sit-down console game it's just a waste of time and attention.

Even worse in my eyes is how awfully stingy the game is and how strictly it dictates the fun you are allowed to have and when you're allowed to have it. It's like playing a boardgame with a spoiled child who wants to tell you what to do on your own turns. You're constantly being told where to go, which NPC to listen to, what to look at, what your goals should be (regardless of whether you care at all), and then when you're finally let loose it's with a monumental financial yoke around your neck.

Honestly this game feels like a huge load. If you've managed to resist the hype please do give it a pass unless Nintendo eventually does some kind of update to fix things (though don't expect the slog to change, that's here to stay). I'm giving it two points because they certainly made an Animal Crossing game, and this would've been hot **** in 2001, but I don't think I'll pick it up again.

Billmick,25-04-2020,"It pains me to score this game so low, I've actually really enjoyed the first two weeks of gameplay and have been waiting for its release since it was announced.
It retains all the likeable features of the older games in the series and adds a variety of new mechanics and experiences that makes it feel so refreshing to play; easily a 10/10 in that regard.
HOWEVER!
Myself and, as evident from the User Score Distribution above, 50% of the player base were the unlucky ones. How? Let me braked down why this game failed so many people:

1. Shared Console, Shared Island
Now I personally don't mind sharing my Animal Crossing world with my brother. Creating an aesthetic together and foraging really harks back to our childhood. The option to play simultaneously on the one screen is also a great, much needed addition to the series, but why isn't it optional??
Nintendo decided that each Switch console will be limited to ONE ISLAND per system. That means if you and whoever you may share your console with want to play this game, you will be forced to live together on the island indefinitely. All island data is stored locally on the console, so no amount of $$$ spent on separate game cartridges will ever solve this, so if you want a different island, you'll need another console AND another copy of the game.
The Switch is the most powerful and innovative Nintendo system to date, with a default storage of 32GB. Animal Crossing New Horizons is 6.4GB before any save data is stored, and after a combined playtime of 60hrs between myself and my brother, the game now takes up 6.5GB of our total storage! An additional 100MB for two accounts and a whole island?! That's it?! Surely each account could have the option to share an island or have one to themselves?! This is so disheartening as this is such a primitive move by Nintendo... but it's not even the worst.

Now the whole appeal of this new game was the fact that you were no longer limited to only decorating the interior of your home. Placing buildings wherever you want, inviting residents to your town, starting construction on bridges and ramps, the ability to carve rivers into the landscape ... if you were the first user to play the game on your shared console.
Any person who decides to join your island after you will be almost indefinitely restricted to shaking trees, fishing, and popping balloons. Yes of course there are a few more features to play with and enjoy, but how long will these last before they become tedious for player 2?
Unfortunately i was the second user to join a New Horizons island and as I approach my 50th hour of gameplay, I'm beginning to feel ripped off. For any progression to happen to our island requires my brother (player 1) to play the game as much as i do so that he gets the prompt to upgrade the shop, or place a new building, or build a new bridge. And what happens when my bother loses interest in the game? Will I have to consistently log him in and out to progress? Will I have to restart our island? There is a sense of pride and individuality that you hold for your unique villager. Swapping to my brother's villager to receive building privileges would allow me to build the things i want, but deep down I feel I'm being stripped of achievement and that my villager is basically useless.

With these setbacks I believe the game only deserves a 2/10, but I'm holding onto a hope that in a future update Nintendo will fix these issues for their otherwise perfect game.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Mattj317,09-04-2020,"Rip off. In a time when real life resources are scarce due to record shattering global unemployment numbers, the greedy suits at Nintendo expect their loyal fans to shell out hundreds (thousands, depending on household size) of dollars in order for everyone in your household to have the same full game experience. One switch? One game copy? To bad, peasants! Only one member of your house can have the full game experience while everyone else is left chopping wood, clacking stone, and sneaking into their 6 year old's game account at night to see any game progress at all because said 6 year old is a do-nothing Island Rep who only wants to chase butterflies all day. For the uninitiated, the Island Rep is the only player who can trigger missions and game progress. They are the only one who can place structures, complete ""story"" missions, and have access to certain DIY recipes and mission rewards.

You'll never see what's on the other side of that river unless you have a vaulting pole. You'll never have a vaulting pole unless you bring Blathers to the island. And, you'll never bring Blathers to the island unless you have a clandestine play session on your child's account after they fall asleep. Worst yet, you're left explaining to your child why their precious ""common butterlfy"" is no longer in their inventory while your Nintendo overlords greedily lap up the tears of your 6 year old as retribution for your insolence in not shelling out the small fortune to buy 4 Switches and 4 game copies.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Villagers start getting passive aggressive when i talk to them more than one time in a day, I miss when they would ask me for a specific favors, or a fruit to get them, or schedule a time to come hang out at our houses.

If I have to abandon the game every two weeks until the next update it’s not an engaging game.

The fact that the jock villagers ONLY talk about working out gets old soooo quickly. Villager dialogue is so lame and repetitive that I barely talk to my villagers anymore. I just talk to the first 3 I see to get the nook miles and then carry on. Wasted potential, honestly.

Older games had much more dialogue and more personable. Booted up New Leaf the other day and Purrl randomly asked if I believed in UFOs or not. I miss that stuff.

Oh, don't get me wrong, she loves it. But she gets to do anything she wants on it, doesn't she? I don't. I had the unfortunate luck to be the **** that is player 2, and for some reason unknown to anyone with even a modicum of intelligence, Nintendo decided to gate EVERYTHING behind player one's progress.

I can't even get an axe right now. And I am not going to yell at my 10-year old to hurry up. She discovering the game and loving it. I don't want to ruin it for her. If I had the chance to ruin the day/week/life of the developers that thought this was a good idea, I'd take it in a heartbeat, though.

If you want to play an amazing game, live by yourself, or have no worries of completely screwing over everyone else in your house that might want to play this game, go for it. If you have multiple people, make sure you buy multiple copies of the game. Oh, yeah. but multiple switch consoles (one for each person that wants to play) because it is one save per game per console.

Absolutely freaking infuriating, Nintendo. Five games in my house that want to play this - myself, my husband, two of my sons, and my daughter. I already bought the family online account that you force to be a year in length. I've already replaced the freaking POS joycons that are prone to stick drift, and then sent both sets in to get repaired. The console has lost sound from anything but plugging into the dock for HDMI. The left hand rail won't connect to the controller. All of that, and you still have to bend me over and penetrate me with this decision on Animal Crossing.

Art3mis86,26-03-2020,"So let me start with saying that Animal Crossing New Horizons is a great game. The gameplay loop is satisfying, the music is calming, the graphics are cute and the mechanics are simple enough for anyone to grasp. If you are the sole owner of a Nintendo switch, do not share the console with others and are a fan of the genre then purchasing this game is almost a no brainer.

However there is a MAJOR ISSUE with this game and that lies within sharing the game with other profiles on one console. It's a massive shame that greed has taken hold of Nintendo here and has resulted in some extremely anti-consumer practices. Honestly, I expected more from Nintendo. Basically the first profile on the switch to play this game has the full experience (which again, is great), then the following profiles that play have a watered down version of the game, it's almost as if Nintendo are punishing those who don't own their own console. This practice is very old school and Nintendo are obviously way behind in this area. This is almost EA standard of ant-consumerism and they have bucked up their ideas in recent times. I seriously hope Nintendo sort this issue out, mostly because their greed and anti-consumerism is tarnishing and destroying the reputation of a very good game.

YungSambal,27-03-2020,"Me and my little sister were so excited to play the new animal crossing. It's our first animal crossing game, so we couldn't wait to play it. When the game arrived I let her play first, but when I started to play on my Switch account I realized that there were some things off. It appears that you can only have 1 island per Console. That's absolutely ridiculous. There is a reason to have multiple Switch accounts and merging the accounts into 1 game is just wrong. It forces us to buy a new Nintendo Switch so that we both can enjoy the FULL experience. She can play the game normally, but I cannot do certain things like: pick an island, naming the island, build bridges, make houses for visitors, can't have DIY recipies and a lot of other things. I basically can only contribute to my sister's island. It's so annoying and it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. My excitement went from 100 to 0 real quick. I wasn't really following the news before the release, but apparently they mentioned it in a Three Houses demo live stream. I didn't watched the livestream so I didn't know. All the websites where they sell the game also didn't mention it and the website where I bought the game also said nothing about a 1 island per Console thing. Even the trailers didn't mention it. I'm just so mad about this, I've spend 60 euros and I can't even play the full game. I really want to love this game.

What I find despicable is the 2nd, 3rd, etc players not being to experience a real game. You are in fact a villager that the main player allows the ability to do what they want. I don't know who in Nintendo decided that was a good idea, but imagine living in a household where only one person matters and everyone else is subservient to that one person. Kind of goes against the idea of building social ties, sharing and having fun. Sharing in my mind isn't only sharing space, but also in sharing responsibility and choice.

The dictatorial feel of the single console multiplayer of this game destroys its value for me as I'm now subservient to player one. I can't do anything other than farm and wait for player one to plan the city out and progress the story. Imagine save locking a pc so only one player can get to play a game. How ridiculous is that?

Lucishungry,25-03-2020,"My family and I (mom and two daughters) were really hyped about this game because we have all had very strong attachments to past installations to the franchise. We were very excited especially because this game came as a gift from my dear brother, but lo and behold the game locked my daughters from continuation in the game AT ALL. Older installations would share the players in the same town, much like this game, but they DO NOT stop normal progress to secondary players. The most secondary players would have to endure is dealing with whatever name the first player gave the town and sharing a house that could be altered by all of the players on the game. Now, players can’t do so much as chop down a tree or purchase a haircut without going onto the primary account. Usually these problems would be circumvented by buying another game cartridge to create a separate town, but Nintendo has decided to make the game CONSOLE EXCLUSIVE. Not cartridge exclusive which already has a hefty price of $60, but there is a required additional fee of $200 dollars minimum for a switch lite, which has very limited capabilities, or $300 dollars if you want a competent console. Us players will expect to have to pay an additional $240 to $340 dollars should ONE person get their own chance at actually playing the game within a reasonable capacity that the advertisements and previous expectations Nintendo has lead its audience to believe. Maybe this could have been avoided because by simply not purchasing the game, but how should avid fans of the Animal Crossing expect this kind of product to come out as non multiplayer friendly? Others could argue that with the last main game, New Leaf, was single player and that New Horizon is technically multiplayer because there are multiple players existing on the same island. Keyword: existing, not playing. The game should be justifiably playable like, y’know, a game. No less a $60 game. New Leaf was advertised as your own experience and your own town because you are the mayor. This experience is uniquely yours and was advertised as so. Maybe we are expecting too much. Maybe it’s too much to ask for autonomous gameplay for all of the players, despite that capability being apparent in other games on the switch such as Pokémon and on older AC games on inferior consoles, despite the switch being capable of running beautifully rendered and complex games such as Zelda BOTW, it must be too much for the game. Sadly, we were advertised, very strongly might I add, that the game would be capable of multiplayer in its many advertisements. We were told many players can participate in Nintendo’s “Island Paradise” when the reality is that only one player with a sizable sum of money can experience this “Island Paradise” while the secondary players are basically forced to watch as this “Paradise” taunts them for not paying the $300 gateway fee. I hope that future purchasers of the game take all of these points into account and choose to buy this game if they are buying for a single person because this game is by no means suitable for a family or even a pair of friends as turbulence can arise from there being only one person allowed to play the game. My family certainly experienced turbulence and I wish this game has never graced our home. Furthermore, families with multiple switch consoles should wait until the price of the game drops dramatically because other games at a similar price offer so much more.

I am forced to rate this game very low because of the egregious pricing caused by a limitation put on this game. The limitation of only being able to have ONE ISLAND PER CONSOLE. Every other game i have i can share with others in my household. As it currently stands I have to purchase a new console and game per island at a minimum of $400 per save file. On top of this there is no cloud save functionality.

I would happily rate this game a 9 if this wasn't the case but as it stands family's with multiple children are forced to not buy the game or buy multiple switches so each person has the option to play the same game, a requirement that does not exist for any other game I am aware of on any home console.

Klarel,30-03-2020,"My issues with the game are the lack of any sort of meaningful options menu, the tight unforgiving timing requirements for fishing and certain bug catching, and the shear amount of busywork that the game requires you to do in order to progress. The best ways of making money require a good sense of timing, or those activities can easily take twice as long or longer. I admit, I have a bad sense of timing, but i don't play rhythm games, so why are those types of mechanics showing up in a 'relaxing island getaway.'
I feel that the game has zero respect for player time, i.e. the crafting menu is atrocious, and trying to craft multiple things at once is a nightmare, and players are forced to sit through slow (unchangeable) dialog for most actions they take. Also, the arguably biggest achievement (golden tools) are now mostly useless as they only have about 3x the durability of the previous tools.

Emperor_Mercy,01-04-2020,"I'm going to be completely honest, the game actually looks great. The graphics and gameplay are stunning from what i can tell.

However we all know that the one big thing that made me not even play the game at all, is in fact the one island per console limit. What this means is that if you have a family household Nintendo Switch, You ALL have to share 1 island, and if you want another, you have to pay another 350$ bucks. So essentially what happens is if you have switch being shared with multiple people, new islands are behind a 350$ paywall. This is clearly Nintendo's way of stealing money out of pure greed. Please do not fall for this trap, and save your dignity.

Now although the problem is still there, it could still be semi-fixed with a co-op run island. However this is not the case. The account who created the island practically dictates all the major decisions. Everyone else is a ""resident"" or more properly called the working class who literally does nothing other than doing what the person who created island has already completed.

And to top it all off of this crap cake is the fact that you can't back up cloud saves, which means if something happens, that's too bad!

Just expected this to be another great game for the switch and now I'm just disappointed Nintendo would screw users like this. Thanks for wasting my time and money.

AskAtlas,04-05-2020,"I have played Animal Crossing New Horizons and New Leaf, and while New Horizons is a decent game for simple improvements to the ways of game mechanics, it remains imperfect in the aspect that you still have to grind through dialogue to do quality-of-life things like crafting fish bait. However, as I said, it still is better in that aspect over previous installments as your materials automatically stack. Aside from that simple gameplay adjustment, I honestly believe New Leaf, which was on the Nintendo 3DS is better than this Nintendo Switch title. My reasons?

New Leaf put you in a role where you have an entire city at the mercy of your ordinances and it truly felt like you were making a difference in not just your mayor chair, but in the virtual lives of your villagers, whom will occasionally ask you to run errands or generally ask your opinion on something. Sure, New Horizons has the later of that statement, but you can play the entire game and not care about whether a villager leaves because it is very apparent that they are no different than interacting with AOL back in the day. I have told Nintendo these recommendations, but they have yet to listen. I told them that they should re-add the island fruit/tortimer Island/minigames back into the series, considering you are on an island and the multiplayer aspect of it is only really good if your friend needs one of your cherries, as there is no activities for you to do with them and when they visit, perhaps you could play hide and seek since you cannot see them, special npcs, or even your own villagers wondering on the map. It is bad when Pocket Camp, a game that is on the phone, has triple the content of this new installment. Yes, I understand Nintendo said they will update it for up to three years, but it makes a customer like myself believe that Nintendo just released an incomplete product and is trying to intrigue someone with that status for future updates when they cut so much content from the series. You are on an island, cannot dive or swim, cannot find island fruit on island tours, cannot find the DIY recipes you want unless you use third-party sites like Nookazon, and even then, you may not want to deal with someone asking 13 million bells for just 1 cherry.

The bottom line is this game is missing SO MUCH content and I feel a need to play New Leaf because this game is incomplete, lacks anything truly fun, and when Nintendo talks about three years of updates to such a stale game, they basically are telling every customer that bought it that their game, that they pay $60 to have and $20 to play online with, will not be truly complete until three years. You know, part of the fun I have had in New Leaf was time travelling to holidays when I would get bored, but you cannot do that because they are so afraid that people will spoil a holiday that tells people to collect stamps or take a few wedding photos for characters that should have already been in the game for furniture customization. This is the worst animal crossing game I EVER played and maybe after three years it would be the best, but who wants to wait three years to enjoy a game at full experience?

FYI, all these positive reviews on here seem to be made by someone who was paid to say those things because how can they be okay with a secondary player feeling left out in their experience? How could they defend this trash of a game that should have not been released till evidently three years later when it would be complete? I am not saying it isn't an enjoyable game, but try New Leaf before you leave your review; I bet your opinion will change because compared to New Leaf, this is a skeleton in the series, waiting for meat and skin to be truly whole.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
tzted,09-05-2020,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME if you have more than one person who wants to play this on the same Switch.

Animal Crossing (AC) continues with it's tried and tested formula of grind materials to make things to sell in the grind for bells (Capitalism at it's best). In the words of Tod Howard, it just works. And that's fine, this game has and will always be, a grind. MMOs thrive off this and so does AC. And for Player 1, AC ties in some thin story to help make the grind feel like an achievement. For ANY other player, you're stuck in an endless loop of grind WITHOUT any story.

For additional Players (do remember that Nintendo have a ONE ISLAND per Switch policy), there is no story and so no achievement reward for improving the island and so you're forced into essentially a glorified Fishing Simulator. Craftable items that are locked to the story, yeah, Player 1 will have to craft them and give them to the additional players (some of these do appear in the shop once unlocked, but not all).

It screams cash grab from Nintendo, forcing parents to purchase multiple Switch devices for the warring kids over who should be Player 1 and get the full AC experience or be relegated to a Player controllable NPC. For the price of another Switch plus the game, I can see why Nintendo would be rather slow to patch this as the longer it goes, the more devices they'll likely sell.

My suggestion is, as the first line says, NintenDON'T buy this game if you share your Switch. If you're a lone Switch Wielding Warrior, then I can recommend this to a point. As others have said, there should be two scores for this title, as 2 is a bit low for the single player experience. However, it is advertised as a Multiplayer game, which it clearly is not.

I can understand why people are annoyed by the fact that is only one island per switch, but is a nice coop too, for people who share island, to build it together, i am doing it with my little brother and we talk about what happens to one or another in the island. Althrough only I am the founder of the island, he can do the same things than me, so is the same gameplay for us both.
The art, as music, graphics and gameplay looks good, it just feels the way it must, I think, but there are things that could be better, for example at buying many things, i would like to buy 31 thibgs for examole, instead of doing it in packs of 5, or individually.

-Unable to unlock the DIY recipes acquired through progressing game -Lacks access to purchasing items from the catalog that the representative player has bought/unlocked
-Cannot use or unlock emotes -Cannot increase relationship with villagers
-The non-RR is unable to progress in the game beyond what the representative player has made that day. And often, not even that and is unable to progress at all
-The second player serves almost no purpose. If you share an island and are the non-RR character, the game is rendered essentially pointless. It desperately needs to be patched",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Basically only the first player has some kind of story, all others just don't, therefore it is just plain boring.
Sharing the island in itself is no problem for me at all, but not being able to do all things I want to do, without switching character, is.

This mad my sister very upset seeing as she had just payed $90 to play this game and now she was stuck on 2% of it. After searching many websites I found that there was no way for her to get a new island or even tools so I made the decision to delete the file I had spent hours on so that my sister could play.

lambdafish,22-03-2020,"As a ""player 2"", Nintendo has essentially told me that I can't ever play properly on the game that I share. In theory, sharing an island works, and many games have succeeded in this. The resources most definitely should be independent per player so that everyone has stuff they can do, the fact that it doesn't literally makes the game unplayable in large households and families that share a switch because one player will perform all of the activities, filling their NookMiles, leaving nothing left for anyone else to do. Sharing an island at all should be a choice, and the game itself should be designed around sharing, with safeguards allowing every player to fully enjoy the game. At present this is far from the case and it leaves an extremely poor play experience for ""player 2's"" and even Players 1's to a certain extent. Unless this is changed, the game is worthless to me and many others, therefore I can't give any score other than 0.

And to anyone saying that people giving negative reviews over a single, ""minor"" feature/complaint, and are trying to counterbalance the score to ""drown out the whiners"", remember that the people reviewing these low scores literally cannot experience the game that you are giving 10's for because of this problem.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Jemsutton,21-03-2020,"I honestly think this game was incredibly well made and was excited to delve further into it. Unfortunately, I live in a household with multiple people and only one Switch and the game only allows 1 island per Switch console. Furthermore the game is designed to give the person who initially creates the island far more agency than players who join afterwards (naming the town, doing initial town building quests). Additionally the game does not account for multiple people being on the island and always generates the same amount of resources per day, meaning anyone that plays after someone else is liable to not find any wood, stone or fruit until the next literal day of the week. All of this combines to make the local multiplayer experience terrible. All other games on the switch allow for different user profiles to create new save files, why is this not the case for Animal Crossing? On Gamecube I was able to buy another memory card to create another town, for New Horizons I would have to buy a completely new Switch and copy of the game to have another island. Do not buy this game if you have brothers, sisters, parents, friends, lovers, dogs or grandparents interested in playing it, unless of course you're somehow not affected by the global pandemic and can drop another 500 dollars so you can both play happily.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Gamer4Life137,21-03-2020,"Only allowing one island per console is terrible and Nintendo should be ashamed of the state this game is in. Storytime: two days before launch, I read about this one island policy and was terrified. I don't have a lot of money, so my girlfriend and I share a switch and don't buy many games. She doesn't play much, so I was thrilled when Animal Crossing was announced because it looks like her type of game. Fast forward to me learning about the island, and I expressed my concerns to her. She said to me that it would be okay and we would just share. To my dismay, sharing is not an option. Only the primary player can progress the game. Any big progression moments must be done only by the one player. Any additional players just have to exist and not partake in progression. That is evil. This is the worst thing I've seen from Nintendo. I played for two hours and decided to stop and let my girlfriend play. Again, I couldn't believe how terribly the second player is treated. No new resources spawn for each player. I only played for two hours and it was enough for it to be impossible for her to progress in any capacity. She has now decided she will never play again because she tried to play but wasn't able to since she hit a complete brick wall after ten minutes. We tried to figure it out on the second day, and ultimately this game is not compatible with multiple players. If you are the only person on the switch, this game is great. If you have anyone else at all who playsthe console, the game does not work. I'm giving this a 0/10 because of how disappointed and sad my girlfriend is. Games should not bring this much upset to anyone. Games are to enjoy, not to make you miserable. Nintendo is evil. This game is terrible. I hope they patch it out but I know they won't.

Because the game is effectively good for one person per console, so if you expect to get the full experience of the game (which I'm sure you do), you'll need to buy one Switch per player. Yup, one Switch per player. For some god awful reason, Nintendo decided it was reasonable to ship the game in a state where only user per Switch gets to play the full game.

Don't want to shell out $300 for another Switch per player? Then you can look forward to being constantly gated by the primary player's progress at every turn, having zero role in building out your island and its residents, missing all the major story moments (unless you use the equally awful local coop mode, more on that below), and having to buy all the tools and recipes the primary player gets for free.

Planning on only playing together using local coop? That helps with not missing out on the story beats, but expect all but the ""leader"" player to be little more than a glorified spectator. ""Follower"" players cannot talk to villagers, access their inventory, pick things up without a long animation for each item, choose where to go, enter/exit buildings, use the tool belt, and worst of all: only the leader will receive any of the quest rewards or world drops.

The game still gets a two star from as I'm sure playing as the primary or sole player is still very fun. To anyone like me who was looking forward to playing this on a shared console: Be warned, you're getting a fraction of the content.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

For those new to the game, yes it revolves around you paying off your debt to a capitalist raccoon, but the tasks you undertake to reach that frankly easy goal are fishing, catching bugs and more, things that play well into the concept of something relaxing.

While the restriction of one island to console is interesting, I believe it was a choice made to tie it into the other games which have had the same gesture to allow for people to work together on the same island and grow it as a group, while also limiting play time so that one can experience other things.

Bobasaur,28-03-2020,Completely unacceptable to restrict the multiplayer to one island per switch and only allow the main resident to progress the game. How can Nintendo market itself as the “family” gaming console and make a decision that is such a slap in the face to families? Do you know frustrating it is for parents with multiple kids?

StopHatingbro,07-04-2020,"Don't listen to anyone about the 1 island thing, this is probably one of the best games in the series. Sure you start off with one island, but you gain terraforming to grow them, and you can use another in-game currency, Nooks Miles, to buy a ticket to an uninhabited island, sometimes even friends will be there from past games to invite back. There is no frame drops and a lot more improvement when it comes to graphics, you can change the music on the island and place where you'd like most buildings and structures to go for your society. It's the same animal crossing with improvements. There is plenty more to decorate your house with, multiple rooms along with the expansion of your house, and Isabelle.... just Isabelle. Upgrades for inventory, tools, overall improvements to the hud, I could go on forever, a lot of these people are mad about a single island, but it's the size of a single town in Animal Crossing, so a lot of people are crybabies, because not only can you visit other islands in multiplayer, but if you don't have friends visiting villagers in game invite you to theirs and you can go to uninhabited ones.

Nachtetraume,24-03-2020,"New Horizons did just that, opened up new horizons for the Animal Crossing series. The new crafting aspect was something I originally wasn't sure I was going to like but I have taken to and really enjoy. Previous titles would just have you doing tasks for your villagers and just catching bugs and fish all day long. New Leaf turned a new leaf making you the mayor of a town and setting up a beautiful location. Now you've got the full reign of the island to make it whatever you want. Having the ability to place villager homes so they don't ruin your flower garden or paths? YES PLEASE! Being able to terraform the land/water scape to make it flow however you want and fill in weird gaps of the map? I'll take it! There's so much to this game that is absolutely amazing and a labor of love from Nintendo.

Socially it does require Nintendo Online to visit your friends. That's pretty common at this point for most game titles for any platform. I find having one island per switch to be amazing. You can share your game cartridge and not worry about someone destroying your hard work when you get it back.

CkRules,24-03-2020,"I'm a long time fan of the Animal Crossing series and this is by far my favorite! The crafting system is awesome and the ability to have 8 players on a single island is awesome. It seems a lot of people don't get the community aspect of this series, and want to complain about the single island per console deal. I can understand why you would want the option to make a brand new save without loosing your original, but to complain that you and your wife cant have seperate islands, really misses the point of this long standing series. Why wouldnt you want to share an island with your wife or kids ...thats the point. Everyone gets to participate together, to create an awesome island that can be built over, literally, years. My wife and I work together to create a happy and healthy community. You can terraform the terrain, craft new items, work together to populate the museum, and more! This is a community building game. The only improvment I would have liked is for everyone in a multiplayer session to have imidiate access to their items without having to switch leaders. The fact you can only have one Island per system isnt a deal breaker, at all. People want to think that Nintendo did this solely for the purposes of selling more Switches, but the way I see it, this is more of a system built to prevent exploiting the game. As I recall, the only game that didnt limit the number of islands per console was the original, and that worked cuz the online capabilitiesof the game cube were very limited. Even the Ds games worked like this. And sure, it would have been cool if they could have solved this in a different way...but the switch doesnt save to the game cartridge, they are read only memory cards. So your island MUST be tied to your internal storage of the Switch. If everyone could make multiple islands, then the game would be very exploitable. I wish that Nintendo could have solved this problem while still allowing multiple islands, or at least one Island per account, but then anyone could make multiple accounts and create. But in New Leaf, i didnt see nearly as much hate for the fact that you had to buy the game twice to make a new file. And like I said, Switch carts are read only, so the game save has to be tied to the console. They could have done cloud storage, but that would mean any user without a subscription is locked out of the game. If Ni te di really wanted to milk their customers, they would ha e provided all the tools and recipies and exclusive tools and recipes, for purchase online. But no. You get the whole game and never have to pay another cent to enjoy it.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
JTShadow,24-03-2020,"A near perfect implementation of a classic series! This is an early review but so far the game has everything you've come to love in the series with new features added to help keep you engaged in the game.

Quality of life improvements were implemented such as icons notifying you if an item has been donated to the museum already though I do wish that feature was extended to all items in general to make it easier to determine what you already have in your catalog. One common complaint I hear echoed is the fact that you can only have one island per system/cartridge but that is only a minor issue, especially with the lower cost of a Switch Lite. One wouldn't expect to share one cartridge and one 3ds and have multiple towns with New Leaf, so this expectation for the Nintendo Switch is pretty entitled.

ReaperAvarynii,25-03-2020,"Effort was definitely made on this game. I can tell that there are different types of things to do in game. However I almost guarantee that I will never get there. For now, I really like the game. For now. Multiplayer is awful, I bought it so my wife and I could enjoy something fun and it turns out that second player is just one person as the leader and the other follows them around pretty much unable to do anything but pick stuff up. Pointless and not worth setting up in the first place. As far as online goes I won't even bother trying it. Having 8 people able to draw off of my already dismal material sources at anytime just isn't feasible. Iron nuggets are hyper rare at best. I get one on average for every two days I play. I think the idea behind this is to encourage online play.

At first I was super excited, this is a new and unique concept to me. I don't predict I am going to care enough about it to play more than a week or so. I have a situation in which I need a tiny number of iron nuggets and at the pace I'm going I'll have flat gotten tired of trying. You can spend certain currency to go to vacant islands and take supplies, but you will only get so much of that currency so if you don't think before you spend you will find yourself in short supply and only able to get a bit every day.

The whole game appears to be geared towards tiny amounts of play time. At an hour every day I have ran all but the most common resources out. Even weeds no longer spawn on the parts of the island I can reach. If I have two inventories of high value items to sell, the second inventory (And so on) always seems to sell for substantially less which means it becomes annoying trying to grind for money.

Tools that last require resources that I can't afford to spare if I want to progress the game, so I am currently unable to craft them. This was a terrible oversight at best. I've resorted to making cheap tools over and over again and have ultimately found they are more cost efficient in the long run.

I can't recommend this game. I will continue to hang in there and update my review for as long as I can hold my attention on the game but again I doubt I'll even still keep it downloaded on my switch past a week or two.

cedarlj,25-03-2020,"$60 is a lot of money to spend for only one person to be able to have a well-rounded experience on a video game. I have two sisters who also were excited to play the game, but despite them BOTH having their own Nintendo accounts and online accounts too, they were booted up onto my island with not much to do. I considered even buying them their own copies of the game, but upon further investigation that isn’t enough to allow them to play their own game. So if we all wanted to have our own islands, we would each need to buy our own Switch and copies of the game. This is so ridiculous, it seriously ruined the experience of the game for me (and obviously my sisters too). Not about to drop $600+ just for us to play a game together, I can’t believe Nintendo set it up like this. Isn’t it enough to have bought one system (already $300, a decent chunk of money), each of us to be paying for our own Online subscriptions, and to have gotten the $60 game disc? They need to fix this ASAP.

LordSpook,25-03-2020,"Hey, first time Reviewer. I know that's gonna auto-discount my review in some eyes, but I've just never been insulted by a game enough that I felt the need to actually make an account and warn people. So please, take it from me, a genuine end user. It's not just pointless negativity. Something tells me the critics never played multiplayer. These dev's are trying to **** you. Now with that out of the way, let us proceed.

Animal Crossing: New Horizons promises to let you travel to and inhabit a deserted Island. It reels you in by telling you, ""It won't be like before, we swear!"" like an abusive ex.

Don't worry you'll be able to move houses and services at your leisure! (Eventually and for 30k/50k per building) You'll be able to terraform* the island to your vision. (Again, eventually, and not anything on the shores.) You can even live there with your whole family!* (If you don't mind anyone besides the first resident being treated like glorified visitors with a house.)

Oh but only one island per switch guys because... we want everyone to buy their own switch. (in a global recession because the average family has tons of excess money right now, and definitely aren't all living way below the poverty line. Greetings from America!)

Here is what they don't tell you:
1. Only the first resident can advance the main plot points, and unlock those features they lured you in with. If you aren't first resident, you won't even be able to see the recipe's for the objects/furniture you'll be forced to craft, in order to advance the plot.
2. You have to build everything on this island for everyone one. Don't invite people to live there cause it's gonna be you grinding all day e'ery day for the resources. Not really the Island vacation package it was sold as.
3. there is Inconvenience baked into the game. Half of the upgrades just get rid of some annoying inconvenience that you were just putting up with. Advance the plot (if you are first resident) to have a slightly less miserable time. I think that's a really lazy and corrupt form of game progression, used only by those that lack the imagination necessary to offer genuinely fulfilling progression rewards. I'ts like hide and seek but you get to remove your blindfold after thirty games (or something.)

Also ignore any excuse that these annoyances are in the game to ensure fairness, because there are already many money exploits in the game. So in the end it's kinda like the Games for Windows Live disaster of yore. You know, that time when Microsoft thought it was cool to sabotage the stability and enjoyment of their games in the hopes of preventing piracy, which happened anyways. Hamstringing your product to preserve ""fairness"" is a fools errand. you might as well ask the sun not to rise.

So the main issue is, if you buy this game you are telling Nintendo that this is an okay business model. ""Naw it's cool, us consumers are total suckers. Hey if another Zelda game comes out make sure that only the first person on the console to play the game can advance the plot. so you can force us to buy more switches.""

Other than all that total BS, it had some pretty enjoyable aspects. For one, you don't need to take a freaking personality test to change your hair color. (These developers are asinine.) And everything was pretty much 24/7 until we made progress. (then it went back to their traditional stance of, **** night owls."") But as soon as I found out the game was just gonna treat me like a chump indefinitely, like unpaid labor, it kinda drained any aspect of ""working for fun"" from the game.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

Wmsoberanis,26-03-2020,"I’m a huge fan of AC. This game is no exception. That being said, my biggest fault with this game is that I’m the 2nd player. I can not do anything unless player 1 progresses in the game or I just fork out $300 for another switch and I’m sorry but I’m not buying a 2nd switch just to be able to progress in the game. Not happening! I believe if they allow individual players to have their own island, this would solve most negative reviews. You could allow all players to make choices, but then you run the risk of players unable to enjoy the full experience of the game as players would start arguing when someone places something in an area they didn’t want it to go. I get that this would open up the possibility for people to cheat and create multiple accounts and have multiple islands, which seems to be the likeliest of reasons when I searched why this wasn’t a feature already. The only issue with that is, people always find ways to cheat and if they do than that hinders their experience and it’s their choice so why alter our experience to keep them from doing something they are probably already doing anyway? Please fix this issue, I’d really like to enjoy all this game has to offer as I did so in the past with all your other games!!!!",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

Kwek,28-03-2020,"As somebody who actually plays the game with 2 players on one console instead of just complaining about it. I actually like this feature, it gives us a lot more interaction with each other. After reading some of the reviews I've seen a lot of misinformation about the 1 island rule. My point is don't trust these 1 or 0 ratings who haven't even given the game a chance or even touched the game.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
MGSplayer1,29-03-2020,"The game is lovely. It is adorable when it can be, and frustrating when it has to be (I'm looking at you, fishes). Some game improvements make the experience much better than the games before it and some fixes need to be made like crafting items in stacks and buying multiple items at once in some sort of catalogue type of system like in Dragons Dogma.

However, there is one major issue that will result in a protest rating of 1 until it gets resolved and that is the 1-island-per-switch rule. The irony that a family console with a game about family is tearing families apart because of the restriction is baffling. The greed that Nintendo has shown recently is making it so that their image is heavily tarnished. You have YouTubers calling it out, you have review sites calling it out, you have gamers on Metacritic calling it out. There is no winning out of this and if they would like to see the rating of the game that is deserving of an 8 or higher they need to address the issue and either release a patch that makes it so separate accounts can have different islands, or succumb to the fall of the rating of the game they worked hard on.

Make your choice, Nintendo. There is only one way you can win this and ignoring it will ensure that you lose.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

It is absolutely ludicrous that you cannot create an island per profile and expect us to fork out for another 2,3,4? Consoles if you live in a household where more than one person wants their own experience.

Tarynbethp,30-03-2020,"I bought this game for my daughter and I to play. I've been a long time Animal Crossing player, and I got her started on the franchise as soon as she was old enough to play. We had both been anticipating the game for months. I let her start the game and enjoy it for a few days before I logged into my switch profile and started my game. I was extremely disappointed to see that it put me on my daughter's island, and I can participate as a glorified visitor. I cannot progress the game in any way. If she collects all the fruit before me for the day, I cannot gather any. As a secondary player, you can basically decorate a house, and interact with the environment, but nothing further. I understand that even if you buy another came card, you cannot have your own island. The only way to do that is to spend $200-$300 for an additional Switch console. And another $60 for a second game copy if you want to play together or at the same time. Seems like a big money grab from Nintendo to sell more Switch consoles.

Oldbutterface,31-03-2020,"Bought this game for me and my girlfriend to both play. The 'one island per switch' rule is dumbfounding. For a series that's supposed to be all about creativity and exploration, this unnecessary decision completely undermines that as we are both limited to one tiny island.

However what's really annoying is that my girlfriend is the primary resident so she gets to do all the fun stuff whereas all I can do is harvest resources. None of the NPCs really care about me at all, I have nothing to do to progress anything, my progress actually is hindered, and the experience generally sucks ass. Not really a £50 experience in my opinion.

I'm not going to buy a 2nd switch just to have my own experience. That's totally ridiclous. I'm disappointed in you nintendo as you were the last gaming company catering for families and multiplayer but this decision is stupid and just comes across as greed. There is no reason for this. I get you may be worried about resource harvesting manipulation but this is animal crossing so who cares?

Cant see this having a long shelf life in my collection tbh because after the initial novelty I've realised im just left with an empty shell of a game while primary resident player 1 gets the full experience.

This is fixable. Patch it and allow multiple islands per switch. I know why you didn't want to do this, but in limiting all users to one island, you limit all fun to one player and resource gathering is torturous.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
sadhusband,01-04-2020,"Bought this game for my wife's birthday to play together and I am very disappointed we can't enjoy the game as equals. I was so excited about being able to play together on one island to collaborate and work together. However, as the second person to join I cannot contribute to building new shop or choosing their location. When playing local co-op the controls for both players is reduced, upgrades like item wheel cannot be used, opening your inventory interrupts the other player's actions, like pulling out their fishing line for no reason! The secondary player is trapped in a ""little-brother mode"" where they can't even pick up items or leave the view of the leader player. Shaking the controller to swap leaders is helpful but doesn't make up for how limited this mode is.

The game is very fun but as the second player I cannot enjoy the game fully. I hope that Nintendo will either improve local co-op by giving all switch users full island access, improving co-op controls and adding true split screen, or worst case scrapping one island all together and giving all users their own save file.

Expecting couples to pay at minimum $560 (2 Switches, 2 game copies, 2 online subscriptions), and even more for larger families, for each person to fully be able to experience Animal Crossing and play together is just absolutely unacceptable and needs to be fixed.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

So far, the game is very relaxing to play. I appreciate the slow pace and happy cutesy design of the characters. I find myself wanting to build the perfect island for my friends, the characters I like and me. The major holdup I have is the confusion that comes with trying to do all of that.

Some of the requirements to accomplish certain goals are obscure and hidden. Making money feels like a grind. Villagers only visit my campsite so few and far between that I wonder how long it will take me to find the perfect characters for my island. I don't know how to gain new DIY recipes to keep making my island beautiful!

I won't stop playing the game for a while, but I will not be playing for hours on end like I did when I first bought it.

The game is the best the series has ever been, and with a constantly changing game like this vs its predecessors makes for a more long lasting game.

Prrgangsta,10-04-2020,"So this was my first introduction into animal crossing and I gotta say that I'm not all that impressed with the game. It is a very repetitive life sim game that loses interest after so many days of playing. Everyday I do the same thing. Wake up, find my daily bell tree, plant another bell tree, check turnip prices (which always suck for me), check the hot item, and then scavenge for the resources and fossils (or anything donatable to the museum) on my island. That's what I do everyday and it is kind of driving me crazy.

The villagers don't feel like they have a purpose to be there but to be there. There are plenty of games that do the life sim thing better and add a bit more content than this series.

It's not an awful game but it doesn't grab me like other games. Also it is kind of messed up Nintendo made it 1 island per switch instead of per profile. It's 2020 guys, there should be no excuse for such a thing.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

bobbykjack,27-04-2020,"This is one of the few honest reviews of Animal Crossing New Horizons you'll see. It's not amazing, it's not terrible. It has its moments and is certainly a different type of game than you might be used to. Very little in the way of an objective, very relaxing, very annoying in terms of repeated dialogue and some awkward controls.

It's relaxing in a kind of 'do nothing' way and it's all innocent and charming and a nice non-threatening world to dip into now and again. But it's not exactly thrill-filled or the kind of challenge you'll get from a typical game.

I couldn't care less about multiple players because I'm the only one who plays on my Switch, but if you share your console, your mileage might vary. Doesn't deserve a 10, certainly doesn't deserve a 0. Solid 7/10 game.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Ryijun,11-07-2020,"Absolutely do not understand the negativity on Metacritic around this game. People went completely mad in the process, as with the Last of Us 2. In Animal Crossing, you want to come back again and again. And you can't play much in one sitting. But that's the point. The desire and ultimate goal in the game is the same-to collect all the items, which are simply unthinkable huge number. And how you will achieve this and how quickly you will get bored is everyone's business. But this game must be played by everyone who has a Switch. Good graphics, nice character style, nice music (the first 30 hours, then the sound turns off:)), interesting opportunities to rebuild your own island, a lot of events, which are also linked to the online, the change of seasons and of course the time that corresponds to the real. Fishing, catching insects, mining, growing trees, settling residents in the form of various animals, collecting shells on the beach, swimming. It seems to be simple things, but how well it is organized. Separately, I would also like to mention online trading with real people. The same items accumulate a lot over time and they need to be put somewhere. Some things are a pity to throw away, so they can be safely sold, for an adequate amount of course. Go to Nookazon and everything will be. In General, even after 490 hours that have already been spent in the game, there is something to do.

seiji092,07-06-2020,"I would give a 10, but this game definitely needs some fine tuning, which Nintendo will probably not listen to. Let us not forget who are we talking about after all.
The main reason is the stupid progress being restricted to the first player who boots the game and you can only have a single island per console. The player 1 is the island representative who can makes the progress, everyone who enters the island is unable to make any such progress. For this person the score might be 10.
Overall, AC is a game where you create a bond with all your villagers and town. You get this change of pace from our fast IRL and see your little village growing into a teeming town, very slowly if you don't change your in-game time and to me, it's that feature that really makes the AC unique.
Some quality of life tweaks are very needed to make the game more enjoyable IMHO. Such as, bulk crafting, shopping cart in the clothes store and many more.

GreenGamerGure,15-06-2020,"First of all, I want to say to all players who have given a bad review to this game, due to the creation of only one island per nintendo switch, that this has been this way ALWAYS. If you have played before the AC for Gamecube, City folk, Wild World and New Leaf, ALL OF THEM, only allowed the creation of one city, town, or whatever. All of the other games didnt recieve a negative rating due to this, so please, if you are new in AC, I suggest that you should inform yourself before buying the game.

Now, putting all that anger aside.... Animal Crossing New Horizons it's been the best game of the series.
*DIY recipes: A whole new feature that makes you work hard to get specific items and even trade recipes with other players
*Event and new features updates: Allowing you to have more special visitors, more DIY recipes, more festival events, new building upgrades, etc.
*Clothing: A huge amount of clothing, costumes and more. All of the clothing with vivid colors and an excellent design.
*New villagers and new ways to get them: New flashy and adorable villagers like Raymond, Judy, Shreb, etc. And also the new feature: campsite, where you can get a random new villager. You can now help/avoid villagers to leave your island and they cannot move out without your concern. Additionally, if a villager moves out you can invite friends or other people to come and pick up villagers to move to their islands.
*Nookmiles program: Doing specific activities will allow you to redeem Nook miles, which can be used for Nook Mileage Items or for Dodo Mystery tours. These activities vary from completing one time only objectives, to random daily chores.
*Dodo Mystery tours: Allowing you to go to randon small islands where you can not only get more resources but even find a new villager
*Enhanced online mode: Even though it sometimes crashes, this mode is way better than in the other games. Allowing you to trade, explore, fish, catch bugs, get new DIY, talk with special guests and more.

In short, if you are looking ofr a life simulation game and love animals, designing and even interacting with other people online, this game is definitely for you. Highly recommended :)!

It is a fun game, very addicting. I've never been able to get into animal crossing until now. There's something about turning an empty island into a bustling city that appeals to me. Despite the overwhelming amount of games available to me at the moment, I have played animal crossing for at least 250 hours, which is not something I can say of many games.
You start off on an empty island in a tent and then work your way up to better housing through loans from the resident loan shark (with no interest, oddly enough). Little by little you improve your island and your house and soon garner villagers to populate your village. You can pull weeds, catch bugs, fish, dig for fossils, design clothes, flags and a great many other things. It does get a bit repetitive, but is fun for me nonetheless. If you are the only person on your switch and you enjoy that kind of gameplay loop, this might be the game for you.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Ryno_III,21-08-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a good game, but I would be amiss to discuss the issues. The game has received a lot of hate for it and that's why the User score is so poor. So how do I feel about this game?

Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a fun game that you can spend over a hundred of hours in the game. There's so much variety and there's a lot to do. There are a lot of items to collect and a lot to customize your island. There's a huge cast of characters each with their own personality. It's also nice to visit a bunch of other islands. There's so many insects, fish, fossils, and paintings to collect and it's a nice and calm game to play.

The problems? The game is very slow (I'll explain) and plagued by a lot of bizarre problems that is dumbfounding that Nintendo refuses to fix. So let's discuss each one.

1. The local multiplayer. It's effectively useless. You'll need to create a new profile on another user on the Switch. Once you got the other player... they can't do anything useful. You'll essentially just follow the designated leader and you can use tools. How fun.

2. The game is ""slow"". No text speed options and every time you talk with someone, there is a lot of repeated and useless text. It results in button mashing to skip the same dialogue. It's a time waster. This is true for a lot of things in this game... it's not a game breaker.. but it's certainly a bit annoying.

3. One island per switch. The first player to open the game will become the main account. If you share a switch and have multiple playing the same game, stay away from this game. The main account is the only account that will allow the game to progress in a meaningful way. If you want to switch who is the main account, you'll have to reset the game and clear all data. Seriously? But why?

All negative things aside, it's a nice game. If you're a true gamer, I don't see this necessarily being a game for you. It's a family friendly game perfect for kids, girlfriends, non-gamers, and adults that aren't big on games. If you want to share the game with someone, don't.... You'll need a switch per person and a copy of the game per person. AC:NW is a nice game. They are updating the game with free updates and I still have a bit of fun playing it a 1-2 hours per day.

NinWiidle,28-04-2020,"First Things first: The one Island per console thing is nothing new for the series, and isn't really a problem imo. The problem is the lack of progression for the players outside of the Citizen Representative. With that out of the way, I can get to gushing: This game is ABSOLUTELY gorgeous, and all the additions feel like a true step forward for the series. The ability to place furniture outside is HUGE, and all the creativity that results from Terraforming has basically resulted In an Animal Crossing Renaissance. The same-switch co-op is cool and a nice addition, but Isn't something you'll use much outside of the first few days. The game does fall short in a couple areas: An (initial) lack of content, a lack of online modes(Like Tortimer Club), and a VERY slow start.

This game feels like if the series skipped New Leaf and built off of City Folk, but kept the characters from New Leaf.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

LazyLoad08,16-04-2020,"I feel like this game is either getting hailed as one of the greatest or hated on for its flawed local multiplayer aspect. As I'm the only one playing on my Switch, that does not bother me and nothing is stopping me from joining the ones praising this game greatly.
However, I feel like the game is just... good. I get that it's not designed to take hours of your time daily, but I felt on the first day that it was just extremely empty and it was quite off-putting. Then I began questioning my decision to buy the game; fortunately, there is more to do in the next days.
Some criticism comes from the ""click A-fest"" that occurs during some conversations. Some people defend it by saying it's a part of the game and it helps the immersion. Well... I would agree if the dialogue would get switched up and I wouldn't need to repeat four choices after getting an error or missclicking the last one. Unfortunately, there is no variance and no new lines. Everyone just keeps repeating their own spiel. Doing things like museum donations or flying to another islands gets super tedious and annoying rather fast. The constant interruptions in multiplayer don't add to the charm either. Read that as: the multiplayer in this game is completely atrocious and utterly useless.
Content wise the game is good and I feel there is still more for me to uncover. As I like this kind of games in general, I look forward to it - but I have to acknowledge it's definitely not for everyone.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

All we have to worry about on this island is how to decorate our home, design our own island and live our life to the fullest. I know it's just a game and I know that is has its faults and points of criticism, but in the end you are getting an experience.

Then when I came back I noticed that his airport was near where my air port was then I saw my house and before I could say anything he put his tent down and now it is just f#*king stuck in my game. This is the most aggravating cheap a$$ move I've ever seen Nintendo pull. This game would straight up be a 10 if my brother didn't exist or much better if Nintendo had more than one f%#king brain cell.

While being a relaxing town/island building game mixed with various different things like Fishing, Bug Catching and TERRA-FORMING This game has soooo many things for player to catch and do.

The bugs and fishes in the game go to Blathers the owl (He hates bugs... so make sure you ask him about every bug you find) The owl then takes the creatures too your Islands HUGE museum! This building is beautiful! the fossil section is the coolest part in my own opinion, it has a very cool trail that shows how the dinosaurs evolved and what there ancestors are in current day. Make sure you invite your buds to a museum date (and also to flex your fish you caught and they cant cause they are in a different hemisphere) and to show the beautiful and fun spaces around the fun place.

OK now here is the part where i get a little mad at Nintendo. Listen... I REALLY like this game, but it SUCKS that my Identical Twin brother who ive played couch co-op since the Days of halo reach, cant own his own island. When i told him that he couldn't, he got excited we could live together... but the drawbacks are just too much... now he just sits there across the room playing Doom Eternal instead of helping me bully a owl with insects for a hour or two.

Mefis,26-03-2020,"This game in itself is excellent. HOWEVER it has a big flaw that ruins everything, the way the game despises secondary players. Secondary players are practically in-game visitors, spectators who can hunt insects and fish, collect fossils and buy items, and nothing else. For the progress of the island, secondary players need the main player, the first player who played and created the island. Sharing the island is great, it is in keeping with the spirit of the saga, what is outrageous is that the game does not allow secondary players to do anything. The secondary players cannot, for example, create new constructions, such as bridges or the store, they cannot donate materials for the construction of these projects ... In addition they also do not have access to a significant amount of item recipes ... They cannot participate in the missions of the game ... That is NOT FUN. This game should be appropriate to share with your family or your partner, with your loved ones, but clearly Nintendo does not want that. Nintendo wants you to buy a new Switch to play the full version of the game ... Attention! Not a new copy of the game, but a damn new console!

Renmir,28-03-2020,"Pros:
-Great early/mid game
-It's exciting to keep catch new creatures
-Gardening is fun early game
-Conversations with animals are fun early/mid game
-Crafting system is amazing
-Multi-player is fun early game

Cons:
-Conversations are repetitious after a while
-Getting a villager to leave is almost impossible without cheating. Please add a feature of some sort where you can choose an option in ""Red Text"" three days in a row to get a villager to leave. People are going to time travel anyways.
-Playing multiplayer with friends should not take so long each time to have someone come into your island. It's disrupting. The individual player should see the traveling screen, and then just pop a notification when it's been loaded into their friend's island.
-You can only play one profile per Switch. Same console multiplayer isn't fun. Split-screen or individual menus would have been better, as well as not having only one person who can make decisions. It's a family console - Resident Representative should be a shared title, so they can all move things the way they want, or even have their own islands and use Call Resident to play them on the same island but keep menu functions.
-No way to rotate camera for pictures, except to angle up. You can do it inside, why not outside?
-Shopping gets boring after a while. Could the furniture selection change maybe twice daily? 7am and 7pm would be good I think. Or make a multiplayer selling option, bring back Reese and Cyrus to sell things to other players for you for a price you set (no more than a certain percentage over their regular price)
-More visitors to campsite, more frequently. Let them teach players new patterns specific to that character. If each character had more specialty items it would be great.
-Pocket camp lets you invite people to hang out, so why can't you here? Maybe be able to ask a villager to come hang out, they leave after 3 hours and are unavailable for x number of hours/days. This way people could rotate and see the characters more, and get unique things for them",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Helpfulreview,28-03-2020,"This is a good game to play Single Player. Quality gameplay, unique characters, not overly complicated. Just an enjoyable game. For anyone who has played the original Animal Crossing on the gamecube you will probably be the most upset. Because you probably played with family members at the time, and enjoyed the minor multiplayer setup it had back then. This version has somehow managed to ruin even that minimal multiplayer functionality from back then.The trade off I suppose is that they enabled an okay form of online play. But when it comes to Animal Crossing the most enjoyable way to play was with others locally who could setup shop in the same town.They would be able to progress the town if you weren't there, interact with the town folk, the folk then mention them in dialogue the next time you play. And you really felt like you were living in the same town/area. You'd be excited to see the what changes they made next or upset that they beat you to it. But hey, that's life. Well now that 2nd, 3rd, 4th player cant progress the story, or help new residents move in. Some DIY creations are kept from them. And it downright sucks to be that person. Multiplayer is a huge part of this game which is why I'm giving it a 6 star. Last quick bit on their online play: it is okay. At least each person will get their own screen there. But it's not optimized and obviously hasn't gone through any QA testing.

Animal Crossing is one of my favorite games so this is why I'm taking the time to write this review. Ultimately my personal thought is they royally messed up this game by not putting really any more than an ounce of thought into the multiplayer aspect. But again the series is great, the concept is great. Ultimately they added some interesting content to the game now. I'm excited to see what they add in future updates! Edit: P.S. Sadly the local multiplayer issues are enough to where I had to tell my brother to return the game. As he was hoping he'd be able to play it with his wife.

My family has one switch, three people, no problems with any other game, but the thing is if one person completes something neither of the other two get to experience it at all.

Yes , the game is beautiful. Yes, the characters are adorable. Yes, it's great to customize your character the way you want without going to the hairdresser's. Yes, it's awesome to put furnitures everywhere in your island.

But what I HATE and strongly prevents me from enjoying the game is :
- crafting permanently your tools because they always break after only a few uses : even the iron tools end up shattering really quick !
- crafting items and collecting D.I.Y cards : I hate to go farming for iron, stones and especially wood !
- the tarentulas, even if, apparently, they're a really good thing because they're worth a lot of money !
- the wasps, especially when you use an axe with trees !
- paying real life money for the online multiplayer feature !
- paying real life money to transfer patterns !
- no swimsuit !
- the Photopia island is useless !
- Finding Gulliver's circuits on the beach ? No way ! I loved his little guessing game in ""New Leaf"".
- the Easter even is really painful because those eggs often replace fish : I don't want to fish for eggs, but for fish !

I went to buy 2 copies of Animal Crossing today and thankfully the store attendant said ‘You do know you can only have 1 island per Switch’ I’m hazarding a guess they may have had few games returned already!
I said that’s fine I have 2 switches because I have 3 children and we like to cross play on games. Then it dawned on me. I could create an island for me on my switch but who would get to create their island on the other Switch?
Draw lots? Choose a favourite child?!

Anyway the only choice I was left with was to return both the games as it really would have caused big arguments.

So from us that has been a big fail regarding sales and I am not being bitter in saying I hope this doesn’t work out for them and they patch it.

SimQueen,06-04-2020,This game is probably fantastic but I cannot play it in anyway it’s truly meant to be because they only allow one person per console to play the game. I don’t care that one island. Can support 8 players because there is only one person able to do anything fun. They rest are just sentient NPCs. It’s unfair and unjustifiable. It’s completely unrealistic to expect families to spend a minimum of 270 dollars for every person who wants to play this game the way it should be played. No other games have this restriction meaning this was done intentionally to drag more money out of already paying customer. Ridiculous. Big fail on Nintendo’s side.,0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Utilize it's potential and make separate islands we can all have freedom to make our own decisions on. If you want to stick to the one island, make it so each island is linked to each other (separated by rivers, and later accessable using bridges).

I don't mind the progression, though; as a parent I only have limited time to play it anyway. My main gripe is the same as everyone else reviewing this game poorly - the decision to lock each Switch to one island. Previous games may have done this, but save files were treated differently when they were stored on cartridges; this was a design choice.

When I played the original game, I remember another family member and I were both able to play and have fun. Reading about the functionality for multiple players now, though, I don't feel like it's even worth inviting someone else to play. It seems like a lot of features, even beyond being able to place buildings and such (which it makes sense to restrict to one person), are missing for succeeding players.

Yes the game is slow but it is nowhere near boring, you always have an objective to do like paying off your mortgage, inviting new neighbors, etc. This game is mean't to be play like when walk through a park or go on a hike, it's not explosive excitement but it is really relaxing and satisfying. upgrading your house and finishing a section in the museum is incredibly rewarding. In fact have one island per switch is the best part, I have 3 other people on the same island and it is nowhere near crowded. having 3 of my siblings makes it feel more like home, being able to trade and help the rest of my family makes the game even more personal. it even got my mom interested interested in video games and overall has helped my family grow closer.

Lifeisbellablog,02-05-2020,"This may not be the most complex game, but something about it is undeniably charming and addictive. The little animal villagers are extremely adorable and its very wholesome building friendships with them.

There are some problems with the game that are complete dealbreakers for people though, like only having one game per console. Luckily that doesn't really affect me, or I would have had a real problem with this game. It would also be good if you could play couch co-op with full functionality for the second player. The second player can't really do much. There are also some problems that should be fixed such as being able to craft multiple things at once. I think there are also some kinks to be worked out with kicking villagers out. There are 3 villagers that I want OUT and I haven't talked to them for a month, and they still won't leave. The only ones that ask to leave are ones that I actually like. So that's just been pretty annoying for me. I also feel like there are several things that could have been added that would have made the game more rewarding in my opinion. I wish there was some factor of skill points that show your fishing experience level, or your friendship level with a villager. This may be getting a little too complicated though, but it's just my preference. Another thing is it's very rare that the villagers or Tom Nook actually asks you to complete any activities such as fetch this specific bug, or make this furniture. This feels like a completely missed opportunity to fulfill requests for the villagers. (I know this is something that is a feature in the game, but for some reason in my experience this opportunity rarely ever pops up). I do wish there were a more things to do in the vein of quests, but I think the seasonal events will keep things interesting for the foreseeable future.

It's easy for me to point out all of the faults I have with this game but it's hard to explain why I still love it despite all its faults. It has it's problems, and on paper isn't much to do, but there's just something about it. Overall, it's a very slow burn but it is satisfying to see your island develop from nothing and to your own ideal island aesthetic and friendships. The game has it's problems, but it's easy to overlook them because of how charming and addictive it is.

It's still a beautiful game, don't get me wrong. But within a month even without Time Travelling I've nearly completed the museum and have already gotten close to receiving golden tool DIY Recipes.
If Nintendo added the dream suite and club tortimer back with its public island as well as a lot of the other features they added in the previous instalment then I would be rating this way higher.
But so far it just seems like the game is a carbon copy of the previous games before New Leaf that's even been dumbed down by just giving a crafting option to make it seem as if the game is giving you "" MORE THINGS TO DO "", when in reality you're really just repeating the same stuff over and over and over again tediously.

spiritcode55,22-04-2020,"By far the best in the Animal Crossing/Forest series. It does lack stuff to do at about two weeks in, after a certain event, that somewhat signifies the end of the ""tutorial"" if you could really call it that. But after that you'll soon learn that in Animal Crossing, there is always something to do! The ""Nook Miles"" are a great addition, giving you something to do even when you are done with your daily ""chores"", which only consist of the usual Animal Crossing activities such as fishing and catching bugs, doing favors etc. It should also be noted that the game improves upon New Leaf in a variety of ways. For instance the sound design is spectacular! One of the best sounding games on the Switch system, if not the best overall. There are some things however that are cause for controversy, such as the local multiplayer issue, in which the ""leader"" is pretty much the only one who gets to do anything, while any one else can collect materials, they go to the recycling bin in the resident services tent/building, which is fine till you realize that anyone can access that, and take the other players stuff, and to top it off the second player can't take it till either they are the leader, or they boot up the game by themselves. Another setback is the exclusion of cloud saves/backups. While Nintendo has stated that there will be a way to get your island back in the case of console loss or theft, it has not to my knowledge been implemented yet. So basically for now say your console got stolen, you would lose all of your progress, and as someone who has accidentally lost their save game, it is not a great time building back up what you lost. So, in conclusion the game is sub-par... just kidding this is the best selling Animal Crossing for a reason, if you have the means to purchase this game DO, you will not regret it, just keep in mind some of the disappointing aspects of the game, and try to keep your console itself safe! I know that times are rough right now, so I just wanted to say to any one who actually reads this, if you can't afford the game do NOT go out of your way to buy it, save your money for food and other living costs!

FrustratedUser,26-04-2020,"RE: One Single Island Per Console, Shared by all users.

It is incredibly frustrating that the game is only One-Island-Per-Console. My wife and I have different users and NSO sign-ins, and it sucks that we can't each have our own island short of buying two Nintendo Switches (difficult with COVID) and two copies of the game.

Why on earth would Nintendo go out of their way to make this unlike almost every other game and application ever written that respects multiple users. It is bad enough each user can only have one Island/World/Profile, but to force other users to share them is really really dumb. Like to the point my wife doesn't even want to play a game I'm pretty sure she'd love.

Anybody who has ever had to share a console knows that this sucks. Anyone with siblings over 30 knows how bad it sucks when someone screws with your save-data-slot. There isn't only 128K free for save data. The files cannot be that big. There is no good reason for this.

While the game is wonderful otherwise, this is a glaring, absolute foundational defect that completely ruins the gameplay and usability.

The game is beautiful. The water is s t u n n i n g. The attention to detail is amazing. It's everything.

Game play is what you'd expect of an Animal Crossing game. Terraforming and crafting are intense. The control given to you literally makes you a god among animals.

It is a little concerning that there are a lot less features than what we had in base game New Leaf, but the updates will happen and give us a lot more content. If you play this game the way it's intended to be played, it won't slow down. However, since we're all in corona time and going crazy, you might get tired.

Nintendo has made some baffling choices that they're failing to fix that understandably can break this game for many. One island per console that is basically permanently tied to the console is a huge step back.

Additionally, minor quality of life changes can also help tremendously, like bulk crafting, dropping multiple items at once, giving more pattern spaces, and cutting extra dialogue we've seen a hundred times (you have to press A on CJ like 40 times each run in the fishing tourney)",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Fritoe,29-04-2020,"I'm going to start this review by saying Animal Crossing New Horizons is the best entry in the series. There is no doubt in my mind. The creativity and attention to detail that was put in by the developers is nothing short than inspiring. There is a part of me that is genuinely concerned for the future of the series, not for anything bad for the game, but for how much it has to offer. Where else can they go? The next installment is going to be something I'm afraid of. They might not even come out with one and just update this gem of creativity. I'm afraid I'm not explaining enough, but what I mean is that from each iteration we gain a new customizable feature. From being from a standard town, then to a bigger place with friends being able to visit, then to an even bigger place that has a city element, to being a mayor able to change layouts and buildings and now to a ""god"" as the community jokes about being able to shift the land itself. Hopefully, that explains my concern about the future of this game, where next? This definitely is, in my eyes, the ultimate animal crossing game and has provided millions of people including myself, hours upon hours of relaxing release. As I cross the 350-hour mark, I think its time for me to explain how I felt about the game. As the beginning is slow and may take a lot of time to start feeling like the traditional animal crossing everyone knows, you start understanding how the game is trying to teach you the fundamentals of the new mechanics introduced. It can be frustrating at first if you're the impatient type, but it is well understood the more you play. That's what makes all these negative comments so surprising to read for me. I never have written a review to anything other than amazon products and maybe a youtube comment if you consider that a review of some sorts. I even made an account to just write about this topic. Yes, the game is limited to one island per person. Do not go into this game expecting to have the experience of a maximum of 8 islands on your system. This is apparently is a reason for people to be giving the game a 0 on this site and others as well. Not about the gameplay, or what a good/bad game it is, or even how slow it takes to start as I thought the negative reviews would be about. No, it's about how f you have more than one account on your switch, the others won't be allowed to terraform the island. I cannot think of anyone who would od this other than children or people who are playing Animal crossing for the first time. I don't mean any of those remarks as insults, and I will explain. New leaf, the last game in the series before New Horizons. One player was the mayor, and that's it. Anyone else playing on your 3DS won't have access to those features. If the reasons for that aren't apparent to you, then you don't understand how basic computing and video games work and that's okay. It's okay to not understand something, that's why you should seek the information that you don't understand. Just think about how much memory it would take for the switch to have a maximum of 8 islands with all unique layouts, villagers, and all the other features that make this game the masterpiece that it is. That's not possible to fit on the system itself, therefore it's not a reality. It wasn't for the 3DS, so why is it a problem all a sudden? That's when kids come into the picture. Parents will usually buy one system for the house and each kid wants to have their own island which I completely understand as I would as well as a child. However, does that inherently make it a bad game? Of course not. I have another family member on my island who doesn't have terraforming access as they are the second player to move in. When they want to change something about the island they do one of the possible two things. They either ask me to change it for them, or they log in as me and do it themselves. Oh yeah, did I mention the ability to switch accounts on the switch is Minimalistically seamless? It takes less than 5 seconds to change profiles and start a game. It's fine to criticize a game, but it's downright insane to mass bad review a game for system limitations when the problem has nothing to do with the gameplay its self. If I'm the wrong one for feeling this way then so be it, I'll stand alone. Is Nintendo just doing this to sell more consoles? Most definitely not, however, I don't think they are complaining that this is an ""issue"". Then that gets into the problem of how the bad reviews may affect Nintendo, but it hurts the animal crossing franchise more. People will see the negative source for consumers and assume it's just another game that critics love and the public didn't, further greatening the divide between creators and fans. I really don't know what to say at this point other than how disappointing it is to see the gaming culture turn into this immaturity and not appreciate the art that countless artists spent years creating.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
ekixbrass,29-04-2020,"This is my first time playing Animal Crossing, and it is very addicting! Very fun to play and there is always something to do. I understand why people are upset about the one island per console, but they shouldn't give this game a low rating because of it. The graphics are amazing and the animations are cute, but something I hate is that the tools always break.. it ruins the fun and I have to go build new tools which isn't relaxing at all. But overall, the game is amazing to play especially during this pandemic, it takes your mind off of things. If you're not sure whether or not to get this game, I was once in your shoes, and I bought the game because all of my friends had it. Now I absolutely love the game.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

nightstroller,30-04-2020,"To be super honest without even considering the one-character restriction, this game is overhyped. Yes the atmosphere is relaxing and the graphics are cute, but this game for some reason doesn't really make me want to binge play it. Maybe it was designed like that on purpose, with rocks and resources spawning daily once tapped. But overall, this isn't a game I would stay up playing. Not to say it's bad or boring, just not so great in my eyes.

Big freaking whoop. The leader is then left with all the grind. Having to collect so many resources and get out of so much island debt leaves the leader unable to pursue their own ambitions. This game is so lifelike in a bad way that it leaves me dreading it like i dread my real mortgage. Nintendo will not likely fix or patch or update this, don't hold your breath.

There are many key things that I think people really click with in this game. The villagers, who all have a unique look and vibe to them, the clothing is amazing, with hundreds of clothing items to buy, you'll have a hard time finding just one perfect outfit, the island terraforming is a breath of fresh air to the series and is done in a simple and non complicated way. Nothing in this game feels off or out of theme. The difficulty curve is small, but part of the fun is learning along the way. The online play is really good, there are some things to fix, but for what it is, I think it's really nice.

Belgarion321,25-05-2020,"Well, as an Animal Crossing fan since Wild World times, I must say this last installment is quite the pinnacle for the saga. It is quite complete, from my opinion, and though it is not a revolutionary game for the saga, it evolves every game mechanic and adds a lot of new features. The personalisation introduced in New Leaf goes into a new level, with the option of building your island from scratch, placing furniture outside the house, the paths... For the fans, all of these are great news. The Nook Miles system, although I do not personally see it as ""bad"", I found it a bit tedious (from a very personal point of view), but it helps to try to have like a daily routine in our island. You can spend hours and hours without notice, and that is a very positive thing to say.

About negative points, I must say I have little complains about this game. Maybe there are too few shops (compared to New Leaf) and the fact that we can only play the events (Easter, Nature Day...) during the real days (and after the final day, if time travel back, they are not activated again) are my main complains. And about the great amount of zeros due to 1 island per console, although is a thing that can prevent someone from not giving this game a 10 (I include myself in this group), I think it is too exaggerated to rate it a zero. And with the fact that most of the users rating this game a zero are users which only rate has been this game, I think Metacritic should act and help to give this game a rate which really deserves (nor a 5.2, either a 10, possibly a 8.5-9).

Neither my girlfriend nor I play anymore because we both wanted our own experience so we are arguing over every change. If we each had our own island this would be fixed in an instant.

JennX,31-05-2020,I suppose it's a great solo game but if you are more than 1 people with 1 console it's unplayable. The first one to play take the resources to craft a couple of tools and the other player doesn't have resouces to do anything. You have to wait 24 hours for the resources to respawn To be able to play if you are 3 players you have to play 1 day on 3 to let everyone grab their resources.

Doovde,20-03-2020,"A fantastic little game that will eat up your spare time. Whether it be decorating your home, growing and tending your garden, socialising, adventuring, shopping, teraforming the landscape, crafting or interacting with the wildlife, Animal Crossing has something for everyone.

The game works in real time so times of days, seasons, deliveries, and events change depending on what's happening in the real world. This creates a slower paced game and allows you as a player to take your time and let your little island grow organically with every decision you make. There are some complaining about island sharing with others on the same console but the fact is it makes the game better. Islands are sizable so there is plenty of space for everyone but most importantly this is a social game and multiple residents makes it easier to harvest and share resources which is ESSENTIAL to progression. All in all a wonderful game and highly recommended.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Nintendo has said before that they wanted everyone in a household to have their own switch and it looks like this is one of the many ways they plan on doing it. All under the guise of ""to prevent cheating"" even though the main way people cheat is changing the internal clock on their system and they're already doing it.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

xlenny,22-03-2020,"I have to rate this game a 0 like many others have said for the same reason is you cannot have more than one island per switch. The local multiplayer is a joke. The first person that does the tasks, gets the rewards and everyone else don't get share that joy. If you can have 4 people on an island on local coop and 8 people with online multiplayer visit your island. There is no reason why this game cannot be patched to give the same experience to everyone.

its the same story as others have mentioned already.

Nintendo the year is 2020 not 1985. Multiple game saves do exist. The Nintendo Switch do have on board memory and a SD card slot for extra storage. No worries it can handle it!

Nintendo have designed Animal crossing this way. They did this on purpose to force people to buy hardware and a second copy of the game. shameful. Other than that is is a great game, too bad its not equal for everyone.

Here's how the game should work with a single switch : Johnny signs in with his Nintendo profile, Plays Animal Crossing, does his tasks and game progression. once done Jane signs in with her profile, Plays Animal Crossing, does her tasks and game progression.

Want to play on the same island together? no problem, Choose which Island you want to play on and when the 2nd player visits they can take some resources with them to share. Both can continue to play together and farm resources that they can keep or trade. Sounds simple, but Nintendo don't want it that way.

Bottom Line is : To truly enjoy this game multiplayer you need two Nintendo Switches and two copies of the game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

And27,24-03-2020,"Made an account just to review this game to help raise awarness and hopefully get this fixed. The reason I say ""fixed"" is because it is unbelievable that this was the intention of the developers and Nintendo. The game is great as a single player experience, even sitting around watching my girlfriend play is a fun time and helping her out by grabbing the controller to help her progress.Everything changes though when you want to try having your own animal crossing experience on your account. The game locks you into one island per switch, so whatever creative descisions the first player made is stripped from the second player.You cannot place buildings or structures, donate to the museum, or unlock more DIY tools or construction kits. You are locked by the progress of the first player, even though you are on a completely different profile. The only way out of this is to give Nintendo more money by purchasing a new Switch console. Yes thats right, want the full experience of this game for yourself but can't because someone started playing the game on the Switch first, for the mere price of a whole new console you can have that $60 on release game experience for only about 5x the cost of the game originally, thanks Nintendo, you have basically locked the gane into being a hard 1 game per console and advertising it as a fun multiplayer experience where everyone gets to help make an island together. Instead you have that experience for only one player and all the other accounts on your console are just along for the ride. No one should have to suffer a paywall this high, poor business practices and this game deserves every negative rating it gets until this is fixed. 0/10 a masterpiece only 1 person in your household can enjoy.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Yogi77,26-03-2020,"This game is great, I’d give it a 9/10. Gave it a 10 for the nonsensical people ever thinking this was a true multiplayer experience. It’s literally the only complaint about the game and people are giving it zero’s. One ridiculous comment I saw “Switch is a family-friendly console, this is not a family-friendly game. Instant zero.” The game doesn’t even let you name your character something obscene. You can report COMPUTER NPCs for being semi-inappropriate. How is it not family-friendly? Have y’all never played the game before? It’s a SINGLE-PLAYER LIFE SIM. It always has been and it always will be. The fact you can go visit others’ islands in itself is a huge victory. I’m really enjoying this game. The crafting is great, the tiered crafting is pretty cool too. The museum looks amazing compared to past games and I want to catch EVERYTHING! Nook miles are an interesting add, weird, but nothing too essential has been sold there thus far, and what has I’ve been easily able to get the miles for. Heck, I had over 10,000 miles within a few hours and I was playing leisurely (as it’s meant to be played).

I forgot the thing runs in real time, so it forces you to take breaks unless gathering and crafting and selling are your cup o’ tea. Other games call in the meantime. Great experience thus far about 15-20 hours (play time) in. Again, if you bought this and expected it to be a full multiplayer experience, you clearly didn’t know enough about the game and shouldn’t have bought it. Your fault. End of story. I recommend everyone check this amazing game out. Hundreds of hours of entertainment.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
theateremagine,24-03-2020,The fact that I cannot buy two different games at least to have a different island than the rest of my family is ridiculous. I wouldn’t mind sharing if it wasn’t so Only the First Player gets to upgrade things. It’s disgusting because I’ve been sitting with an underdeveloped island for days while my younger sibling got the favoritism of my parents so they were allowed to make the first character and now the villagers have been in tents for 5 days!!! All because they don’t want to play as often as they acted like they would. So now I’m stuck on an island with no stores because the First Relocater hasn’t supplied building materials. I’m about to lose my MIND. For the love of GOD at least change it so if I throw money at Nintendo and buy another copy of the game I can have a new island!!!!,0,ACNH,METACRITIC

FavorableGamer,20-03-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons was one of the best first-party games exclusively published by Nintendo. Packed with new and interesting content, it is something worthwhile for individuals looking forward playing the next series of Animal Crossing. Recently, they showcased so much information on Animal Crossing Direct, and there were exciting things we can do. For instance, the ability of being able to terraform and waterscape the land, achievements, 8 players online, customizations, and so on. While playing it, one of the honorable mentions was the writing itself, which may be referred to as the character’s dialog. Because they were willing to add variety of words when they talk, it seems enjoyable and natural to go talk with different characters in the game. However, there are downsides. You might have only one island per console, which means you cannot have multiple islands in the game. Besides, the incapable of not supporting cloud-saves. It needs to be supported, so people won’t get their internal data lost. Although, the game fully meets expectations with a good gameplay in which it is intended for hardcore audiences. At last, this is beyond the next level of Animal Crossing game, and a must-buy title in 2020.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

It doesn't mather - you are forced to watch same freaking animation ""yes, I catched it, wow!"". Would you like to sell something? It's good but everytime you are forced to read the same text all over again. It's going to be like 1000 times throughout whole game.

It looks horrific, ultra low quality and of course 1080p. The Switch itself is a nightmare to use, max 5mbps downloads bad connections etc. Multiplayer is done horrific, takes forever to play with someone and when you do you wonder why? There is nothing to do, just a slow and boring nerd game. So sad I wasted 400euro on a console that performs worse than an iPhone and with barely any games on it.

Edit update: I sold the switch for 430eur so no loss. The game is SEVERELY limited and bottle necked by the Switch's terrible hardware. Load screens inside load screens lmfao. Got a new room in your house? Nice load screen, so sad. Hit boxes are so huge you feel like playing Minecraft. Place a lamp and you can't walk around for 1 meter lol...

Evil_Pasta,25-03-2020,"Truly a great game.

With a terrible local multiplayer system... For a console like a Switch...

Well, not exactly The ""Multiplayer""...
Look
You have an island. One per console. For all five possible accounts.

Just one island. This means that daily resources (from rocks and trees, and some plants) are limited either for just one player or split between all players.

But that's not everything. The only person that can actually progress the whole island further is the first player, the one that created the island. Other players depend on him. (Imagine having no idea about that, and letting a 6-year-old kid play it first) (Not my problem, thankfully)

Not only progress, even managing the island is the privilege of the primary player.

Alright. So if this game is designed this way, maybe players are supposed to play together?-
-Hah, of course not! First of all - no split-screen. Second of all, everything depends on the group leader. Secondary players can only run around him, do some stuff, but their inventory is non-existent until they get the leadership (meanwhile everything they got as secondary players gets stuck in a limited-size box owned by the player who was a group leader)

...
Have I told you the story of how I ruined the first impression for my older brother, who technically was the first player, but I was the first to actually play the game once the island was created, and I was the one to collect all the available resources...

//Yeah, I was wondering, why couldn't I progress any further for the last couple of days. So I made quick research... Turns out that's why our experience was so much worse than it should have been//

...Game is good, I agree on that part. But there is one problem. Because I and my brother share one Switch, neither I nor he can enjoy it entirely. And after some time we will get to a point, where I'm not getting all of the content the game has just because I am a secondary player.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

This game lives up to the hype for this long time Animal Crossing fan. The co-op experience reminds me of the good ol' DS days. I haven't gotten too far into it yet, but I am already addicted and see myself coming back to the island every day, even if it is for a short amount of time. Also, I am the only person on my console playing this game, and I don't time skip because I am a patient person along for the experience. Thank you Nintendo, sorry people are review bombing your game because they clearly didn't watch all of the videos you put forth in preparation for the game.
Update 4/4/2020: This game has officially consumed my life. With the coronavirus bs going on and everything closing, this allows me to ""hang out"" with friends and family. It scratches the itch for social interaction, and I literally cannot stop playing this. Soooo much customization, you can literally recreate your entire island.

Pmango0312,20-03-2020,"People, stop freaking out about the whole 1 town, 1 switch thing. Honestly, you probably have two switches/ switch lites if you really want to play with anyone in your family. Everyone is just looking at the game’s one multiplayer flaw and immediately giving it a zero. No one is looking at the game by itself, and I see a extremely polished Animal crossing game that me and my brother are having a blast with. There are some quality of life issues, for example selling stuff doesn’t let you select multiple items to sell at a time( same with buying), but those can be easily overlooked. It’s probably one of the best looking switch games, and the music is phenomenal! Definitely a game you can really sink your teeth in until Nintendo eventually gives us another great game to play. I haven’t gotten to try out the online yet, but it does look really fun going to your friends islands and helping them too.

LoneWolf04,06-04-2020,"There are some basic things that should be in the game that aren’t and make things extremely frustrating while playing and customizing your island.

When placing buildings you can “preview” where the building is going but only in your limited field of view. No overhead map to line object up to get an overall perspective. Even though you get this high point of view when a visitor flies to your island. Hell even grids to line things up would be helpful, since they show grids for the plot on the building being placed but nothing around it.

When paying to move a building. If you’re only trying to move a building several spaces to line buildings up, you can’t! Forces you to move it once out of the way and then back again.

With the amount of switch shortages across the world and limiting one island per switch makes no sense. Complete greed and not consumer friendly. Even to limit you being able to move your island transfer to another switch is complete opposite of consumer friendly. I have an OG switch and want to upgrade to a new V2 switch and there has not been a good resolution without jumping through hoops and praying I that I will be able to do so.

Not even 2 weeks into the game release and the update has replaced half your resources you normally farm with “special bunny day eggs” along with an ungodly amount of recipes for the event. It appears several updates to try and help the situation have been released, but still problem-some. This is a prime example of “always-connected” games gone wrong.

Let’s talk about item storage. Why is there not a chest to craft to place outside your home to hold normal items like wood and minerals for crafting? No, I have to go inside my house, wait for a load screen, pick items from storage, craft with an inside crafting table, put things away and then back outside to wait on another load screen. So if an item broke and you didn’t have the resource on you to craft, whatever you were hoping to get will despawn while forced to go in to get items to craft. This is especially painful early on in the game with limited on character storage space.

Now onto the crafting mechanic. If I’m trying to craft multiples of the same item and have the resources to do so, why do I have to go through multiple screens and animations to craft the same item over and over? Talk about time waster.

One last complaint. I had a visitor come to my a campsite. Not a visitor I wanted, but chatted with them to see what they had to say. My only 2 responses were to offer them a house only island. Could not refuse them coming. Only good news is by a quick search result that I can kick them off later after move in and several days.

Don’t get me wrong, the game is fun and offers a lot, but can still be drastically improved on function. Expect a lot of clunky and repetitive animations and not any type fluid gameplay. The game is good by offering things to come back daily and check on resources. But, a lot of free to play games do the same with the same clunky gameplay mechanics. Publisher stepped up the graphics moving from 3DS to switch, but fluid gameplay is lacking for basic mechanics and to keep the game moving forward. The idea of less loading screens to keep the player immersed is something other companies are doing well. This game is lacking that in some key areas as described.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

rickycarrillo,24-03-2020,"To say that co-op is terrible, or that the game isn't fair, simply means that you're not putting in the effort to enjoy the game. Player 2, if you are coming into the game expecting that you'll be able to do so so much, you wont. Just like player 1, they had to slowly and painstakingly put time into the game to get to the points you're complaining about.

I understand the one island per switch, but there's two reasons for this.
First, an island takes up a significant amount of space on your switch. With the addition of progression and adding items to your inventory, and your museum and encyclopedia, that all adds up. Then imagine every user on a switch, 8 users with their own individual islands, on top of that per user, 7 additional houses per shared island. That's a grand total of 8 unique islands, and 64 unique players. That amount of data adds up, quickly.

Secondly, adding onto the data situation. The game allows 8 users total on an island. If you're playing online, the max is 8 on your island total. Given the switch has a total of 8 users, its the best choice to make. One island per switch, one player per user.

To review bomb a game means you aren't taking time to understand and come to terms why the game is built like this.

DukeJon,11-04-2020,"The other user reviews are correct; the insane design decision of having one island per switch has effectively killed multiplayer for this game. You simply feel like a guest on someone else's island, and if the player who registered the island stops playing all gameplay progression comes grinding to a halt, potentially causing you to lose many hours of work. In addition to that I found single player rather pointless and cumbersome. Selecting tools, crafting, managing your inventory are all much more of a chore than they should be. The NPC's are all very boring, just wandering around all day and coming out with the same stock answers. Crafting your own furniture and items is pointless if you can't actually interact with them. What's the point of crafting a musical instrument if you can't use it? Why bother with a mirror if you can't see your reflection? Instead you just spend your time gathering resources. It's not that I dislike games of this genre, per se, but with Animal crossing you start off on such a tiny island with so little to do that's interesting I am really struggling to see why there are so many glowing reviews.

You can tell the developers put in a lot of time and effort and they still come out with major free updates. I think a lot of developers could learn from this like game freak by allowing free updates that improve the game over time instead of dlc that costs 30 dollars for assets that should have been in the base game. Kinda going off on Pokémon so I’ll get back to animal crossing. I love all of the new characters and improved quality of life additions.

There is no strong narrative, but that's standard for AC games. Graphics are amazing, and the island feels much more alive compared to previous games.

I know there's been a lot of criticism of only one island per console, but I honestly LOVE the concept of sharing an island on the console. It makes the island feel more alive and is true to real life, that you're not the only one in the world.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Interruptor,12-04-2020,"I've decided to give it a really low score as I've paid full price for this overhyped mobile game and we've pretty much stopped playing it in the house. Even my 6 year old who is the main player (I also didn't even imagine a developer would do something like this so I let her have a go first) has stopped playing after spending days collecting eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs and eggs.

1) Only one island per console
2) The first player is the only one, yada, yada, you know where this goes...
3) The island is tiny! There is hardly anything to see or do! It's so full I'll looks like a Wii menu or lobby for a larger game. This is no BOTW I'm telling you!
4) The camera is something out of the 90s! You can't see what your doing if you're behind an object. It's infuriating!
5) Tasks are boring and repetitive. Find wood. Sell. Catch shells. Sell. Pay mortgage. Repeat. Jesus it's dull! Oh wait! A new fish species for the museum!... Oh, it's not, it's an…

But my personal score is 5/10.

Why? Well because my wife landed on the island first. And now im living on my wifes island. Thats right. This is NOT our island. Second player have NO rights. He can just run around, gather stuff, catch fishes, sometimes help the first player collecting resources for new buildings. Is it interesting for the second player? I dont think so. The progress of the second player fully depends from the first player. This is a HUGE disapointment.

Giblets,25-03-2020,"Fun game. Highly polished single-player experience. However, the multiplayer/single island per console has soured my feelings about the game.

The game experience for the second resident (P2) is considerably different and IMO lesser than that of the ""island representative"" (P1). As P2 I have very little control or influence over what is built in the town and where. I cannot contribute directly to town projects with my resources. I am prevented from unlocking certain recipes. I am prevented from using certain tools until P1 unlocks them as part of the story.

The only way for multiple players to get the full experience of building and refining their own island is to buy multiple consoles. I don't interpret this as malice/greed so much as an oversight. What works for a handheld does not necessarily work for a home console like the switch.

As it stands I recommend the game for single players, but I cannot fully recommend the game to anyone sharing a console.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

Ascathar,27-03-2020,"I made a metacritic account specifically for this review. This is not a review-bomb, this score actively reflects the amount of joyment I got out of this game keeping in mind the following things:

1: The 60 dollar price tag
2: The Islands limitations
3: The gameplay itself

The game itself looks beautiful, and the core gameplay loop is a lot of fun. This gameplay loop is relatively unaltered for a second player who has to reside on the same island as the first. However, any meaningful progress, and thus reasons to boot up the game at all, has been stripped away for a second (or more) player.
Being player 2(+) means you can not make progress towards the museum (and thus catching different bugs and fish is moot), it means you can not interact with villagers in the same way (and thus always have to resort to buying every item from the store, instead of being able to find the recipes through the story), and generally means you are living the life of an NPC on player 1s island.

Being player 1, on the other hand, provides a well-polished and extremely rich game, fully worthy of a score around 9/10. It's a unique life simulator, where everything you accomplishes gives you no small amount of joy.

In other words, this game is a gem, where one meaningful design flaw ruins the experience for hundreds of thousands of players (which I doubt is an exaggeration).

I am contributing my own review in the hopes of any sort of change coming to this current setup.

I am fully aware that having multiple islands per Switch is unrealistic, and would also detract from the premise of the game, but I do feel it should be possible for active players to have the same sense of wonder and explorations. Make npc's give player 2(+) the same items, allow player 2(+) to submit their captures to the museum, and allow them to contribute to the building of other items. I understand that the general lay-out of a town can be determined by one person, but that doesn't mean every fun element of the game has to be stripped away.

Thank you for coming to my Ted-Talk.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
AzilTheRatonga,27-03-2020,"So, I'm not going to review bomb the game like everyone else is. I actually do like this game and see it as a pretty okay game, not the best, not the worst. It's got wonderful fun and interesting villagers, and the game's great for when you just want to sit back and relax while the whole world burns from all the crazy **** going on but... here are my main issues with the game:

-Island limitation, being restricted to one island per console is kind of a dick move in my opinion especially when I cannot do anything other than upgrade my house because I let my boyfriend make his character/island first. the Nintendo Switch is expensive as all hell, no one's going to buy a second Switch just because of that unless they're rich.

-Controls. The controls are just.. awful, and apparently it's always been like this according to my boyfriend. I feel like with this being a new game, you guys could have fixed the controls so it's not a pain in the ass to whack a rock with a shovel, dig things up, capture bugs or chop down trees. You have no excuse to keep the controls the same as previous titles.

-Story progression limitation, as mentioned with Island limitation, you, as the secondary player, cannot do **** meaning only the first character can do the story while you just sit there doing nothing other than upgrading your own house...so you end up having to wait until the the first player does things to do stuff. It really ruins the experience for everyone involved.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

This would all be forgivable and even acceptable if you were able to have more than one island per game. With more than one active user the game grinds to an annoying halt. With the constant need to switch between accounts to share quest details. Yes, for some reason a second user has no ability to see details of the latest mission set by Tom Nook. More than that, some quests follow an all or nothing approach. So if you collect 15 iron and your wife, sibling or roommate has 15, you can't share in the glory.

Oil_Oil,31-03-2020,"I just want to preface this with, I am fine with the one island per console restrictions! I think it's a bit of an ea move but I truly am okay with it and I'm well aware it was properly disclosed to potential buyers early in development. What seems absolutely ridiculous is that really only one player is truly playing the game they payed for, while everyone else is stuck being a glorified villager who can upgrade their house. There aren't even ways to get recipes for certain furniture because there is no access to the story or even simple town upgrades like bridges and inclines if you aren't player one! This is ridiculous and Nintendo knows it, especially because these restrictions are not something Nintendo was upfront about because they knew it would hurt game sales. The absolute lack of care for it's customers in this regard is just not something I had come to expect from Nintendo and I am shocked and appaled. I payed for the game too and every player on the system should be able to play regardless of whether everyone is on the same island or not. Either make all players equal or give everyone their own island... because what we have at current is a game thats only fit to be played by player one. While I do understand that Nintendo is attempting to sell more consoles (though that's not even possible at this time due to them being sold out nearly everywhere) they are also selling a product, Animal Crossing is a product that people payed $60 and it CAN be held to the standard that every player in the game can actually... you know... play. Nintendo not being upfront about the fact that it is essentially a game only able to be played by one person oer console turns animal crossing into a **** product for everyone who shares a switch, which might I add with it's multiple accounts per console, was marketed as a sharable family console when it first came out, not something like a ds that everyone was meamt to have their own... I'm just going to be honest, if you share a switch don't get the game, not until something changes. Either you'll be the resident representative and you're family or partner will be stuck being upset amd probably a bit resentful (Ive been in and heard of plenty of fights breaking out over this game in families) or you'll be the second player and will find your gameplay so limited you'd be just as well off playing the free mobile game pocket camp. If you have your own switch, great, good for you, get the game I'm sure its a blast, if not, maybe get an older edition of the game or wait until its possible to buy another console, or play a game like stardew with a similar vibe to animal crossing.

Naroyto,03-04-2020,"Where do I begin, no this isn't your regular blind rant of someone complaining about, one switch one island. I'm here to educate you why I chose to give this sorry installment they would like to call New horizons this score. Allow me to elaborate first and foremost this is an excellent single player game. To call it multiplayer would mean you have some sort of undying fanboy inside you telling you that it is. After many iteration this latest installment offers NOTHING and I mean ZERO new concepts, ideas or features involving multiplayer game play. That is what makes this such a lackluster game. I mean you go to a town and then what? Nothing absolutely nothing especially those posh elites thinking that you must do nothing to change a town or even run because it wears out the grass. Why have them over then? To show off your island that was obtained obviously by means of time travel and you have the audacity to set rules on your throne of lies? Seriously if you time travel you are only cheating yourself of the true experience of the game which is to grind and work hard for your accomplishments and should think twice about posting your ""perfect"" town for fake internet points. With nothing to penalize time traveler they just ruin the point of the game and finish it within a week. This game offers nothing new compared to the older games in fact the museum received an overhaul on its interior yet there is less to fill it with. Yes that's right because there are no paintings and no deep sea creatures to turn in.

Another thing about that. There is still no new additions to the bug, fish and fossils list and that's shameful just going to find the same ones over again with nothing new to find.

The crafting system was the most exciting thing I wanted. Until the gimic ran out faster than starting tools could last. Seriously it became more of a chore than a fun feature. There's no insensitive to get better gear if the cheapest one does the same job as a golden version of the tool. And on that note how about you explain why golden tools break? They are not supposed to break they are a symbol of one's accomplishments to obtain them and should not be reduced to the games gimic.

Don't get me started with the island tour nonsense. And I paraphrase ""each island you go to will never be the same as the last so make sure you do everything you can before you leave because we won't be coming back ever"" yet, there are countless times I've visited the island with the same layout and same island shape and nothing in them. Way to bait and switch the experience of visiting 5 islands on end with slight differences.

I'm glad that the events are stowed away so people can't just time travel to get everything off season that's right I'm talking to you time travelers, you're no better than businesses selling their Christmas stuff in August. Boy how hypothetical you all must be.

Worst part is that they made a conscious decision to push the game release date further down the to ensure quality yet there is so many bugs in the game especially game breaking. You can lose your save file for popping a balloon in the sky. Yup every time you do that you risk data loss. Tell me again why was the game pushed back? If that was the choice why wasn't time spent to better multiplayer features. To summarize the game is great single player, terrible multiplayer and so much content is missing the game is bare bones and I'm not talking about holiday things I'm talking about what to do in game. There's nothing to do after an hour of play because the daily ""chores"" are completed that fast.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

Ihaveaname,10-04-2020,"Dear Nintendo ( and anyone who reads this),
Ive been a fan of nintendos consoles and games my whole life. I had pretty much every console that came out after i was born and I loved them.
One of my most loved games was animal crossing. I played every game in the series and even as an adult i played new leaf even till this day. Of cause i bought new horizons as soon as it got out and played it.
Sadly new horizons is why i actually write to you guys for the first time.
The game looks good and the crafting is fun but the game feels empty, unfinished and lacking. It feels like the bare bone basics of any animal crossing before it and thats it. The multiplayer is seriously lacking and that is for an console that has heavily been marketed as something to play together just unacceptable. Local multiplayer is pretty much just running behind someone and waiting for them to do something . The most i can do with the ones quarantined with me is collecting wood while one hits the trees and the other one picks it up and the worst thing is it doesn’t even go to that persons inventory but to that dumb chest. It doesn’t feel like you did or archived anything as the second player. You cant progress and since the game is so empty and the only thing to do is progress means the game is pretty much worthless if you are the second player.

The online multiplayer is better but still boring after a few times there isn’t much to do with the person so it’s mostly just repeating everything you have done that morning on your island on another. I cant imagine why you would go back a step from new leaf there you knew already that there needed to be more for multiplayer and tried to add something.

But the worst for me is that as far as i can see ive already ,,finished,, the game. My main motivations to play regularly in previous games were to build out my house completely, to build out the stores and get all the stores and then at last to make my town look pretty. Those where the long time goals, the big goals that stood over the smaller ones.

Ive already almost completely build out my house because there is nothing else to do in this game than grind for money.
In comparison it took me years to get to this stage in previous installments because there was so much more to do.
As far as i can see ive already hit the top on the nook shop. There doesn’t seem to be another upgrade as far as the Internet can tell me.
And the only thing thats left is making my town pretty and im already almost perfectly happy with everything on that front.

When i started this game it felt abit boring at first because there wasn’t much to do right at the beginning it was slow. Something that already put off one of my friends that bought the game. Then after it picked up a bit i was so glad because i thought this was going to become great. But now after such short time i already have done what i can do and the daily chores have become kinda meaningless.

Even if in updates you guys add stuff that had already been in previous games what motivation do i have to not play around with it for alittle bit and then put it down again? My town is already build all around the limited buildings that are in the game now. Getting rid of everything and terraforming it again will be a chore and will probably make any much needed content thats added less enjoyable.
And when you guys now slowly add the stuff that should have been in it from the beginning will you even bother to put in something new?

It makes me so sad and angry to leave such a bad review on the game. Because i love the game, i love the characters and im sure the people who worked on it put their heart into it. The items look gorgeous the characters and environments too. But the game is empty and it feels like there wasn’t enough time so it got sold unfinished in the hopes that nobody would play through the first part before it could get fixed up into an actual game.
And it pains me so much to say this but i dont know if its worth the money it costs.
I wont be telling my friends to buy it. Maybe ill tell them to wait until it actually gets made into a full game. I hear all the time that it will probably get updates that will ad in more. But for me putting out a game that feels unfinished is unacceptable. Updates shouldnt be there to make it a complete game but to add extra stuff to expand the lifetime of a game.
Im more than disappointed im heartbroken.

I hope this gets to the ones who can actually change anything about animal crossing/ the strategy that is currently used on this game.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

psjim,01-05-2020,"As a single-player experience, this game is phenomenal. I have seen this series progress since the first North American release on the Gamecube and to me, it seems like it just gets better and better. In previous games, it would feel like you are the only character who really matters. Animals would hardly interact with each other or their environments and New Horizons is a breath of fresh air in that department. It is hard to find a time when the animals won't be doing something, whether it's talking to each other, going fishing, or even reading a book. To me, this adds a much better feeling of connectedness between everything on the island. Multiplayer lends itself to getting stale pretty quickly right now, but I don't see that as a criticism that detracts significantly from the overall experience of the game. What you get from this game is a relaxing experience that stands on its own as one of the best in the series.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

ZIGtv,16-05-2020,"After almost two months of playing this, I can confidently say that this is an excellent game, and with the amazing sales, and the constant support for this title, that it will be one of the biggest titles in the Switches lifetime.

Pros:
The amount of detail put into it. For example, the museum, with its hundreds of fossils, fish and bugs.
There is so much to do, you’ll almost never get bored. There are tons of daily activities you do, and the game constantly encourages you to get that 5 star island rating.The seasonal events are mostly very fun(except for bunny day).There were only one or two moments around the end of the 130 hours I’ve played that I had nothing to do, but the next day when all resources re-spawn, you can do your daily chores, meet special characters, and do much more to try and improve your island. The sense of progression, and the feeling that everything on your island was made by you, feels great and rewarding. The online is pretty decent, and I like that you have a best friends list so that your best friends can help you and interact with your island more than strangers.

Cons:

The one island per console limitation is frustrating, since I tried playing with my friends locally, and it was very chaotic and confusing. If you’re buying this to play as a family, I would still recommend it, but only if everyone gets along well, and likes to work together. Some tasks in the game are a bit annoying to do, and the game starts off very slowly since to actually start the actual game and finish the prologue(which is everything before you get the upgraded resident services building), takes 5-6 days.

Overall this is a great game that lived up to its hype, but for families who want to play together, the one island per console limitation is a huge turnoff. 9/10",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Also, animal crossing never gave clear objectives because it’s a do what you want when you want kind of game - extremely casual. You can access your objectives through your nook phone though and they are laid out for you, and all are pretty much optional to complete. Honestly this is a game that long time fans of the series will love, as well as fans of the mobile game pocket camp.

dbrandts,26-03-2020,"This game is an excellent social simulator.

For all of you complaining about the single-console multiplayer experience, I have some rhetorical questions below.

For the complaints about one villager making all the story driven decisions: If you play this game as a family, does everyone in the family make all the real-life decisions or is it just the adults? Does everyone pay for the bills, mortgage, decide where the kids go to school? This game is a social simulator.

For those complaining that you have to wait for the main villager to progress so you can enjoy the island as the second player: Do you not play together? Do you all not enjoy real life together and usually make decisions together? if you are an adult with kids, does the adult make most of the decisions or do the kids? This game is a social simulator.

I understand the Nintendo Switch is very popular and there are many more new players to the Animal Crossing franchise. These complaints are mostly from new players to the series because previous installments of Animal Crossing are similar, i.e., New Leaf. If you played New Leaf and have complained on this site, not sure what you were thinking, and I can't help you.

In conclusion, If you want an adventure game where you share one console but have separate experiences, I recommend The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.

OneWheel,25-03-2020,"I loved this game as I started it up. It was so beautiful and seemed to be everything I wanted in an animal crossing game...

Then the grind started. You need iron to unlock the recipes to explore your whole island. But you can't easily get enough iron to do that unless you can reach the rocks on the inaccessible parts of the island. So you harvest what little you can each day before being forced to wait till the next day to harvest more. And all the while, your tools are breaking, which costs iron to replace, slowing your progress.

When you finally DO unlock the ladder to explore the whole island, you're tasked with wasting much, much more of your precious resources building stupid crap for NPC neighbors.

This game has a lot going for it. BUT so, so much of the great content is locked behind arbitrary, frustrating, grindy nonsense. When you are the only character in the game capable of any decision making, crafting, or planning of any sort, it gets tedious fast. It wouldn't be so bad if you could *purchase* some of the resources you need, but you can't. You have to build the tools to harvest them. You have to harvest them. You have to build the furniture with them. You have to choose where the furniture goes. You have to do everything yourself if you want to unlock everything the game has to offer.

Nintendo promised us an Animal Crossing game where we *could* completely customize every square inch of the island.

Sadly, what they delivered is an Animal Crossing game where you are *forced* to customize every square inch of the island.

This issue combined with the irredeemably stupid choices surrounding cloud saves and multiplayer make this one of the most disappointing games I've ever paid full price for. 5/10

Pnymlc,31-03-2020,"If you have a family of kids who might have some interest in playing this game and you don’t have enough Switch consoles for each of them to have their own island, you may want to reconsider your purchase to avoid family feuds. Currently sharing with 4 family members (5th one pending) and while this game is fun for a solo player with your own island, once you have new players move in, you have to share (Or force others to share) limited resources, creative space, argue over plots of land, villagers and landscaping decisions. You have to greatly modify your play in order to accommodate for others on your island, which may be fun in some cases (co op with your SO) but with kids/others who will ruin things or don’t care about sharing.. your game experience is significantly reduced. Only the first player gets the special missions/rewards and any additional profile that moves in to the island is left in the dark as far as instructions and introductions and additional perks. For $60 you get to fight over who gets to play first in the day to get the limited resources of the island, and for the small cost of ANOTHER console, you can have a separate island for a second player! In the past you can easily have extra game cartridges/memory files for new islands but now you have to buy a whole additional console?! With 7 players in the house, we do pretty good with sharing the Switch so we know we don’t need a second one, so why would you force your players to have a second console for another island? This is outrageous of the game developers, and I will not condone this behavior by big companies who already have a lot of money to begin with.

JLord701,21-06-2021,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons joins titles like The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Mario Odyssey, and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a system seller. This isn’t just a must-have title; it’s a reason to buy a Nintendo Switch.
I went into this game somewhat blind. I’d seen some of the trailers, but this was my first time playing and owning an Animal Crossing game. Additionally, the simulation genre just isn’t my cup of tea. The only other life simulator I’d dabbled in was Stardew Valley(another great game).
However, from the opening minutes, I knew this game would be special. It’s probably the most relaxing game I’ve ever played. After playing New Horizons and more recently, some excellent survival horror titles(Resident Evil 2 and 7), I’ve realized you don’t need fast paced action to make a game enjoyable. However, take that into consideration before purchasing/playing this game. It’s very slow paced and unfortunately, there is some unnecessary tedium. It would go a long way if a feature was added to craft sets of an item instead of crafting them individually(Tip: spam the A-button while crafting to speed up the process). Tool durability is also an unnecessary annoyance. Weapons durability suits a game like Breath of the Wild much better. It lets you experiment with the sandbox and make full use of all your items. That isn’t the case in new horizons. Another minor gripe is playing with multiple accounts. You can only have one island per system. This wasn’t an issue for me since I’m the only one who plays my Switch, but it’s something to keep in mind if you have young children, friends, a spouse/partner, or anyone else who wants their own island.
Like I previously mentioned, this is an extremely slow paced game. Some Players used “time traveling” to speed up the game, but I don’t recommend that. I suggest you play how the developers intended.
With my (mostly)minor gripes out of the way, let’s talk positives. First of all, this game is absolutely gorgeous. It may not quite reach Breath of the Wild, Mario Odyssey, or Mario Kart 8 levels of beauty, but I’d still put it in the top ten best looking games on the system. The art style is amazing, the lighting is top tier, and it ran at a solid 30 frames-per-second with no drops or stuttering from what I noticed. Sound design is as relaxing as it could be. The music is beautiful as well, although it might get on some players’ nerves during extended play sessions, especially before town hall is built.
In terms of strength in gameplay, I’ve never felt this much freedom in many other games. However, if I had to pinpoint my favorite aspect, it was probably collecting bugs, fossils, fish, and other sea creatures, and donating them to the museum. It was always fun having friends visit my island and showing off all of the rare catches I’d obtained. This was one of the few games where I displayed audible excitement whenever I caught a whale shark, sunfish, or oarfish for the first time.
More than many other games, New Horizons displays progress in a visual sense, rather than experience points, cool weapons, or armor. Your island will start out messy and overgrown with weeds and unwanted trees, but as the game moves forward, you’ll unlock more villagers(and their respective houses), shops, and items to put on display. There are plenty of mindblowing islands on display on the internet, that even I(someone who played for more than 150 hours) couldn’t begin to think of. It truly is your experience, and everyone’s will be different.
If I had to point out one last gripe I had with the game, it would be updates. This review is being written almost 1 ½ years after launch, and although Nintendo has been consistently updating the game, it has lost a bit of longevity, but that’s only because I played so frequently at the beginning of the pandemic and I possibly could’ve been burnt out on it. You’ll get plenty of hours out of the game, it’s just after this many, there isn’t as much of a reason to pick the game back up.
Despite the minor issues I have with the game, I think this is a game anyone can enjoy. If you only like fast paced action, you should still give this one a try. I did, and I’ve loved nearly every minute.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Bought the game as a lockdown treat for myself and my kids after we all fell in love with the idea of an island life.

But that's not an option for two of us as only the first player gets to create an island. I can't understand the design choice that results in this, other than Nintendo being desperate to sell more consoles.

Megsterrz,24-03-2020,"This is a rather early on review, as I have been playing for 4 days and I'm sure a lot is subject to change. There are a lot of great improvements from older versions of the game, but unfortunately a lot is lacking, which takes away from the overall gameplay. I will not be focusing on the multiplayer aspect, as I am playing alone on my Switch, and am not encountering problems, though I can totally understand the frustration of those who have to share a console/island. The game is built unfairly for those people.

The game does not have hourly music, which is something previous Animal Crossing games are known for. I miss having quirky, hourly tracks, but the backtrack gets repetitive very quickly. The objective based system is a nice touch, but unfortunately doesn't feel rewarding, and does not lead to any larger objective. Gyroids also are not present in the game, and I REALLY hope they come out with an update.

The game has a slow paced system, which is OK and echoes the Animal Crossing feel, but the delay of introducing characters/villagers/buildings/etc leads to a heavy lack in content. Who knows, maybe they weren't expecting people to have so much time due to the Corona lockdown! I am a bit disappointed that I'm already starting to feel bored after 4 days, especially when the game has been in the making for such a long amount of time.

Luvlymonster,11-04-2020,"I've been a fan of the Animal Crossing series for a long time; I had the gamecube when I was little and I still carry my 3DS in my bag. I wanted an app long before an AC app even went into consideration and as soon as the switch came out I waited. And waited. And here it finally is!!! Beautiful graphics, wonderful old characters, amazing new mechanics, a perfect game, as expected. If you live alone... Some people are saying that Nintendo did this out of greed but I wonder if it wasn't to try and force a style of gameplay on us they want us to use. If so, it's childish and controlling and petty. If not, then yeah, it's greedy. People aren't happy with this not because we can't get along and learn to coexist, but because exploring individual freedoms are what creativity, and therefore this game, are all about. I let my boyfriend play instead. I've already had many great experiences and I wanted this one to be for him, but after 275 dollars for the switch and then 60 for the game, I shouldn't HAVE to sacrifice like that. Nintendo has a pretty solid track record of having great ideas and then ruining them. And you'd think that because of the switch shortage from the virus that this would be as good a time as ever for Nintendo to let it go and let us have our own islands since no one can really find or afford another 300 dollar console to play on. Not that they should have to. I'm surprised people haven't resorted to stealing them out of spite. Even if Nintendo had the dignity and wisdom to fix this mistake, the game is still ruined for me. That first time experience of opening up the game and discovering all it has to offer was smeared the first time I logged in as player two. I'll never have that back.

Spankle,26-03-2020,"Don't listen to the salty review bombers.
The game is nice. It's relaxing and you can really get caught up in the collecting aspect of it. There are only two big issues for me:

1) They still haven't integrated an in-game time travel system yet, despite the fact that you can only play about ~30 minutes to an hour every day if you don't time travel using the Switch's system settings. This is frustrating because the developers know very well that half (if not more) of the players playing the game will time travel anyway, so refusing to make it an in-game mechanic seems like stubbornness. A lot of time is wasted when you have to save, close the game, go to system settings, change the time and re-open the game every 30 minutes just to advance to the next day.

2) As I had feared when the game was announced, the game sadly is not worth the $60 price tag, no matter how you split it. What it does do, it does perfectly, just like all the Animal Crossing games before it, but it just doesn't do enough to warrant the nearly-doubled price compared to New Leaf. There are apps on iOS that legitimately have more content than this game, and this game cost me a whole day's wages. In short, if you're a die hard Animal Crossing fan, you'll probably love this game, but then again, if you really are, then you were going to love it regardless of what I said. If you have not played Animal Crossing before and are looking into it, I would advise against getting New Horizons unless you are flush with cash. You'll get the same experience by buying one of the earlier, cheaper Animal Crossings or a comparable game like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC

The_Man_With_No,19-04-2020,"Only first player can create an island, it is an actual issue for others, but not for me and should still be fixed. This game has a lot of charm and some fun, but a lot of the charm is stepped on by how overly tedious the game is and how terrible the programmers are on a technical side. Want to join an island with a bunch of friends and hold an event? Well, welcome to about 10 minutes of loading screens because every person who comes in NEEDS to essentially reset the island and have a giant loading screen.

It isn't just when it comes to playing online, it is just about every aspect from finding certain characters and needing to prompt dialogue with them 5x to get to the right spot (let's pretend that programmers can't make dialogue a continuous thing lol) or trying to fish and the fish moving a little bit out of your way and having to cast the line with little to no aim. You constantly miss shovel spots, hit spots, balloons, and so many things because the way the game is designed is just... very incredibly poor.

The developers basically see traditional gaming and try to piss on it, which is fine and dandy, but what's left is a technically bad game with overly tedious moments that take control of the game 95% of the play. It seems like Nintendo hired 3rd year programming students who have some help from veterans on how to get stuff done, but overall you can tell the programmers in this game are just daft and at the end of their wits, which is why it also doesn't shock me that it is one island per Switch, it's literally them being incapable of programming that logic into the game.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

It also felt a bit too kiddish for me. The slow progression of the game was really too slow for me and just felt like there wasn't much game there. Also, the villagers wouldn't say much of interest and repeat the same things, and while I like games where you have to figure out things on your own, it also wasn't very intuitive on what to do at times for new players to the series.

guitarmaniac004,02-07-2020,"So I've managed to rack up more than 170 hours in this game so far, making it my most played game of the year so far.

I also think one island per console is a huge annoyance but it's not worth giving the game a 0/100 (ya big babies)

I start off I only played a small amount of new leaf before this game so I was going into this game with little to no knowledge. So I'm no long time fan of the series or anything or the sort.

I guess I'll start off with the pros:

-This game is so damn peaceful.
-Despite the slow progress at the start of the game it never leaves you bored, it leaves you wanting more.
-The progression of your island is entirely up to you.
-The detail of the graphics, animations and lighting is absolutely gorgeous, a huge step forward from previous games.
- The ability to terraform is a big bonus (although it has its own issues).
- If you are a collector/achievement hunter (which I most definitely am), this game will give you plenty to work towards.

So with plenty to do and more to do than ever, what could go wrong... right??
Well a lot apparently.
The cons!!:

-While crafting is a huge step forward for the series, as well as all the benefits it gives. It is the single most tedious experience I have experienced in a long time. It is also the worst part of this game. Why do I have to craft one item at a time, and whyyyyyy does it take so long to craft that ONE item? I spent (and I counted) 7 minutes making
twenty fish bait.

-The tools have no durability bar so you can never tell when they're about to break.

- Of course one island per console is a massive pain in the ass. It's obviously used to get more people to buy their consoles and I guess it works. So great job Nintendo marketing team! (ya knobs).

-Terraforming can turn your island into a beautiful paradise, but it's going to be hell before you get there. It feels clunky to use. You will hit the wrong patch is dirt 9 times before hitting the right one. It's just an all round mess right now and needs a serious overhaul.

-While you can track your bugs and fish, you can't track the fossils you have donated, which was in the last game so I have no earthly idea why they removed it.

-Villagers personality types are far too similar to other villagers. I'm sick of hearing three separate villagers talk about ""the bugs in their floor"". There needs to be more diversity between each villager.

FINALLY, this is not giving nintendo flack for making a shoddy game, I think it's beautiful, addictive and a great way to blow off steam. So I'm just going to give some suggestions the game needs in the future.

-The ability to craft multiple items at a time.
-Manilla clams stacking.
-More buildings/shops to build from Tom Nook (Like the coffee shop, or disco).
-Tracking fossils
-An easier way to terraform
-The ability to boot a villager from your island instead of ignoring them for 2 months.
-Durability bars for tools
-Less frequent rain. My island is starting to look like a jungle.
-Less time it takes to go to another island, seriously I spent probably 3 minutes talking to orville.
-An auto-sort option for my inventory.

You'll see that 90% of these are just quality of life features. Which is exactly what the game needs. I don't care about a diving update if the game continues this way.

But I am unsure how long this will last.
I' already very disinterested in what the characters have to say.
The job of collecting resources (fish, wood, fruit, bugs) in order to grow the town or get new stuff feels more and more like a joyless grind.

Especially crafting / buying objects is senseless.
You can't use ANYTHING except a few simple music instruments.
Bicycles, lawn mowers, Scooters, toys .... nothing is interactive, everything is just to look at.

The only thing in this game that you can do besides gathering resources and placing furniture is ...
sitting down on things.

I wish I could tell you how the multiplayer is, but I have no idea.
Nintendo doesn't let me play this game online.
I have a huge list of friends that own and play this game.
But there is no way to connect with them.

It seems like I would need to know how to contact those people IN REAL LIFE and then give
them a special generated code to invite them to my island.
Just let me invite people from my friend list PLEASE.

I somehow wish this could be my first AC experience, as the game is full of things to discover and do, and undoubtedly has that animal crossing magic of the previous games.

Unfortunately, it also is plagued by the same annoyances of the previous games such as the cumbersome interface, and it does not add a whole lot of new and interesting gameplay mechanics and improvements to entertain returning animal crossing veterans. To me, it seems like nintendo was a bit lazy with this one.

I was really looking forward to this game, but after a week of playing it, its hard to shake the thought im essentially playing a game that hasnt changed any core mechanics to entertain long time players.

Lhant,06-10-2020,"To put it simply, this series thrives more than any other I know of on its long term appeal. Traditionally the series has done this primarily by filling the game with such an abundance of content that you can play for years and still be surprised and see new things occasionally. This particular game in the series has FAR less content to support its long term appeal than ANY other game in the series long history, despite the fact that the majority of the features it does have are not even new.

Yes, they are releasing free content updates occasionally. But at the rate they are going with these updates, it would take many many years to even catch up to this games predecessor in terms of content (AC: New Leaf, 3DS), let alone surpass it.

This game has made a number of improvements to the formula, but it's severe lack of content kills it for me. It takes quite a few hours of playing for you to really notice how much less this game has, but once you really get a feel for that it is hard for me to still give this game any praise.

Right at the start of the worldwide pandemic, ACNH released and allowed us to enjoy a virtual life while being forced to stay indoors.
A simple groundwork of starting off on a isolated paradise island; You are tasked by Tom Nook to help develop your island to a livable home that people will want to come visit and live at. Finding all sorts of villagers along the way to come move to your island. There is almost 400 different villagers you can find that range in personalities and looks.

However, the longer you play, the more you realize that - in comparison to Animal Crossing games in the past - there's really not much to do/not much content in the game.

For any other game, being enjoyable for 80 hours would be amazing, but Animal Crossing has always been designed to be a game which can be enjoyed essentially for as many years as you want. But there's just not enough to do in New Horizons - a ridiculous amount has been cut from previous games, with not enough new things added to make up for it. I imagine Nintendo's plan is to add these things back as free content updates, which is understandable from their perspective as it will keep people playing the game, but there's just not enough content in the base game to keep the game feeling fun and not like a chore to play everyday. Additionally, the villagers have been watered down so much that dialogue is repeated almost constantly, and the characters barely have any personality anymore.

ft5777,03-08-2021,"When the game released in March 2020 I played 30 hours in the first two weeks. I liked it well enough but I wasn't really hooked and I eventually stopped playing it. Until July 2021 that is, when I decided to boot it again and now I'm totally hooked. I put in the effort to unlock terraforming and then the game becomes a brand new game. I initially decided to spread villagers houses all over the island, but now I'm in the process of reshaping my entire island, with a residential area, a town business district, flowery parks with a little lake, a big camping lake, a forest full of waterfalls, and I also placed my house far away from the town in the hills and I want to make it bigger and better furnished. Basically, once you find the motivation to make a great and beautiful island to your tastes, you become hooked and it's a very soothing game. It draws you in like no other game did for me.

Of course, the game is not perfect. I wish Nintendo would bring some much needed quality of life improvements, such as bulk crafting, bulk buying, being able to craft in your house with items stored in your house and not only those stored in your pockets. Also, skipping already seen dialogues. It's currently a game of patience to suffer through Blathers' interminable blabber when you just want to identify and donate a fossil. And that, every time ! I wonder if this is done by design or if Nintendo just doesn't bother making player's lives easier. Bottom line, it is annoying that Nintendo doesn't address those problems, but they don't prevent the enjoyment of the game, far from it.

I'm not playing online so I can't comment on online issues. Also, concerning the one island per console thing, let me just say that I absolutely don't approve of Nintendo's decision to allow only one island per console instead of one island per profile. This seems totally arbitrary and anti-consumer. I am personally not concerned by this and I enjoy the game immensely, I think it is deserving of a 9/10.

moose_stash,30-07-2020,"This is a game that is held back by the fact that it is essentially a beta with constant updates rolling out. I will say, I love animal crossing. I've been playing since the gamecube version and have always loved the charm of having a little town you can escape to. The anthropomorphic animals that become your friends is always welcome in my home and New Horizons delivers on the original concept better than ever before. I've heard critics call this iteration the ""Breath of the Wild"" of Animal Crossing. I can agree. Never before has there been this much customizability and control of your village. Let me start with some of the positives. First, let me talk about some quality of life improvements that aren't commonly talked about. Your villagers never leave in this game unless you prompt them to leave. This is amazing. Especially from the perspective of someone who likes to play the markets. There is an intrinsic value placed on certain villagers depending on how in-demand they are. In previous games, they would move out unprompted and there was nothing you could do to get them back short of buying their respective amiibo cards. Next, the crafting system is just wonderful and plays well in the new improved atmosphere of New Horizons. It adds a bit of whimsy and character to a series already chock full of the stuff. Now some negatives. As people can see by the review score, you're locked into one island per switch. Which isn't that crazy considering that has been the take of Animal Crossing historically. The biggest thing that knocks it down from being a perfect game for me is the fact that the content wasn't all there upon release. Animal crossing requires long-term dedication for hours a day (within the first few months of this game I have over 300+ hours on my save) and the game can start to feel a little stale by the time a new content update is released. While the charm and whimsy certainly make-up for this fact. There's too many triple-A releases coming out to justify the enormous dedication it takes to do everything you want in this game.

Alvz9,20-07-2020,"Es el primer juego que tengo el honor de probar en la saga. Mi primer Animal Crossing; y la verdad, no puedo creer la experiencia que he vivido durante estos meses. Un juego que propone un concepto sencillo, vivir el día a día, hacer cosas de rutina, pero que es profundamente adictivo y te llama a estar constantemente remodelando tu Isla, o tu casa, y preocupándote de tus vecinos. Además este juego tiene un significado nuevo en estos tiempos de cuarentena, donde el distanciamiento social nos quita la posibilidad de conectarnos con otros. De momento, el mejor juego de Switch del año.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

TwoFaceTiger,06-04-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a great game, but does have some downsides.

I have been playing this game over 2 weeks now and I love it. gathering fossils, fishing, bug catching and as of now the bunny day(week) event. As i have seen online most people had their island mostly done by time traveling, as for me i will be not time traveling . But this is a game that keeps me coming back and slowly watching my island grow with each new finished project or a new guest comes and visits the island. But as i am playing game it can/gets boring after 2 hours of gameplay, but because there only so much you can do in a real time game.

But overall If you are big Fan or new comer to Animal Crossing series this a game that is worth checking picking up.

Will update later in the year!",7,ACNH,METACRITIC

I now own 3 switches and 3 copies of the game to have my whole family visit each other. It is so nice to have all little chores without violence and stress. No in-app-purchases too. All money is just ‘earned’ in the game. There are so many things to build, so many to animals to collect. It is really genius that Redd sells genuine and fake art.

saad0,06-05-2020,"The art style and design of characters and objects have always complemented each other in this franchise, the contrast between the life-like fish, fossils and bugs and the chibi-like villagers and animals greatly appeals to the eye. One thing that keeps bugging me about this game is the lack of character development between the player of the game and his neighbours. In older Animal Crossing games, your animal neighbours were strangers, and as strangers would act, they wouldn't instantly like you or be instantly gratuitous towards you. This made them personified in a way, they were more characteristic and the bond you formed with them felt more real. However, in this game, although the villagers are more expressive and DO more natural things, they FEEL almost robotic in the ways they act towards you, they say the same things, they feel the same way. It doesn't feel like they are truly happy when they are, or when they're angry, or when they're sad. But, even with that in mind, this game is still an amazing experience

Nintendo, make the characters more characteristic. Please.

Tough I did not spend a lot of time digging into the game, I have played more than 100 hours. In addition, I'm not the main player of the island, but I'm fine with it since I'm not playing a lot, and I still feel this is a good game. My girlfirend, who is the owner of the island, has played more than 500 hours, which means this can be a very attractive game for some players. If you feel you want the full control of the game, and want to spend a lot of time on it, you should buy a switch for it. For me, although I'm not the main player, it does not ruin my game experience, and it even makes me feel easier.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Basagh,19-06-2020,"(No he jugado los juegos anteriores) La verdad, el juego me encanto, me imagino que es porque tuve la oportunidad de tener una isla para mi solo y jugarlo en paralelo con mi hermano. el hecho de poder ir viendo como el otro progresa junto a ti y poder compartir conocimientos, es maravilloso. Respecto al juego en si, esta bastante bien, ya que que el sistema de progreso en el juego, esta bien implementado, teniendo que esperar al siguiente día para poder avanzar, impidiendo que se haga una experiencia corta. La personalización es bastante buena, pudiendo cambiar; la forma y color de los ojos, la forma y color del pelo, distintas zapatillas, pantalones, accesorios para la cabeza (sombreros, gorras, mascarillas, etc.), y lo mas importante (desde mi punto de vista), poder personalizar tus propios polerones, camisas, chaquetas, poleras (con o sin mangas), y a la vez, poder descargar diseños de otros jugadores y compartir tus diseños. Tu isla puede cambiar demasiado, existen muchísimos esquemas distintos que sirven para fabricar una gran variedad de artículos, grandes y pequeños, para ambientar como tu quieras tu isla. un punto muy débil, es la nula presencia del cooperativo, limitándose a una isla por pantalla, la razón por la que esto no le bajo mas la nota, fue porque no interfirió con mi experiencia, pero comprendo a las personas que si. En conclusión es un juego bastante didáctico, duradero y personalizable, pero si quieres disfrutarlo con otra persona, vas a tener que tener dos nintendo switch y dos copias del juego",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

lqstuart,28-12-2020,"The complaints about progression if you're player 2+ are entirely valid and I have a hard time wrapping my head around the thought process that led to those design decisions without chalking it up to stupidity or incompetence. If you don't care about having only a single island per console, or only one player who can progress the story--which I don't, I was honestly glad to not have to deal with that--then you still have to contend with the issues of being unable to build bridges or craft really basic furniture. On top of that, the controls are awful, dialog is incredibly repetitive and tedious, and for a game whose entire purpose is decorating your island, this has the worst customization options imaginable short of not actually offering any at all. If you don't believe me, then feel free to stop by my house full of urinals and giant baseball helmets because I can't buy a bed or a proper table.

From the wild world, to new leaf and now to this. Witnessing the improvements was just nostalgic. To be able to terraform and design your island is so amazing. Amazing game for quarantine days. This is a chill game so to fully appreciate everything is not to play fast like timetravelling. You don’t need to beat anything. That’s why even if the updates are slow, I love how they drop it one a time so as not to get bored easily. Live the life as an islander/villager.

Еноты просто красавчики, мой остров просто райский уголок. Мы живём на острове с персонажем моей девушки и ещё десятью прямоходящими животными :))

Это весёлая и необычная для белого человека игра, но ловить насекомых и рыбу, выкапывать кости динозавров и просто радоваться беззаботной жизни на острове оказалось намного веселее, чем это звучит. Хорошая игра, 8/10

I have only had it for about 10 days but I've already sunk at least 25 hours into it.

Ciscocat,05-07-2020,"I've never played any Animal Crossing before, however New Horizons was a rewarding experience. From what I know of the previous instalments I think the building of your own town on this island is the best evolution possible. I enjoy the nooks and crannies of my island including the literal Nook's Cranny store, in which it's exciting to see what new items I can afford for my house. It's got a good sense of humour and it exudes positive vibes.

With the consensus that this is a fairly good game I must denote the sometimes baffling negatives:

-You can't have one island per user, only one per console. The 0's piling up on this website only serve to show how broken Metacritic's user system is. However it is really stupid. I don't think it's intentionally greedy, or if it's a storage thing, I think Nintendo was just stupidly paranoid about ""cheating"" but I can't think of anything off the top of my head that would totally undermine the game if they had an island per user.
-Menus and especially shopping menus, my god. They are not intuitive at all. I hate to compare it to another game but it doesn't have the quick interface of something like Minecraft. Also the lines of dialogue need to be way faster, I don't have all the time in the world to listen to Blathers.
-Digging, picking up stuff and landscaping can be absurdly frustrating. Again it's slow and imprecise to hit things with your shovel, and don't get me started on how many times I've picked up the wrong object, or haven't been able to place something because it wasn't clear, or shaped the wrong cliff or river. I know it's not meant to be a platformer or action-adventure but I think avatars would benefit from a much more robust moveset, and an interface that's a lot more precise and doesn't take its sweet time.

With that out of the way, ACNH is fun, and I'm burnt out on it now but when the world gets closer to ending I'll come back to it and have a grand old time.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

davicilio20,12-07-2020,"Animal Crossing: New Horizons ha sido posiblemente el juego más esperado de la saga.


Sigue transmitiendo la sensación de tranquilidad y calma que ya existía en las anteriores entregas, las mecánicas principales se han mantenido como el uso de las herramientas ya existentes y se ha llegado a aumentar con instrumentos de mano y las ya famosas escalera de mano y pértiga.


Un punto a favor de este juego (que para otros será en contra) es la dosificación del contenido. Los viajantes en el tiempo seguramente sean los que han provocado esto, para no destripar todo el juego de un día para otro como se demostró que pasó en el 2º día de juego.


Este no es el juego más completo de la saga hasta el momento (yo considero que el más completo al día que se escribe esta review es el New Leaf por la gran cantidad de edificios que hay y sus funciones), pero sí es el más ambicioso, debido a la promesa de actualizaciones durante al menos los dos siguientes años y la adición de nuevas mecánicas nunca antes vistas en la saga.


Dicho todo esto, tras más de 300 horas jugadas puedo concluir que: este es el juego que más he disfrutado y sigo disfrutando en mi vida, y llegando a ser perfecto para este confinamiento que en España llevamos viviendo desde justo una semana antes del lanzamiento del juego. El mejor juego para encerrarse en casa sin ninguna duda.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

SFJohnnyG,28-03-2020,"Don't believe the hype and don't drink the Kool-aid. While this game is graphicallly beautiful and the Animal Crossing style of gameplay has been taken to new (and better) levels. Nintendo made decisions around multi-player and family sharing that make this game broken.
For me personally, the multiplayer shortcomings aren't too significant. I like walking around with my son and discovering new things and showing off our accomplishments. I am not a big online person so I have not tried that part of the game, but I do understand people's frustration at not being able to combine online and local multi-player to enhance the experience.
I am more bothered by the way families (or Switch co-owners) are required to experience this game. The concept of needing a unique game and unique Switch to have separate islands is a blatant cash grab by Nintendo. This would not be an issue were the single island shared equally. There is, however, as system where the first person to create a character in the game becomes the ""island representative"", which means they are responsible for decisions such as where new houses will be built. The location of buildings is not a huge problem as you can spend five minutes sitting together and agreeing on these things. What is a big deal is that secondary players are EXTREMELY limited in how they can contribute to these endeavors. Basically, you can send or give materials to the primary player, but this means that when a secondary player is enjoying the game, progress is halted unless they take out two controllers. My son wants to enjoy the game in a way that is characteristic of secondary player play style, but he is the primary player. This has led to a few arguments already as I ask him to focus on an island progression task but he just wants to collect bugs. This would be tolerable if you could switch the primary player or there was some alert that this might happen, but there is absolutely no in-game indication of the significance of being the primary player.
Bottom line, we are four days in and have made lots of progress, but we are thinking of starting over to save our family relationship. This game could have been amazing and allowed me to relax and have fun with my kid, but Nintendo broke it.
Also, no online backup. Seriously, Nintendo, I am losing my faith in you as a company.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
Johnholl1000,30-03-2020,"It really pains me to give this game a low rating because honestly it does so many things right. In truth, this game would definitely earn a 9 or 10 out of 10 were it not for one glaring issue. The fact that the game limits you to one island per console. This is bad for so many reasons that countless others have already pointed out. Obviously it means that multiple people are limited to sharing a single experience instead of being able to have their own separate adventures. But that isn’t really why I am so frustrated by this game. No, actually my fiancé and I were very excited to build our island life together and the idea of sharing this experience was something we were both super excited for. The real problem is that WE DON’T get to share the same experience together! That’s because in this game the only person who gets to enjoy the full game is the person that founds the island. Everyone else is treated as a second class citizen unable to trigger any of the main progression events and relegated to doing only the more tedious chores the game has to offer. So many of the missions and DIY recipes are locked away to these players. I could go on about this forever but to keep things brief, this one flaw in game design has single handedly destroyed our desire to play this game that we were so excited to play. The only half-viable solution seams to be buying another console (and probably another copy of the game). Now given the recent collapse of society, switch consoles have become exceedingly hard to come by. But even if that weren’t the case, I still wouldn’t be willing to buy another system because it feels like that was the entire reason the game was designed in this manner. This feels so scummy and is the worst part of this whole situation. Really hope that the necessary changes get made but I expect they won’t. Until then my score stands.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
Sorachii,31-03-2020,"This game has a lot of charm and it can be fun. But it is absolutely dull if you want to play local multi-player. The second and following players lack the same decision making as the first player. Also you can't have more than one island per console.

Sommy88,31-03-2020,"Bought this game for having a relaxing time. Unfortunately the game stress the heck out of you for the wrong reasons

-No cloud save
-Only one island per switch and only one normal player per switch.

Kinda not relaxing when all my progress is in jeopardy and cant even have someone fully share the experience

-No buyable baits
-nearly impossible to catch special fishes
-unneccessary unskippable dialogue for every little thing(yeah it's the 10000 fish i take or the 10000 bait i made, STOP WASTING MY TIME)

Everything is geared upon making you waste time, turning an adorable and relaxing experience in a neverending and frustrating series of chores .

I am sorry, i really would like to love this game. But to me it's obvious that more testing, more QoL measures and a more modern approach would have been way better and needed for the masterpiece we were really waiting for.

EhrenGib,31-03-2020,"Just as other reviewers are stating, good game, however, the multiplayer aspect/island limit makes it unplayable for me. SO started the game and due to lockdown has been progressing without me, so by the time I get back into the game I don't think I'll care to play. Very disappointed.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
madikc,31-03-2020,"Some seriously questionable mechanics. Like for example, in order to play online so your friends can visit your island, you have to enter the airport, sit through the same dialog text, tell the NPC at the counter to open your island for visitors, wait while the game saves and shows a 'Connecting to internet' screen for 10 secs. Then the island will be open for visitors.

The problem is, if you want to do practically anything in the game (send a letter, turn in the daily ghost quest, etc), you have to go back to that NPC, turn off online play (sitting through the same text and screens), just to do that action. Then you have to travel back once you've done your thing, and re-enable the island. It's just annoying, tedious, frustrating, and seemingly unnecessary - considering you're always online - case in point, friends can text you on your in-game phone... they just cannot visit you. Super dumb.

Now lets say you want to have multiple people in the house play the game, and each person wants their own playthrough - cannot happen. The game will literally only let you have one playthrough per Switch, and everyone has to share the same island. That means a family member can clean the whole island out (smash all the rocks, dig up all the fossils, etc), and when you decide to play later, the island is picked clean. Not to mention someone can advance the story, and you miss it. Seriously not cool. We have 3 people in our family that play the Switch, and only 1 can play Animal Crossing.

There are also gameplay mechanics that were badly implemented. For example, if you want to sell items (which is the only real way to make money), you have two choices: walk up to the store mailbox and sell the items -or- enter the store, wait for the load screen, talk to the store keeper and go through his dialogue, sell your items, leave the store, watch the loading screen again. The problem is you get 100% of the sell price of your items if you talk to the storekeep, but only like 60% of the price if you use the box on the outside of the store. They explain the outside box as a way to sell items whenever the store is closed (they are open 9am to 10pm daily), but at the penalty of changing you a heavy fee. I get why the outside-hours-box charges a fee (even if I think it's a stupid mechanic), but why are they charging me the fee when the store is still open? Why must I sit through two loading screens and a dialogue tree just to vend my items at full price?

It's mechanics like this that really suck the fun out of the game, and turn it into a downright chore. The novelty of the cute load screens, or crafting animations, or lengthy repetitive dialogue really gets in the way of fun. Also it loses 4 points outright for the dumb single island mechanic. Bad job, Nintendo.",3,ACNH,METACRITIC
NewGamer136,31-03-2020,My son and daughter have always lovedAnimal Crossing. They were thrilled that New Horizons was coming out and that we could all play together. The game is great for 1 player.

You have no value and don’t add to the gameplay. I would love to see a split screen option or where each player can have the same gameplay as the creator of the island.,2,ACNH,METACRITIC
ridley369,01-04-2020,"As a diehard fan of the series, who's sunk hundreds and hundreds of hours into them all, and who STILL plays the GameCube version almost daily since 2002, I'm really disappointed with this one.

I'm going to give objective reasons, followed by my subjective opinions afterward. So let's just get right into it...

1) One town per Switch? Why? GameCube let you have a town per memory card, and that was almost 20 years ago. Also, why is whoever founds the town, the one who can make the progress in the game?

2) Dialogue. It's common agreement in the fanbase that, every AC game after the original has gotten worse with villager dialogue, with New Horizons, it's really hit rock bottom. One liners seem to be the most common response when talking to villagers; Yesterday, one of mine said ""Today was fun!"" four times in a row. Are you actually serious, Nintendo?

3) Furniture. Where in the world are the themed furniture sets? The different series? The Animal Crossing games' lifeblood is its unique and themed furniture. Yes, I'm aware there are a few out there - Rattan, Imperial, Cute - I may be missing one or two others, but I don't think so, at least not that I'm aware of so far. And seasonal/holiday sets don't count, because they're exclusive to those holidays and events. I'm talking about run-of-the-mill sets you could always hope to find at Nook's, or receive from villagers, and so on. Where's the Modern series? Classic? Cabana? Lovely? Exotic? Why am I seeing, for the most part, the same, or identical pieces of furniture rotated in my (upgraded) Nook's Cranny? It's all the same generic, non-themed pieces with slight color variations - and this also applies to flooring and wallpaper, which seemed to be as generic as they possibly could be. Are sets being added in later? If so, why? Why couldn't they be included as part of the base game?

4) House expansion. There's so much extensive customization in mostly all other aspects of New Horizons, yet we have to upgrade our house in a rigid, set-in-stone order. Why? I just wanted to have the expanded central room, with the 2nd floor and maybe basement later on. Such was my surprise when I found out that I HAVE to add a back room, then I have to pay it off and then I HAVE to add the left room, then add the right room, THEN I could have the second floor. Why, Nintendo? In New Leaf, we were given the option as to how we wanted to expand, and the second story was the first upgrade after expanding your main room. I don't want side rooms, why can't I upgrade my house how I want like in the other games? I NEED to know why you've deliberately removed this.

**Subjective gripes

1) Very few patterns/shirts from the other games, which have always been staples. We're still early into the year and gameplay, so I'm sure they change with the seasons, but so far I've only seen the Misty Shirt and Frog Shirt, as far as staple clothing.

2) Totakeke songs shouldn't be buyable from the terminal in the town hall, because it negates any real reason to listen to K.K. play songs and get the airchecks from him, since you can just buy 7 different songs in a week. More, if you're a time traveler.

3) Where are the gyroids? Another staple of the Animal Crossing series, completely absent, save for Lloid, and he's not furniture so he doesn't count.

4) Art exhibit in the museum - why is it not in the game? Art has been a collectible item in every AC game, yet not only can we not donate them to the museum (the exhibit doesn't exist), but we art pieces aren't even in the game. Not even paintings. Why? I'm sure they're going to be in some DLC down the road, but why weren't they included in the base game?

I'm gonna leave it at this, despite probably being able to think of a few more subjective points. In conclusion, this game is fun, it's very customizable for the most part, and there's lots of interesting things to do, but as an Animal Crossing game, it doesn't hold up. There was more to do, collect, buy, etc. 20 years ago in the first game, than in New Horizons.
Nintendo (and I'm not afraid to say this) half-assed this game. It feels rushed and very incomplete, despite the fact that New Leaf came out 7 years ago, wherein they had all that time to really make the most amazing Animal Crossing experience ever. They dropped the ball, and as a passionate lover of this series, I'm extremely disappointed, and it makes me really sad to have to say that, not even two weeks after it came out.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
GetCrazed,16-04-2020,"It’s a one player game, for the most part, so deal with it. For what it is, it’s an amazing game. You don’t need to gripe about the multiplayer. While it is a bad feature, the game is still incredibly beautiful and fun to play.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
sophie899,01-04-2020,"Great gameplay. Looks beautiful, and I love the calming nature of the game. However there are a few things that really bother me playing. One part are the birdcages, and this is because I know kids play this game. They are so small the birds can’t move, and while they aren’t real I know this isn’t uncommon in real life. I don’t like to be nit-picky but I would like if they could make an updated size, so people don’t normalize that sort of treatment. I think the same should apply to goldfish and betta fish, very common pets among young children, which is the target audience of the game. These fish are more often than not kept in the same conditions portrayed , and I believe while it is a game, they should still make an example for kids.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
lcb3,03-04-2020,"Overall, I think this is a decent title and I would have rated it higher except for the problems with multiple accounts playing on a single switch. The primary user (my wife in my case) can get certain objectives but I can help by gathering the resources she needs to complete them quickly. Other that that, I haven't run into any real negatives in playing (although I find the new ""Bunny"" stuff rather annoying). Overall I've had fun playing together as well as individually.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Faksnap1000,07-02-2023,Is it a game or just a stupid time waster? My review score shows you what I think.,4,ACNH,METACRITIC
Zylir,03-04-2020,"There's a few issues I have with this game. The lack of online interactive related things and unnecessary long transitions when people leave your island, the fact that there's only a ""Real time"" option, and that there's no way in game to advertise your island. I'd love a brochure to ""sell"" your island, tell people you have certain things there and be more social with it by showing it off maybe and saying stuff like ""Hey, I have a tarantula island, come on by!"" Create more of a city, involve more on your island. I just feel it's so limited for not really a good reason but to be a cop out. I'd love more interaction with the citizens and events with them. Everything seems so bare bones for a $60 game.

I'd also enjoy it if you had sort've a function to treat it like stardew valley where it had it's own hastened day/night cycle to an extent. I'd like to at least play the game in a few weeks, enjoy all there is to see and catch/do quests for everyone in that time frame. It's just not there, just nooks increasing debt with everything you do. I get that ""animal crossing may just not be for me"" however, I don't think a lot of what I said are bad idea's nor would make people dislike the game any. Do people really enjoy the game mostly being played only an hour or so at a time and all these things that you probably wont ever get done because you may not be playing in the September time frame to catch certain things?

The last thing is the most obvious though. Not sharing your island. Me and my gf share the switch because I barely play Nintendo games and so she somewhat does, so very little reason to own two. People telling others ""Why not just own 2 switches! stop being poor!"" why should we be punished for their poor design choice? Such a weird thing to defend a company on.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
Mirr,07-04-2020,No se pueden crear dos islas en la misma consola.

Volpatron9000,07-04-2020,Im addicted to this game however i have some major issues. First is the one island per console isnt a wise move. Second there's literally zero new content after you renovate the store ONCE NPCS are nonexistent besides villagers blathers the nooks and isabelle ( i don't count the dodos **** those guys ) like how can you have a 2020 release game have less content than the 3ds game that came out in 2012... wheres brewster wheres gracie wheres resetti?? And that rescue app doesn't count. This game is overall extremely disappointing it pretty much boils down to a happy home designer spinoff disguised as a triple a title. Im beginning to thing that they made the beginning slow on purpose to pad out the game a little bit. I can't believe this is the game we've been waiting for i hope they update it soon or come out with an expansion pack or dlc because i feel ripped off and i got this as a gift. Smh Nintendo you didnt ruin animal crossing but you definitely watered it down 2/5 compared to the other games i dont want to give it a one or a zero because the game is stunning to look at but besides that its a shadow of its former self still fun to play but i got way more enjoyment out of new leaf i still haven't unlocked everything in that game and ive been time traveling like crazy in that game. For at least a year on and off but i've pretty much unlocked everything in less than two weeks in this one... its comparable to mgsv ground zeroes and thats not a compliment,2,ACNH,METACRITIC
TheAlucard,07-04-2020,There are lots of features taken out of this game from previous games. Seems like Nintendo really just threw this game together. It’s becoming more and more disappointing every day. Previous titles have way more content.,2,ACNH,METACRITIC
Joewhite41,08-04-2020,"As expected the game is brilliantly fun and relaxing, I haven't skipped a day playing it since it came out and I don't see myself doing so in the future, however does that mean the game is actually any good? Well the short answer is no. The reason I come back every day is because you have to, if you want to choose which villagers you have in your town you have to come back every day and hope someone is staying at the campsite as it's near impossible to find them on islands. if you want to fill your house with furniture you actually like you're basically just hoping to get something good in the store every day. If you want something to do you have to hope there's an NPC in the village that day. It's been less than a month since it came out and I'm already just logging on, checking my shops, getting my message in a bottle, collecting my nook miles, and leaving as that's really all there is to do. I cannot decorate my town or my house any more as I've got no more furniture that would look good. I can't get new villagers because they barely show up on islands, I can't progress with the story as the amount of stars your village has depends only on having more villagers (my friend regularly tells me he wishes his island looked like mine, but he has three stars because he has 10 villagers whereas I have one because I have six villagers), I cannot try to grind bells as nearly everything ends up being an egg during this event. There really is absolutely nothing to do. then there's the huge cutscene that means it can take nearly two minutes just to go to someone else's island and every time someone comes to your island you have to stop what you're doing and wait for the stupidly long cutscene, Not to mention the fact you cannot play on two accounts unless you want to share an Island which puts you at a huge disadvantage. Overall just not a well thought-out and designed game.",1,ACNH,METACRITIC

QuesoCaeso,08-04-2020,"The game is limiting on how to get Five stars on your island, it has a set way of calculating how your island is rated but it clashes with themes and styles of building ones island.

this game makes you suffer psychosomatic disorders.

it starts gradually, and then it gets worse, and worse and worse.

3) which is why people hit plateu here after that initial high. it's addictive but not in a fun game sorta way, but like addiction proper. nook miles become external goals that prevent your brain from ever ""finishing"" aka getting some rest.

piscesperiod,13-10-2020,"I particularly enjoy the laid-back atmosphere of this game. It's truly unique. You do things in your own time, at your own pace. Animal Crossing is also a neat reminder that everything takes time, in a day and age where we've grown to be accustomed to unrealistic speed and high expectations.

I've been playing for a couple months now, and I'm enjoying it a lot. Bounding with the villagers is really cool, customising your island and character and seeing how the flowers bloom, bridges are built and seasons pass is more entertaining than I thought it would be.

The downsides I'd say are how you can never choose quantity of items, you always have to buy and sell one by one (notable exception of flowers and shrubs, which you can buy in bulks). Also having to first craft a flimsy tool to only then be able to craft the normal one (crafting the tool directly would have been appreciated).",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

sokidan,13-04-2020,"I have mixed opinions on this game, which I will list below:

Positive:
+ Addition of crafting and Nook Miles makes it more game-like, and have more incentive to play
+ Customization of furniture, and being able to place items outside increases creativity
+ Some Quality of life improvements, like not being stopped by store-keepers when entering and leaving
+Animals have more animations, cute.
+ Terraforming is a neat addition

Negatives
- Terraforming controls are finnicky and overly-time consuming to use
- No way to craft in batches
- Animals repeat themselves constantly
- Online is terrible with dodo codes. Load times everywhere, constant errors
- Lack of furniture sets
- Less stores, upgrades, and main characters than in past titles
- One Island per Switch
- Player 2 is a glorified NPC, unable to do anything while you are the leader
- Game repeats same song for first week, become grating fast
- Loading in-between museum rooms is grating, same with in houses

All in all, it is an entertaining time-waster, but this is NOT a 10/10 game. Cute, yes, but it has a wide array of issues and quality-of-life problems that alone knock it down points.

HazelFayes,14-04-2020,"It's rather unfortunate to see all of the negative reviews for what should be considered such a great game. Animal Crossing New Horizons is such a fresh take on the series and offers so much more to players than previous entries. It has great online play and the visuals just feel extremely nice, although a bit more of the gridlocked side. Villagers are all super friendly, albeit, a bit boring with their repetitive dialogue types. The small attempt of a story or some sort of plot is welcoming and very unobtrusive to the main aspects of the game. Not to mention, the Nook Miles program gives such a great incentive to keep playing the game, and just using every feature the game has to offer.

Some things noticeably offputting- which does have a load of the fanbase lowering their reviews- is these things listed:

-While you can speed through crafting animations, you can't essentially just skip the entire animation.
-You can't craft multiples of things all at once, therefore having to go through tedious crafting sessions.
-As mentioned before, dialogue with villagers still remains seriously repetitive, including main npc characters (Nook, Isabelle, etc...)
-Local multiplayer is tedious, especially doing the follow the leader with other players. It's terrible and not incredibly fun.
-The game being locked to one island per console is relying on a relic system from the past which should've been obsolete by now. Furthermore, players who aren't the leader of the island cannot progress through the story until the leader player does. For a game that advertises multi-user friendliness, this drawback really drains out that aspect.

Although these are some unfortunate drawbacks overall, the game is still super good and has lots of growth potential. Hopefully, Nintendos AC dev team will listen to the complaints users have, and fix some of these things.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
DaLawUK,16-04-2020,"This is a hard one to score, Two different scores for time travelling and non.

5/10 non
8/10 TT

Usually this would be the other way around right? because if you don't skip days then you have more to do over time. At the same time correct and incorrect. This is from a time travellers perspective though.

For time travellers they are able to skip to any day of the year and be able to catch fish/bugs that are meant for that time of year. Games come out so frequently nowadays that you could end up forgetting you even have Animal crossing to play when another game comes out that your absorbed into. So being a time traveller you can put so much time into the game so quickly and be able to get as much possible from it without having to do so much waiting. I Time travelled and i sunk in an easy 100 hours doing stuff and enjoyed most of it. From doing all this i found some stuff that could affect a casual non TT playthrough.

The waiting days has been in since the begining but in this game its next level, theres alot more you have to wait days to do. Which means alot less of being able to play while waiting for these. Everything is IRL time based, so its not even like you can spend time trying to finish your collections because you have to wait for that during times of the year. So combining it all it just makes less to do rather than more. Its more over time, this game is perfect for you if you can only sink in a couple hours a day. Its really not even hard to get money in this, so you can do everything you need to do in a couple hours each day. Theres no more burrying your shovel to get golden either with this new recipe thing, so you now have to do something that comes randomly each week and you have to do it 30 times. Which is another you having to wait day by day to check if that persons there. The amount of waiting you have to do has been increased by around double, which imo isnt a good thing as like i said games come out alot and you can just end up forgetting about your island. I never felt like this in the past couple of games and they still had all this in, just less of it.

The local multiplayer really needs some work for the next game, should be two completely different save files and only join each others island if your both logged in at the same time and P1's island is the one you go to. I don't really local multiplayer though so this doesn't really affect me as much.

All that really comes down to this is there is just alot more waiting in this one and for someone that wants to spend 10 hours on this with a day off work. You are going to get bored as the game is constantly at a dead end. Someone that can only fit in a couple hours a day this is perfect for you.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
SupervisedChaos,18-04-2020,This is unacceptable. I cannot believe my entire family need to share an island this game is not at all worth the price tag on it. I want a refund.

lyds,26-04-2020,I want to start off saying this game is great and I'm enjoying it but I will say it's a bit more stressful than the DS version because there's a lot of running around and collecting but I'd say that's just apart of the game. The only thing I want changed as soon as possible is the only one island feature. I have a younger brother and he is on my island because he wants to play but cant make decisions or do really anything because its my island and I want to create it so he's only allowed to gather things which saddens both of us and on top of that he has the possibility of ruining things and he takes many resources I need. PLEASE ADD ANOTHER ISLAND FEATURE. Also the follower and leader same device multiplayer thing Is super annoying. At least make it so there's multiple islands... otherwise it's fun.,7,ACNH,METACRITIC
FloofGaming,01-03-2022,"I’ve enjoyed my time with new horizons a ton I loved how they improved on customization and things of the sort but there are many sore thumbs that stick out to me being a long time fan, one is how any other accounts on the switch are forced to share an island now this isn’t a big problem for me as I’m the only one who plays but it is a big problem in terms of progressing as you can’t help out to expand the island, only the first person can cause a lot of hassle, so the rating loses a point from that, then secondly it feels like most of the loved furniture sets aren’t even in the game and with that it feels empty along with multiple NPCs missing it just makes me feel like this game was rushed even though in reality it was worked on for a long time, it feels bad to be harsh like this but there’s just a couple of big negatives that pushed the score down for me

Edit: back after almost 2 years, I'm dropping my score quite a bit now. The new updates were a step in the right direction but overall didn't fix the game's primary issue and that was longevity.
The longevity of this game wasn't good when compared to new leaf and I believe that's due to the very limited selection of items and overall barely any progression system.
Sure they added froggy chair back but still loved item sets never came back and felt replaced by less charming items. Then the shop never got anymore upgrades along with no other buildings on the island being added, it was a big disappointment hearing they would stop the free updates and it felt like they took our money and ran with it.

This is the worst animal crossing game to get started with and would recommend the older ones opposed to this.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC
TheDSiscool,13-05-2020,"One island per console? Yes, please! For the past 3 games this is the way it's been. Gamecube was the one where you could have multiple and that required multiple memory cards. Yet I don't see people review bombing those. Those were better games too.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
masevein,03-05-2020,"Update: After playing it for awhile I have had a change of heart. I still believe each cartridge should allow multiple island but I’ve been having lots of fun sharing the island with other users.

Wow Nintendo! This is a very Greedy move on your end to ONLY have ONE island per user and console! I bought this game to play with my wife only to find out you could only have ONE island. This is NOT OKAY! You used to care about your fans and customers but now I’m falling out of love with Nintendo. I’m not sure if I would ever buy another game because $60 is a lot of money to pay.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
MusSoap,01-05-2020,"Alright. Honestly speaking, this game is a good 7-8/10. The core gameplay is nothing too different from the usual game. Little improvements to the game, like actually having the option to move your home / being presented with a multitude of crafting recipes for decor is very welcome. The number of villagers possible to meet (and invite) is astounding! While not every villager makes a comeback in the game, but a number of characters last seen in the original Animal Crossing finally make a return in this game after not appearing in earlier games.

I do find fault with the one island per console thing, but... I think that has been overly addressed to the point where My main issue with the game is the UI / Camera Layout.

Listen, I'm fine with not being able to rotate my camera outside of my house. It really isn't needed. What is needed, however, is the ability to look top-down. Way too many times have I missed a glowing spot because they're hidden behind a building or something. It's great that you've included it with the end-of-game mechanic, which isn't to be named for spoiler warnings, but I think it should become part of the core game mechanic.

The DIY crafting menu sucks, and so does the inventory menu. Let's say you're trying to craft items to sell because they make a ton of bells. Sure, you can mash A to speed up the crafting process, but what if you don't want to stress out the button you already spam for fishing? Gotta fork up some money to buy a controller with turbo, or something. I'd much rather have the option to craft multiple items at once. Speaking of ""multiple items at once"", it also wouldn't hurt to change how people divide stacks in your inventory. You need to select the item, and select ""grab one"" in order to move separate something from a stack, but only at one at a time. It'd be great if we could indicate how many we would like to separate from said stack to save on time. Also worth mentioning, but I don't think the game's worth $60. I don't have a reasoning behind this, but... I think $50 might be a more appropriate price.

With all of that said, I'm not dropping the game. I love it and will keep playing it. It sucks that my little sister can't play the game too, but since I am playing this single-player... I'm fine with this. Hopefully, they can repatch the game to support multiple players in the near future.

TL;DR:

Pros:
- ""Similar"" enough to older games
- Able to finally move your home.
- So many villagers to meet, some returning for the first time in a while!

Mixed:
- Crafting is cool but kinda tedious.

Cons:
- Camera angels are kinda annoying to hold.
- ONE PROFILE PER CONSOLE.
- Controversial opinion, but I don't think it's worth $60.

Verdict: Honestly a 7.5/10, but I'll give it an 8.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

While yes, the one island per console is sad and warrants loosing a few points, the game is otherwise exactly what you expect from the series. The graphics look great on the switch and are bright and fun with a beautiful island setting, the characters are friendly and cute, and the gameplay is the generic collection and fetching of items that make up animal crossing.

Story there isn’t anything to say as it is mostly just a tending to the island and it’s inhabitants sim, but you don’t buy these games for a gripping story.

JAVN,29-05-2020,"New Horizons is a a great addition to the animal crossing series.....However

So i picked up New Horizons as my first game after buying a switch during lock down, i saw it as a relaxing game to kill a lot of hours to get through the current pandemic, and i want to start by saying that it did exactly that, from the moment i booted the game up i was instantly hooked on the idea of building my island from the ground up and creating the environment i want, from carefully placing items to create cute little Cafes to acquiring my favorite villagers, Animal Crossing seemed to have it all, and after 2 weeks and 175 hours of game play later i was still discovering new items and new little quirks that kept the game compelling and intriguing.

Now however, as great as i just stated the game was, and let me reiterate still is, there are still issues with the game, for a start, Terra forming and overall island customization, i'm honestly surprised this hasn't been touched upon by other reviewers but i personally felt this side of the game incredibly frustrating and lacking in creative freedom, i lost count on the amount of times i went to place down a tree, in plenty of room, only to be told by the game that ""There isn't enough room"" on far too many occasions ideas for island designs where ruined by the games little leg room when it comes to item placing, Now. let me get onto Terra forming, now i'm willing to give the game some leniency in this department, partially because its a rare feature to find implemented in any Nintendo game period, never mind an Animal Crossing game, and while the feature is overwhelmingly well received and massive for giving the players a sense of customization and the ability to really make their island their own....its incredibly clunky, like to the point i almost don't want to use it, i don't know i feel like a lot of Animal Crossings customization features in this game are very limiting, while at the same time giving players the freedom to still do almost anything they desire, its a strange middle ground and one that while frustrating at times, i suppose i still managed to look past when you realize how simplistically charming the rest of the game is.

In conclusion, is Animal Crossing a great game? Yes definitely, is it perfect? No, however with its charming art style, addictive game play, and ability to edit your island to your desire, is it a game that is guaranteed to keep you hooked and checking in every day? definitely",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

Nikg92,02-06-2020,"This game more than lived up to my expectations. Some people are complaining about the one island per console limit and that is valid. At the end of the day, this doesn't affect me as I see the Switch as more of a personal console than a family (shared) console so I personally am fine with this limitation. But on the other hand, save file limitations have been part of the franchise since its inception. You've never been able to store multiple save files (on one medium) for any Animal Crossing game. I'm sure this is meant to encourage sharing a single town for a more genuine and social experience, but some players don't like to be told how to play and I get it.
Almost every aspect of the game is beautiful and amazing. Though, the background music for the island is a bit monotonous and lacks the variety of previous titles. In all past titles, there were always one or more background songs that I genuinely loved but none from this one have really sung to me. Another problem I have with this game is that arranging stacked furniture outside in a particular orientation is cumbersome and sometimes outright impossible. Another final complaint, and I could be wrong here, but it seems like the non-event-specific DIY recipes are granted in a purely random fashion where a weighted random algorithm would likely be more fair and enjoyable to players.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Dwyerr98,19-06-2020,"Been playing this game since launch and was really excited for this game beforehand, at first I was in love with the game and just happy to play a new animal crossing game on switch, I loved the fact we started off with basically nothing and had to work with Tom nook to build up our island, but after completing the little story mode in nook and having played the game for a while it’s not all I thought it would be. First I do love the fact that we have a lot more ways when customising our island such as getting to place and move villager houses, shops and museum and even our own house and the new terraforming tool is great, also really like the idea of crafting our own items and furniture feels like it gives me more things to do in the game itself and helps me when wanting more furniture/ items when doing my island up. Also love getting to go to the NMT islands to find villagers instead of getting a random villager moving in when one moves out. There is also a lot more seasonal events in the game which gives the player a lot more to do in game. Graphics have obviously improved and I actually like the new music in the game, and there is a lot more with character customisation. I feel like they have gone all out with the customisation in the game which I love as I can really be creative with my island But I feel like a have more negatives than positives which is a shame because i was really looking forward to this game. The game has improved in many ways but in others it just lacks a lot, firstly I feel like a lot of the personalities of the villagers just feel the same and they say the same things quite a lot and as soon as you speak to them once they kind of get sick of you if you try again, there is only 2 shops in the game (able sister and nooks cranny) and evening though these shops are good, I feel like we need more shops in the game and the shops we have could me improved so much more, for instance in able sisters when going into the changing room you can only buy a set of clothing and then need to come out and then back into the changing room and rinse and repeat if you want to buy multiple sets, it gets quite annoying after a while, also nooks cranny is lacking I feel like a get a lot of repeat furniture and the shop itself only has one upgrade with is a downgrade from previous games, this game does offer crafting so we can make most stuff ourselves but there’s a lot of furniture you have to buy and also I loved upgrading the shop multiple times as I became a goal for me. The game is either missing previous NPC’s or they are again lacking such as Leif and kicks only showing up every now and again only with a stall with a select amount of items and then the likes of rooster and his shop and a bunch of the ACNL Main Street shops missing with there NPC’s missing. The Nook mile tickets are w good idea but the items you can buy or always the same apart from the fence diys as they change daily, and I feel a lot of the NMT Islands become very similar after a while and don’t really offer anything unless your looking for a villager or a specific rare island but even then I feel like they should offer more, also more of a minor issue but I think we should have more custom design slots, we do have more than what we had in ACNL but still we should have a lot more, I feel like I see so many amazing custom designs online but I can’t use them as I have filled all my slots which custom designs that I am currently using on my island

Also there is another 2 main issues I have with the game first being that there can only be one island per switch so if you share a switch with someone and you both want to play the game you have to play on the same island and only one player can do most of the stuff such as starting the island up when you create it, feel like this is such a step back considering the switch itself feels like its advertised as a family sharing console, also don’t like the fact that there is no cloud saves so if you make an island on one switch you can only play it on that switch, I think they are trying to make a way round this but still annoying

I think a good thing about this game is that the devs are frequently updating the game and adding stuff in to the game bit by bit so a lot of the issues I have could be added in through an update which is good but that’s if they choose to add this stuff into the game and also I feel like some of my issues and things missing from the game shouldn’t of been added through updates they should of been apart of base game Overall I am still enjoying this game a lot but it could be so much more.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
Abuelita,20-07-2020,"Animal Crossing es una experiencia increíble que crece día a día. Nunca antes había jugado algo de la saga y tenía mis dudas porque no sabía cómo un jueguito así me podría divertir: no tiene metas reales sino las que te propongas tú qué básicamente es hacer tu isla y tu casa bonita. Pues resulta que es mágico, es un juego hermoso que te enamora cada día. Llevo más de 210 horas jugadas y sigo queriendo más. Cada actualización le da mas vida al juego y siempre hay cosas qué hacer, a pesar que ya hayas alcanzado las famosas 5 estrellas.

Los residentes de la isla son mis amigos y, de un tiempo acá, decidimos que íbamos a dejarlos ir cuando se quisieran ir, y es doloroso porque los voy a extrañar. El mundo que hay fuera que hacen los que juegan este juego es maravilloso y es que te contagia la buena vibra de alguna forma. Quieres ayudar a todos, ser amigos, conocer islas.

El apartado técnico está muy bien: los gráficos son súper bonitos, la música es un espectáculo, un gran 10, la jugabilidad está bien, adecuada para lo que se requiere. Luego está la lentitud del juego, pero creo que es parte de la experiencia.

El juego no es perfecto. Tiene errores muy puntuales que los corregirían con tan poco, pero creo que no quieren corregirlo: 1ro: una sola isla para todos. Vamos que esto debería ser una opción y no una imposición, pero la verdad es que va con el rollo del juego de todo bonito y tal, de compartir, pero quita la experiencia al segundo jugador. 2do: el online es tan mediocre y fastidioso que uno se lo tiene que pensar antes de visitar a una isla o recibir visitas. “Alguien está llegando a tu isla”.

sham0us,20-06-2020,"Animal Crossing is a very fun game to play, mostly in the beginning. First off you're first two islanders are not totally random as the male will always be a Jock villager and the female will always be an Uchi villager. So in those regards if you're favorite villager is in one of those two categories then you could just keep soft resetting until you get one of them. Now there is a lot to do once you begin like fishing and catching bugs for your museum, but there is a lot of halt in progress in trying to get materials once you need to open the shop and it is expected in Animal Crossing that you will need to wait for it to open. There's really no problem with this and if you can't really wait just time travel a day ahead if you really don't wanna wait, it just depends on how you want to play. Now as of now it seems like a just long halt waiting for something new to happen. Of course since it's now June there is a lot more fish and bugs you're able to catch so that can give you something to do, but what happens when you catch everything you need? It seems like a cycle of just waiting for something new to come or just hoping a new event will happen soon, but besides that right now we need some quality of life changes. Like being able to access materials from home, people able to craft multiple things at once, etc. We got an upgraded inventory and it still feels small having to hold all these materials around all the time. Now moving on the topic of villagers, at least now you don't have to worry about a villager moving away on you randomly since they will always ask if they should leave or not, but it does get a little repetitive talking to them because they mostly say the same things all the time and if you have two of the same personality types of two villagers, you're not seeing double, you're seeing the same dialogue. But besides that, they are at least very interactive now and don't just walk around aimlessly doing nothing. On to the topic of online, since I only really play with one person it doesn't work that badly, but when in a group of people it could be very annoying seeing someone arrive every 5 minutes and having to wait through the loading time. Besides that, it doesn't really feel like there's much to do online, it just feels like you're doing your basic activities but on someone else's island. Sure you could come up with some mini games to play with your friends, that's always an idea, but that's not content from the game. That's you coming up with your own ideas of how to make the game fun. As of right now the game feels very stale, and just waiting around for something new to do isn't very exciting, hopefully we get some new content soon because as of right now everything just feels repetitive.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

PhantomAgony,21-06-2020,"Para mí es el mejor juego de la saga sin duda. He jugado desde Wild World, y las posibilidades que ofrece New Horizons son una maravilla. Siento que han escuchado a los fans, que antes hacíamos caminos y personalizábamos el pueblo con diseños, al implementar el terraforming. Que puedan ponerse muebles en todo el exterior hace que tu isla pueda ser única, es la evolución que esperaba de la saga, la que siempre deseé. Además, hay muchísimas opciones de ropa y personalización del personaje. Los cambios por estaciones son geniales, los gráficos son bonitos, la música es relajante, la sensación al jugarlo es muy agradable. Siento que tengo un lugar al que huir del estrés.
No le doy un diez por algunas cosas: no me gusta encontrarme casi siempre los mismos muebles en la tienda, de los mismos colores, ni que me den casi siempre las mismas recetas. Por otro lado, las conversaciones con los vecinos se hacen un poco repetitivas. Las introducciones de Canela son tan repetitivas y aburridas que las paso sin leerlas, lo más rápido posible. Y aunque no viajo en el tiempo (me parece que cada uno puede jugar como le plazca), no me gusta depender de las actualizaciones para tener el juego completo, en mi casa el internet no es bueno y muchas veces no tengo siquiera conexión. Por otra parte, decir que es normal que sólo se pueda tener una isla por juego, en todos los Animal Crossing sólo puedes tener un pueblo por juego, es exactamente lo mismo. Lo que no me parece bien es que la isla esté ligada a la consola, lo veo un gran error. Si compras otro juego, deberías tener otra isla, que para eso lo has pagado.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

ditrobix,24-06-2020,"Un juego que viene de maravilla en estos tiempos de cuarentena.
Adictivo a más no poder, ayuda a sociabilizar con otras personas aún en distancia y posee jugador local, aunque al final los invitados son como los esclavos del dueño de la isla XD supongo que se hizo así para que no dejaran la cagadita en la isla y lo cual tiene sentido, pasaba lo mismo con New Leaf. Así que no comprendo a esa gente que se queja de ""un rey, 7 esclavos"" evidentemente jamás jugaron un animal crossing... o se trata de un anti nintendo que le molesta saber que este juego tiene muchisimo potencial y no en sus juegos de su consola favorita.

Interesante eso de poder decorar sin necesidad de trámites en el uso de muebles tanto interior como exterior de tu casa, lo cuál abre la puerta a más posibilidades.

El único aspecto negativo del juego lamentablemente cae en lo más importante del juego. Los condenados animales del AC.
¿Por qué?
Porque al parecer los desarrolladores estaban más ocupados en hacerle caso a lo que pedían los youtubers que en su vida habían tocado el juego ni con un palo y por mera moda pedían cosas como más gente en el online, que estoy en un 100% seguro que no todos lo usan a full. Basta que uno tenga mal conexión y toda la diversión termina en el tacho de basura.

Nuevamente los animales se sienten como bots, que dependiendo de su naturaleza gruñona o feliz, etc, siempre dirán lo mismo. Por lo cual es decepcionante. Estamos hablando de más de 300 animales y fallan en la profundidad de dichos, cosas que en juegos anteriores si poseían e incluso secretos de cada uno, que acá son inexistentes, al menos en todo el tiempo que lo llevo jugando.

Por eso nada más le ha costado llevarse el último punto para llegar al 10, en algo que debiera ser primordial, hacer más ""natural"" en los animales y que no se sientan como bots.

Muchas gracias youtubers caquitas que piden cosas demasiado estúpidas, sólo para hacer que más gente participe en sus directos que más que seguro ya ni usan.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

BetaAthe,26-06-2020,"Veo que uno de los problemas que se comenta en toda review es la funcionalidad de una isla por consola. Hijos míos, esto lleva funcionando así, por lo menos, desde el Wild World. No sé cuál es la sorpresa.

El juego tiene una calidad gráfica y sonora sublime. Las animaciones están pulidas y se nota que Nintendo le quiere ponerle mimo al juego al comprometerse a ir actualizándolo a medida que pase el tiempo.

Como contras diré lo siguiente: La cantidad de objetos del juego es escasa, a mi parecer. Los eventos semanales son bastante repetitivos: Que si viene Gandulio, que si viene CJ, que si vuelve a venir Gandulio... Sin embargo, no me quejo tanto de que vengan de vez en cuando estos personajes, sino de que resulta realmente difícil que venga Ladino.

Como detalle neutral diré lo siguiente: El sistema de edición física de la isla es increíble, pero se hecha en falta poder hacer puentes sobre terrenos y no sólo sobre ríos, o el poder hacer túneles, al cavar una sección de tierra bajo otra, etc.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

The part that multiple people share the same island on the same console is something that all the games in the series have done, I share an island with 3 other people and we are all satisfied.

I love the amount of customization avaliable and how you and your friends' islands and residents will always be wholely unique.

After six months of playing on my 5-star island, I do have to admit I've run out of things to do. I only log in once in a while to fill out my catalogue, say hello to my favorite neighbors, or the occasional new idea project that arises. I do really admire how Nintendo puts out monthly updates to keep you interested, though I haven't really found any of them to be super substantial besides the swimming update. I would've liked more quality-of-life improvements to make crafting and decorating more seamless, or even some multiplayer additions. It's always fun to visit my friends' islands and vice versa, though visiting is really the only extent as you can't build or play games together. My time with the game now is more pleasant than it is life-drainingly engaging. But it's hardly something I can really fault the game for, because I put over 170 hours into it! Most games I can't even break 30 hours before I'm tired of it.

I know I'll never be done with it, even if I don't play it as much now. And I know, I'll be eating up any new Animal Crossing games should they ever make another. For now, I'll keep holding out for a multiple islands update or some multiplayer minigames.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Kimichii,05-07-2020,"Animal Crossing New Horizons still has the charm of the old games. So many things that the developers have kept the same - with some minor changes.
I was really excited when the game came out and I played it for about one month straight. I know that this AC is mainly targeting new players, but all in all many things just are a little bit too easy.
I've filled the fossils in the museum after around 60 days of playing. When I think of Wild World and New Leaf, this felt way too quick. Also to pay your house and all other expenses to Tom Nook was really easy.
What I really like is the new interaction of the villagers, how they are not just simply walking around anymore, but do different kind of actions, they react to the environment and with each other. This is incredibly cute and makes them feel much more lively.
Even though the developers announce new updates and tried to slow the progress of the game down with the different waiting times for e.x. the museum, the excitement for this game burnt down rather quick.
Additionally, I am really bummed about the furniture. There is so much less than in New Leaf and so many sets were thrown out... resulting in always getting the same kind of furniture in Balloons, Trees, the Nook Cranny and so on. And this is kinda frustrating.
I personally think they did this so you visit other islands more often, but for me Animal Crossing is a game to relax and often I just want to play for myself.
Still, I am playing Animal Crossing almost daily, as I am excited for the visitors and now with the Summer Update, I love swimming around and collecting more sea life. But I am not playing as much anymore as I was used to. Often I just do the dailys like collecting miles or the DIY recipe (which never results in a new DIY) and that's it.

BTW: Everyone who hates on ""there is just one island"" has never played an Animal Crossing before - and it shows. They always just had one city for one game. That this wouldn't be different on the Switch was obvious. Just inform yourself correctly and don't blame the game for it.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

Me and my wife spent ~140h on this game, and we like to share the same island so show/visit each other houses, give items, etc..

I think this game really lacks coop/multiplayer. So many times I wanted to play with someone and we end up facing each other doing emotes/reactions but chatting on discord/whatsapp.

Plus I’m sure more activities and content will be added in overtime. The graphics are good for a switch game and overall the game is very relaxing , charming and addictive.

They could invite you over, have parties, actually be rude, and even give you tasks. In this you walk around, catch bugs, and earn money. That’s all there is to do. Gone is the interesting gameplay. But even the crapiest of games has some good. While I am playing the story based part of the game I had a grand old time. Tom Nook is actually pretty funny, and it’s fun. The rest is boring.

Yah, I guess having 1 island shared between two or more users is a downer, but no one has explored the idea to create an expansive island, with CRAZY HOMES. If Nintendo could make 1 change, I'd request for villagers to have multi level homes that you could customize. The game has reached a point, after 1-2 months, where you're limited to only the Island itself + your home, as the sandbox. Giving control and additional creative freedom within villager homes would, imo, stay true to animal crossing whilst allowing players to appreciate their villagers more so, than simply gifting.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

While the game is being bombarded with 0 star reviews for the one island per console, which is stupid I agree, but apparently they had something similar in New Leaf, and that doesn't get bombarded. Why? I guess it's because that was less of a shared console, and it wasn't quarantine. Or maybe people darling New Leaf because it's nostalgic for them. So I find the criticism really unfair. I play it every day, and I've grown so attached. I love decorating the island, hanging out with my villagers, and just soaking in the atmosphere. I've played for 250 hours and I'm still not in any way bored with it, and don't see myself stopping any time soon, as I haven't nearly done all there is to do. I haven't gotten a 5 star island and I haven't completed the museum. Routine is cool and all, but every day feels like a new adventure to me, not to mention the upcoming updates, which I'm really excited for. This game is one of the few things where I trust the critic score over the user score. Highly recommended.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

dartimos,22-09-2020,"I've specifically made an account on MetaCritic to warn people off from this game.

There is a feature in the game called ""Primary Player."" This player is the only one who is able to make progress in the game. There is no way to make another island for other players. There is no way to transfer power outside deleting the island and restarting.

If you are buying this for a family, don't.

Let's talk about dysfunctional relationships. They are often caused by unilateral decisions and lack of communication.

The decision to have a primary player is a unilateral decision by the developers despite complaints. It leads to unilateral decisions by the primary player placing their wants and needs over the ""secondary"" players.

There is no warning for this. There is no documentation of this. The only way you find are are reviews and comments online. In other words, no communication. Not only that, but it creates a communication inequality within the family. The ""lead"" player makes the decisions. They can listen to other players, but they don't need to. The other players can suggest ideas, but there's no way to delegate or enable other players.

The game both practices and fosters dysfunctional relationships. Both between designer and player as well as within the family.

I gave it a zero because my family cannot play the game. I bought it for my family. It is worth zero to me. If they fix it, or you play it solo, I'd probably give it an 8-10 dependent on later content that I was unable to reach due to the Primary Player bug.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

TheComplexWolf,27-10-2020,"I’ve been playing Animal Crossing: New Horizons since release day and it’s definitely saved me during these difficult months.

One big update in the latest Animal Crossing game is the ability to transform your island. The terraforming aspect really adds to the game and gives you endless possibilities when it comes to decorating your island. You can build your own decorations and furniture with materials you find, which help towards the goal of reaching a 5* island.

The villagers within the game are as adorable as always. An added bonus is that your villagers no longer leave without warning, so you can technically keep your favourite villagers on your island for as long as possible. You can also go out hunting for your next villager which is a fun element.

The regular updates keep players hooked to the game, particularly the seasonal updates such as Easter, Halloween, etc. Seasonal updates gives you additional goals to work towards which brings you back to the game yet again.

Whilst I always return to New Horizons regularly, I’ve found that in recent months that I spend less and less time playing as I’ve run out of things to do on my island, which is a shame. There’s always the possibility of redecorating your island, but once you’ve finalised your design then it becomes difficult to find tasks to do to keep yourself busy.

Another negative that seems quite small, but can become quite frustrating, is the lack of storage. Usually it wouldn’t be a huge issue, however when one big element of the game is to craft items to use across your island, having nowhere to store your materials over time causes you to dump items on your island, bringing the rating down. This is disheartening over time when you can no long aim for a 5* island due to items being dropped on the ground.

All in all, Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a lovely, relaxing game that keeps you coming back for more. The game could easily be a 10/10 game if some of the small frustrations were fixed.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

La historia es tremendamente simple pero sirve como tutorial para empezar a jugar; y el multijugador con amigos puede hacer del juego una experiencia espectacular. Además, la hora del juego se ajusta a la de la realidad, algo que puede ser bueno, par dividir las horas entre distintos días, o malo, ya que te ""obliga"" a conectarte para obtener los beneficios de cada día.

I would probably never have bought this game if it was to play with my friends or roommate (if I had one).

When I compare the first AC on GCN to this one, we can clearly see that there are improvements (fortunately, lol). But even if every single details are nice, I'm kinda worried that the interest will wear out in a month or two. Like every AC games. Which is sad because they really could find ways to update it and make it more enjoyable to play, with significant updates like in MMO games. But we know Nintendo, it's never going to be the case. We are going to have cheap updates every 4 months for Valentine, Halloween, Christmas, etc... and that's it.

Wrecktangled,17-03-2022,The love Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon type games. So i thought for sure this would be right up my alley. Turned out to be way too tedious and felt more like chores than anything else. The relationships werent engaging enough me either. Maybe this game requires a bit more creativity out of the player than I was willing to bring to the table. But overall it left me feeling disappointed.,3,ACNH,METACRITIC
B0JHorseman,27-04-2021,"People basing their entire reviews on the single aspect of only being able to create one island per game is ridiculous, and the fact that Animal Crossing New Horizons has a user review of 5.5 almost solely because of this issue is just angering to me. This game would almost certainly have a score of 9.0 if you all weren't so petty. While I agree it is frustrating, since you can't even create an additional island if you bought a second copy, (since it saves to the device and not to the game itself) but this is not new. It's been like this in every version of the game that has been released. Animal Crossing has always been an extremely innovative, fun, and relaxing game. I've played every game since the first American version on the GameCube, and each release is better than the last. Always with more things to do than the one before it. If you haven't played an Animal Crossing game yet, I would strongly recommend you ignore the poorly thought out reviews, and try it for yourself. Take some time to read the reviews of previous versions, or listen to fans of the games to hear about all the fun you can have. Animal crossing is great in the way that it gives you a reason to come on and play everyday throughout the year.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
HydraBenny,06-04-2021,"Got this for my 4 year old daughter and Im helping her read it and get set up. My 8 year old son wanted to have a go since it's his switch and daughter was happy for him to make his own island and play it sometimes. Only issue is you are only allowed to make one island... Ever. I don't want him playing her island and rushing past the tutorials as she needs the help to understand what to do.

So until nintendo make the simple addition of multiple save slots ie like every Mario game they've ever made, then the rating will have to be a 0 due to the problems this decision has made for us. Kids aren't happy.",0,ACNH,METACRITIC

R_Snoops,26-06-2021,"This game was suppose to be the savior of this pandemic. Nintendo said, they would update this game for years. but i cant see that happening. when it released, you weren't even able to swim. on an island setting.... so that they fixed that with an update was just a must. all events are just the same with different settings. the rewards are meaningless and don't serve anything of value. it is simply aweful that you have to get all the furniture with DIYs from balloons and villagers and so on. you get way too many duplicates. its absolutely not fun. beeing forced to go in online forums and look for someone who maybe has a needed DIY. the shops are absolutely small. they offer so little products. its annoying. you can craft in bulk its just annoying. many things of this game are just there to take ages. just like the terraforming. but the devs had to make it as annoying and time consuming as possible for every single chore. because the game has absolutely nothing to offer gameplay wise. you cant do anything with friends. no minigames. no nothing. you are forced to make your own imaginary games. i simply cant understand how this game has a perfect score from official media. this game is incredibly shallow. all villager say the same everyday. they don't have any character. they are not interesting at all. have nothing to say. the game lacks so many features, furniture, events and gameplay from past games. the game still haven't got an update 2.0. its been over a year now and they still didn't implement anything of value to the game. all they do is recycle events and bring some more seasonal items to the game. they basically don't update the game at all til now. for over a year since release. (because the last big thing was the ability to swim. and this was simply a must. and even that wasn't even a new thing -.-)

and one more annoying thing... they don't listen to the community at all. they ignore everything. so its just worse that they make twitter posts on a regular basis everytime they implement another meaningless item. or recycle an event again. they got their money and now they just don't give a damn about this game anymore or their fans. oh and the multiplayer is just the worst. there is absolutely nothing positive about it. but that was expected. Nintendo has no skill for online experiences. they screw up every single multiplayer ever.

to end this review on a more positive note... there are some good things. the graphic is pleasing and the soundtrack is great. good for chilling. the rest of the game is nothing but a dumpster fire.

tl;dr
pros:
- soundtrack
- graphics
- nostalgia

cons:
- gameplay
- NPC AI
- crafting
- gameplay
- all the time wasting gameplay mechanics
- all the small shops
- all the missing shops and villager from the past
- all the missing furniture from the past
- gameplay
- no minigames
- online multiplayer
- only one island per switch console
- the ticket islands are just boring and repeat way too often and look all the same
- items break way too quick with no indication
- gameplay
- building, placing and terraforming is very very imprecise and clunky
- all events are recycled and the rewards are bad.
- getting all the stuff from redd is just the worst. it can easily happen that you wont see him for month!!
- gameplay
- and basically everything else which makes games, games.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
gabsprado,08-07-2021,"The game is pretty mediocre, the graphics looks astoundingly beautiful and minimalistic, but that's pretty much it. Content-wise it has less content than indie games like Stardew Valley that costs six times less and it's miles better. Animal Crossing: New Horizons is severely lacking if compared to the previous ones, a lot of NPCs and shops were cut out, the villagers interactions are pretty dull and becomes repetitive pretty fast, the numbers of buildings went from 13 (New Leaf) to a baffling 4 in New Horizons. Also they got out with some pretty nasty and scammy decisions that tainted the experience for me like for example:

-One island per console. If you want to create another island, buying another copy of the game isn't enough, you'd literally have to buy another $300 console

-The game released pretty unfinished, and they got out with it by saying they would implement free updates. Well, one year later and those updates proved to be VERY underwhelming and repetitive (literally every holiday event is: collect this item on the map, trade it for furniture, repeat). And even after one whole year the game is still severely lacking compared to previous ones or the microtransaction one (Pocket Camp)

-Some RNGs in the game are pretty much broken, my art museum is still pretty much empty because the Redd boat was programmed to almost never show up in the Island, so unless you're willing to time travel (which shouldn't even be a feature) you'll probably never gonna complete your museum collection.

-After, like, two weeks playing the game you'll probably =burn out everything the game has to offer and the only thing left for you to do is to check the holiday events that, again, is pretty much the same thing with a new skin.

-The mini-games, common in every Animal Crossing entry, are non-existent in this one.

-Brewster, Tortimer and Kapp'n aren't in the game and probably won't be added

-The gyroids, also common in every entry, are also non-existent in this one

-The game is probably abandoned by Nintendo at this point and won't have updates anymore.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC
metasupra2344,22-08-2021,"This is a fun, relaxing game. The crafting mechanic is fun for a little bit. It gets tiresome crafting the same thing while spamming the A button (especially to make fish bait). I wish that they had a craft all button or something like that. The main reason for this low score is because of the ""one island per console"" move that Nintendo pulled when they released this game. It's such a scummy move. They also had a bunch of features cut that were present in New Leaf cut only to bring them back in a later update. This was also perhaps the first time Redd wasn't in the base game at launch. Also the tool breaking function is really annoying especially when you're in ""the late game."" There really isn't a benefit to getting golden tools like in the previous games. The golden tools break in this game which kind of feels like a slap in the face especially for the amount of work you need to do to get the golden tools.

Overall this game is really fun and I enjoyed it. Annoyances aside, Nintendo's scummy implementation of game mechanics brought the rating down from a 8 to 10 to a 4.",4,ACNH,METACRITIC

Boosher,04-08-2021,"When I first got my hands on animal Crossing new horizons I spent almost every awake minute on it.. Building my village from scratch it was very enjoyable and I found myself spending way too much time on it.

However I actually stopped playing the game after the Holloween patch I felt it was starting to get very bland and very boring real fast yes.. this could be because I did play the crap out of it but it was the similar situation on the Nintendo 3DS where I found myself playing for long period of time and then just figuring out that is quite boring and that’s coming from a guy who spent 200 hours+ on the game.

All in all Animal crossing new horizons is a great game to start off your Nintendo journey however play for as long as you like you don’t necessarily need to pay for the rest of your life but I do recommend you play it up to a certain point. A point where you’re happy with your village and everything is going smoothly. To which then you can probably move on to another game. The reason why I didn’t give it 10 out of 10 is.. I feel like Nintendo has started to throw in elements which aren’t really related to the animal Crossing franchise they just do it for the fan base or an excuse to hype gamers into playing it again.

I might or might not find myself playing it in the future that’s disappointing because I love animal Crossing. Also it has become even more bland as people have started to cheat and started selling Animal crossing items, money, tickets etc on the Internet which ultimately made the game even more dull as obtaining items have become meh.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
Bloxed,16-08-2021,"The game suffers from being a sequel to New Leaf and also trying to be a Minecraft alternative.

New Leaf was an amazing game, one of my favourites of all time. My first year of playing, I managed to sink in over 500 hours. The game added so much, improved upon so much, it was one of my favourite video games of all time!

Then imagine my excitement when it was revealed a new Animal Crossing was coming to Switch. I was over-joyed! I was thinking about all the new possibilities, the new features, how it expands off of New Leaf! The trailer came in for February 2020, and then my hype was slightly narrowed down when they revealed Crafting... I was concerned at the time, however soon my concern would turn into a nightmare when I got the game on March 20th. I put the game in my Switch and was having a blast, however instead of what happened with New Leaf, where the game lasted me over half a year before I felt the need to take an extended break, it only took me just over a month to think that New Horizons should have been avoided. My Nightmares became true. The crafting was almost everything the game centred around, and it wasn't fun. Many objectives I was given, wether for Nook Miles or because of some Tom Nook stuff early on in the game, felt tedious rather than fun, like I didn't actually want to get these and look for these, but instead I felt an obligation to so then I could complete the game.

Then when I eventually got far in the game, I begun waiting for updates, because there were numerous issues the game faced. No Roost, No Shampoodle, No Re-Tail, no Shops besides Nook's Cranny and Able Sisters. The game was empty in features, and I sat down in my seat during every Direct, every trailer, hoping for a new building to be revealed. The realisation came in around Autumn, these were never going to come. The game was doomed to be a dissappointment.

The game was the first dissappointing Animal Crossing experience for me. I first started with City Folk / Let's Go To The City, and I loved it to death! Then I played Wild World for a short bit. Despite being a downgrade from the first game even, I still thoroughly enjoyed it for a more laid-back feeling, like you don't have to worry about coming on time for events as much, and you could go at your own pace, and it would still be fun. Then I played New Leaf, and like I said, one of my favourite games of all time, with City Folk / Let's Go To The City not far behind. Then I played the First game a few months after getting New Leaf, loved the game to death as well. Notice how all of the prior games to New Horizons, I loved playing like they were the only games I had in my collection. Hell, I even enjoyed Happy Home Designer and Amiibo Festival, and have started 2 towns for every game in the series, except for one... New Horizons...

New Horizons wasn't fun, and generally it was a mediocre - bad experience. It lacked the soul and features of other game, so you might as well buy those ones and their respective consoles instead, even if it costs more, it's still more worthy of the £50 - $60 price tag slapped on this, at best £20 - $25 experience.

MutedGoose,22-12-2021,"First I would like to say this was my first animal crossing game and that i didn't have a problem with having one island per switch, but i defiantly understand that for some people it can be frustrating. Therefore this review will strictly be about how i found the actual game and its fun factor.

For my first animal crossing game i was excited, I understood what kind of game it was and I was intrigued. So I got it and for the first few days i was really enjoying myself, activities like fishing and designing my house was really fun. But thats really it over the next week or two i started to realise everyday i losing motivation to do any of these tasks and that's because they are very boring and tedious. Tedium was mainly what drew me away from the game, everything is just so slow for some reason. Crafting, digging, collecting weeds etc. all take so much time to do making whatever payout that you are getting diminish. I felt I was doing these tasks for no reason but to grow my village and have to deal with more of these issues. I had a dream of making a perfect island filled with cool characters as that was how the game was marketed, but progression is so slow; taking days to build houses, bridges and inclines meaning that dream of mine was hundreds of hours away. Why would a game make something so interesting so inaccessible for a majority of gamers.

Im a huge fan of Nintendo, but this game was boring but even when i had something to do it was bland, tedious and more of the stuff i had been doing for the past three weeks. Not to mention I never felt satisfied with the payoff for hours of work. Maybe coming from a similar game like Minecraft really impacted my thoughts on the game.",2,ACNH,METACRITIC

francisjairam12,24-03-2021,"First things first let me just be clear here. I've been playing this game since the day it first came on March 20, 2020 so I have seen every single thing that the game has to offer. I do not hate New Horizons its still a good game despite the flaws it has. So anyways I feel stuck on what to do next? I completed my museum (all fossils, sea creatures, bugs, fish, statues, and paintings), terraformed my island the way I wanted it to be, and got the villagers that I wanted so now I am just asking myself ""what do I do now?"". This question has been bothering me for the longest time.

I seen all the events and they were fun for the time and whenever there was new stuff added I would be interested and try it out and then after about a day I get bored so quickly. I try to motivate myself to keep playing daily but it just doesn't feel good anymore. I have a lot of Nook Miles which I probably am not going to use given that I already finished hunting for villagers using nook mile tickets and I got amiibo cards last year. I guess what I'm trying to say is the game just feels stale and really lacks longevity. If anyone asks I did time travel. Only because it just took too long to like order stuff from the Nook Shopping and you are forced to wait a day until it comes tomorrow which was getting pretty annoying. I did the same thing when first building bridges and inclines when I was still making my island last year.

Ihis game feels like a Happy Home Designer 2.0 where it focus a lot more on designing rather than building a community. I try to feel more relax in New Horizons but because of how terrible the Villager dialogue is I just cannot do it.

Happyspelling,24-11-2020,"I was super exited for this game when it was first announced. Animal Crossing is my favorite video game series. The wait was brutal, but was it worth it in the end? I'd say it is! The graphics look pretty nice, the music is cheery and relaxing, and the villagers are even more enjoyable than in previous games! This game isn't perfect though. It doesn't actually become like Animal Crossing for 10-20 hours. The good news is it's still fun during the beginning. The whole crafting mechanic is really only for those early hours. Once I livened up my island (cleverly named Island), I rarely ever crafted after that. I don't appreciate how desperate it is to be different from the rest of the series, because I really miss some of the old characters. I do love the new ones, and at least Dr. Shrunk isn't in this game... But I did have some problems. For one thing, why is there still a 10 villager limit? The first game had 15! Island is big enough to fit a few extra people (or animals)! I'd even settle for 12! Also when you use a Nook Miles ticket to visit a deserted island? It's a really cool idea, but the island is way too tiny, so there's nothing to do, and a villager will only appear there when your town isn't full. I really want to get some of the new villagers, but I can't when it's restricting your opportunities. Granted, I was lucky enough to find Judy, a new cub, on an island, but that was after farming like 10 tickets! Also, there have only been 8 new villagers shown at this point! Are those the only new ones? I mean, I really like them, but that's just pitiful. The amiibo functionality is good too, but the crossover villagers from Welcome Amiibo aren't in this game! I miss Inkwell... Also you just have to get extremely lucky to get a new villager. I really want Cyd the elephant and Raymond the cat in my town, but there's no amiibo for them... I'm suprised that I was able to talk about the negatives for so long... Now on to the positives! Let me just say I haven't been this happy playing a video game since...maybe never. This might be the happiest game ever made. I bet it could cure depression (I'm serious)! The characters in this game are way cuter and funnier here than in any other Animal Crossing game. Everyone has their favorite one/ones, but this gave me several new favorites, and I love my old favorites even more! This game also has a lot of funny dialogue (maybe more than Paper Mario: Color Splash). This game has so much personality, and I love it! Its just so much fun! Even pulling weeds is fun now! This game is my 3rd favorite Animal Crossing game, my 4th favorite Switch game, and is probably in my top 20 games of all time! It really satisfied my expectations. It was pretty much exactly as good as I thought it would be. Most games nowadays are either slightly better or slightly worse than you expect it to be. The delays and stuff were really painful, but it was worth the wait, and every Switch owner needs this game!

For example, if you have a stack of say 40 weeds and you would like to take 20 to sell them you have to separate one by one until you have 20 additional single weeds in your inventory and after that you have to put them together to a 20 piece stack. Letting you click at least 60 times to do that. There are plenty of other such instances. It is just Ridiculous!",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
hknyrbkn,16-03-2021,"So I had written another review where I gave Animal Crossing: New Horizons a score of 10. On the anniversary of the game, I lower it back to 5 as the developers did NOT deliver the updates that they had promised. The game is barren, and nothing changed since last March when the game launched. For a long-term game like ACNH, this is unacceptable. Update by update, it just got more boring.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

IkOzael,10-06-2021,"As someone who's gotten into Animal Crossing through Pocket Camp among other things, I enjoy playin' this game way more (even though this series would be right at home on a phone now), but it has many flaws and lacks a ton of things.

For one, the villagers should have their own unique personality to set 'em apart from each other. They're a main part of this little series, yet there's nothing interesting about 'em other than appearance. Personality-wise, there's zero distinction between, say, Beau and Puck for example. In general, you give a villager a gift, they mindlessly accept it as the best thing ever. The only reason to ever get attached to a villager comes down to their looks, not really what they say and it makes 'em bland. They never show any emotion other than absolute happiness. It's feels like a utopia (which I ironically wanted to name my island at one point). Everything is supposedly so perfect and no one ever has anything to talk about other than positive vibes only. It feels so feels artificial. By the way... I don't think it would hurt to have romance. It is fictional and the villagers have anthropomorphic qualities.

Anyway, special characters aren't much better. The Able Sisters, specifically Sable, is the only one of the three with any kind of interesting dialog and that ain't sayin' a lot. Now that I think about it... STOP with the non-existent conversation trees. Everyone blasted the hell outta Pokémon Sword & Shield for the same thing (if you could even call it that), but of all games, Animal Crossing should be actually doing it. What's the point of choosing dialog when it either amounts to nothin' or has the same outcome as the other choice. Anyway, there's another thing that annoys me: the island sandbox. Why is it that every game uses this formulaic Minecraft-like ""world"" layout (actually, that would be insulting Minecraft's world generation since it's actually vast compared to Animal Crossing's hub world generation)? It'd be really nice if they designed an actual world instead of just ""Hey, there's this new thing happening right now. Here's your new home. Have a good life!"". Oh, and why don't villager homes expand? It'd be pretty cool if they also invited you to their homes for whatever reason. I could imagine Muffy inviting me to a sleepover or Beau and Puck wanting me to watch TV together.

Another reason I'm mixed on this game is that I wish there were more activities to do instead of the same fishin', bug catchin', shell collectin', fossil huntin', flower planting, and island designing that's been in every game. With all these props in the game, you'd think you could interact with more than a handful of 'em in a more interesting way. Y'know, something akin to those two 3DS minigames from New Leaf, but expand that to certain items. Maybe have villagers occasionally challenge you to a match? Also, I think the game should really move on from the overhead view. It'd be nice to see everything with a free camera. It's aesthetically dull when every building or object is or has to be oriented forward to work with the overhead view.

I almost never use local multiplayer since I do thing on my own in this game and people got me covered on why online is lame.

It's dumb how cloud saves weren't a thing from the start (even though the way it is still kinda ass). Is cheating really that big of a problem in a game where you create your own experience? Are you serious? It'd be one thing if somethin' like this was runnin' rampant online in multiplayer games, but come on. If people rather stick to the legit way of playin', that's their decision. If people rather put their time into moddin' the game to speed up the progress or whatever, that's their decision. Simple. Whether they regret it or not in the long run is on them. Or god forbit someone simply wanted to have fun changing stuff on their game, affecting no one in the process.

I like this franchise, but there's a LOT of room for improvement; I didn't talk about all the problems or thoughts I had on this game and the series as a whole. Maybe some of the game's issues will be patched. I'm not optimistic though. The day this series upgrades from being a budget version of The Sims is the day I can truly call it good",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

Весь геймплей это гринд - руби деревья, собирай всякое добро с пляжа или в лесу, сажай огород, и рыбачь. И все это сильно бесит уже через час, тк каждое действие сопровождается 5ти секундной нескипаемой анимацией. Кроме того из-за невозможности вращать камерой многие объекты в игре невозможно разглядеть ( в том же stardew valley деревья становятся прозрачными когда ты заходишь за них), что вызывает невозможность нормально с ними взаимодействовать.

Sounds and graphics are what they are, cute and colourful. As basic as it is, the overall atmosphere created by the aesthetics makes for a relaxing experience. And it needs to be relaxing as the game-play is the same as it has been in the past (with a few more features thrown in). You will spend the whole time grinding away to upgrade your house and your little island, all the while customising everything to your taste. Nothing more to say really, there is plenty of content and it's all what you make of it.

chrischaos,27-09-2021,"Animal Crossing New Horizons is just as addictive as ever. The visuals are improved and the core gameplay is engaging if you're looking for a relaxing experience. However, the game isn't without some major flaws.

I'm not a big fan of the loading times to get into the game. You sit through a load to get to the title screen, then another to be greeted by Isabelle, followed by another load screen to finally start playing the game. It's unacceptable that it takes longer to load into ACNH than it takes to load into a massive game like Breath of the Wild.

Also, there's the big issue of ""One island per console"". This would've been made a little better if it were possible to change the ""main player"" after starting an island. I wonder how many people started with one primary player who no longer has any interest in playing. Now you're faced with the choice of continuing with your limited experience or starting over and losing everything.

jordanlearmonth,24-07-2020,"Animal Crossing. An international video game franchise that has impacted the lives of millions. The brand new follow up game has been released. I mean, when I went to go get my copy of this game, I waited in line for at least half an hour. But guess what? It was 110% worth it! I would have waited 2 hours in line if that meant I could wrap my hands around this mysterious wonder! It is such a peaceful, violence free, fantastic game that is great for anyone of any age. Today, I’m going to tell you how much of a great game Animal Crossing: New Horizons is. Without further ado, let’s get right into it!

First, you need to know what Animal Crossing: New Horizons is all about. It starts off with you, buying the Deserted Island Getaway Package. You are dropped off at a completely deserted island along with a few other random villagers. What I mean by villagers is talking animals which each have completely different personalities! For example, Jitters, the green duck who can never get enough exercise. He even dreams about running thousands of miles a day without stopping. Or Bubbles, the hippo always wearing dresses who can never stop talking about becoming a pop star. The island starts out covered in weeds and is swarming with bugs. All you and your fellow islanders have are tents with radios but as you progress, your island does too. You and other villagers begin to live in houses which you can customize to the very last piece of furniture. A museum is forged which displays fossils, art, fish and bugs that you gather. A convenience store is built where you can sell almost anything for some extra cash. The tailor shop is made which sells the finest of clothing. A town hall is installed which provides all necessary help and information to make an island that suits you! Every time I show my mom this game, she falls asleep because of the beautiful songs that the birds sing and the image of a tree’s leaves getting rustled by the gusting wind,which leads me to my next point. The audio is so realistic and the visuals are calming, colorful and just a pleasure to glance at. This game is set with real time so when it’s dark out in real life, the shooting stars rain from the dark night sky in this never ending story. Plus, you will never get bored! There are always things to do like do favors for villagers, make some paths or even expand your house! The amount of lively energy that was poured into this amazing creation is incredible! Islanders now send you mail, do yoga in front of the town hall, talk to each other about starting bands and even doing daily activities like fishing. Even for people who don’t like video games, you should give this beautiful piece of art a shot! I guarantee you will enjoy every last minute of it! Animal Crossing: New Horizons is truly a magical experience and almost whimsical.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
300ops,03-08-2020,"i would give the game a ten out of ten but the crafting system doesn't allow for you to craft multiples of items that seem like they should have a multi craft (fishing bait), manilla clams don't stack even though they aren't furniture or a donateable creature to the museum, and 1 island per switch console as a person who has always bought either multiple copies or memory cards to play multiple towns this breaks my heart as a die hard animal crossing fan, scorpion spawn rate was nerfed too heavily to the point that catching multiple is almost annoying because theyll fall into water or theyre will be a water bug that you cant see in any of the views for the camera. if the game fixes these issues i would deffinitly give it a 10 /10.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

leeaw,08-01-2021,"On one hand, I do truly adore this game. The ambiance is spectacular, the in-game holiday celebrations are something I genuinely look forward to, and the amount of connection I feel to my little town and villagers is a bit embarrassing, and seeing the community and creations within and surrounding this is fantastic. It's been genuinely helpful in establishing a routine while at home all day, and I owe it loads for that. On the other hand, I try to be objective on some level.
ACNH makes a number of significant improvements to player experience- but it stops so, so short. The one island per console restriction, the abysmal multiplayer that nearly (unintentionally) captures the absolutely dreadful, slow experience of going to a real airport, tool breakage that serves no gameplay purpose, excruciatingly slow animations for just about every action the player can preform, and so much more make this game so incredibly clunky. Nothing feels streamlined. Nothing feels good to interact with. The villagers have nowhere near enough dialogue to feel realistic, and at a point the gameplay loop gets extremely repetitive, and yet charm alone stops me from rating this any lower.
There's a lot to say about atmosphere in video games, and this is a prime example of the drastic effect it can have on games. If you're interested in a nice quaint experience, you should absolutely buy it. if you're looking for a good game, look elsewhere.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC

Sultan88,10-01-2021,"In my eyes, this game is near perfect. Granted, I don't have the gripes other people have with the game as I've spent most of the game playing on my own so far (girlfriend is getting a switch this week). The progression is not a big issue, it keeps me coming back to the game every day. There's not always a ton of stuff to do everyday, which is one of my issues, but there's enough going on to keep you coming back and coming back each day.

Villagers feel reasonably alive and you actually begin caring about them, giving and receiving gifts is a nice touch. I also started out with a sisterly villager (Rocket) who always seems to give me recipes and gifts when I'm having trouble. For a lot of people this is the game that got them into Animal Crossing (it certainly is for me), and I don't think that's a problem at all as the game lays out a lot of the groundwork for you and explains a lot of the ins and outs fairly quickly. There is definitely some figuring out to do and that's fine.

Maybe the one island thing will become a problem for me in future, but at the moment it's not and I'm rather enjoying logging in every day and seeing what's new and what's going on. If you have your own Switch to have by yourself, I think you'll have fun with this game and get a lot of enjoyment out of it. For me it's a 9, for some others it might be a 5 (or lower) and that's perfectly fine. The gripes I've seen from others are legitimate, especially players who are sharing a switch as I can imagine that would get annoying so I'm not going to gloss over those but I will say it obviously hasn't been something that has affected me.

Where I think the game falls short from a 10 generally is there is a lot of waiting. Waiting can kill your enjoyment for that day and I've found myself quitting the game and waiting for the next day (which is occasionally 5am as I'm on Blathers' time). But with that said, I have logged into the game everyday since I bought it, and it's honestly a blast. 9/10 is a fair score for a game like this, at least in my opinion.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Fisstza,10-01-2021,"A great game and in my opinion the best animal crossing game ever. The graphics are a huge upgrade from its prequel and it offers almost everything an Animal Crossing game should have. In addition to this it also has an interesting setting and you can always find something to do. But although it is great I have two issues with this game: The lack of multiple islands on a single system have disappointed a lot of people and even though I am not bothered by it too much, because I have my own switch, I can definitely understand the criticism and my second issue is that I simply don’t enjoy talking to the villagers that much anymore. In past games villagers had more personality and could actually be a bit mean to you, in new horizons however I feel like the villagers are just always pretty nice and generic with sometimes lines repeating after you spoke to them a few times. In the predecessors I felt more attached to my villagers while in the current title they feel kind of bland and uninteresting. But despite those negatives it still makes a great game which I have put hundreds of hours into and is definitely worth it’s money. An outstanding experience but with a few drawbacks that don’t quite make it perfect in my eyes.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Demonrex,20-03-2021,"It is a perfect life sim game with one substantial drawback - if you own only one switch console there is no way to create more than one island. It does not affect me, because even if there was an option to start separate island, I would not like to do so. However, there should be an option.
And only because of that I rate this game 9/10. Overall it is very solid game, that I recommend to anyone.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Muzak,18-01-2021,This is an amazing single player game. Unfortunately the truly lovely dev team didn't learn from other contemporary multiplayer games. You can't join your friends easily because there are 5 obnoxious hoops you have to jump through. Fix the multiplayer please! Have an app on the nook phone that just teleports you an online friend if they accept. There should not be such a tremendous roadblock even if they were trying to protect kids from online gaming or something.,7,ACNH,METACRITIC
BurtKocain,06-08-2021,"Few games, if any, have so serendipitously been released in exactly the right place at exactly the right time. For many, Animal Crossing: New Horizons provided the perfect conduit of escapism from the uncertainty and constant change in norms that came with the COVID-19 pandemic. And it doesn't hurt that, beyond the creature comforts and good vibes, there's a genuine case to be made for New Horizons as the best Animal Crossing ever. For the type of player who is extremely focused on curation, New Horizons offers the most customizable experience to date. And yet the more time you spend engaging with everything its world has to offer, the more likely it is for a profound sense of frustration and hollowness to set in. Many improvements to the series formula feel incremental rather than revolutionary, and there's a certain clunkiness to many design elements that you might expect a series to have ironed out by its fifth main installment. Worth noting is that despite numerous updates over the last year, the game still isn't nearly as rich in features or activities as its predecessor on the Nintendo 3DS. These are largely moot points, however, because the game delivers where it counts for many: As a fever-dream of cozy fantasy, and a brief antidote to increasingly uncertain times.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

junkykunky,09-02-2021,"This game would be a 10/10 if it wasn't for the fact the game is stretched along days and months just to get certain things done. I also don't appreciate how you have to pay for two separate switches, two separate games each costing 40$ and a Nintendo switch online membership. If you look past all of that the game can be really really fun especially with fishing, crafting and villagers. Not a perfect game though.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
MoewCP,28-11-2021,"It’s still an animal crossing game so I enjoy it. However, so much content was missing from the past games. Many characters being absent besides in the roost is sad and Tortimers role in harvs island was just to give him a role as it is unfortunately a pointless role. Adding cooking is cool but I still think the game would’ve been way better online with actual games and stuff to do like tortimers island. I personally don’t like the direction of more customization and would like it to be like you are just a villager. Missing features like tortimers island and it’s contents as well as small things like seeing the size of a fish or bug really hurts the games rating. The last main issue is villagers being to nice or soft. The GCN game was way to mean but now they feel to soft and lacking personality. Overall it needed more content.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Amajo,15-02-2021,"I was very hyped about this game in first month of playing. After several house and shop upgrades game became more boring. Repetitive announcements without good info like weather, who is at island, same route everyday and talking with villagers is not really entertaining-repetitive conversations. I'm stuck in lack of ideas for decorating, I wish that there were more items. Multiplayer is really irritating, when a player invites more than one player (freeze screen when one is leaving).

Loading screens when I see my face on switch screen make me think: What am I doing with my life?. Was that Nintendo goal?
If yes, then be happy, you made it.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
RianJohnson15,15-02-2021,"It's a well-made game though. I love how well detailed this game is, and everything you do before you get a 4-star island feels rewarding. However the amount of activities feel so limited compared to New Leaf and GCN. Everything feels repetitive from the announcements to the villager dialogue. Also, the multiplayer sucks and one island per console feels suspicious. It isn't like Wild World and its Spinoffs, but it isn't Top 3 best though.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
TempoTheMan,12-08-2021,"if you dont like to wait for things and do almost the same things every single day dont buy this, it has infinite playability but its just to boring for my taste, I like quiet games sometimes but this game doesn't even have a normal story, altho thats nintendo :/",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
ladiebird,20-03-2021,"I recently restarted my island after dropping off from the game around June last year and am enjoying it again so far, collecting all the bugs and fish and sea creatures and moving islanders in. It's a beautiful game, and I really enjoy the landscaping and creative freedom you have when creating your island. Unfortunately, after you finish building, there's nothing very worthwhile left to experience. I think this is why I stopped playing originally.

Compared to previous games, the events are much more focused around collecting items/DIYs than interacting with your villagers and the special visitors. As a result, every seasonal event feels sort of the same. The villagers themselves are also super boring to interact. At first, they give you tasks, but as you progress that seems to stop. Even then, the number of tasks you get isn't comparable to previous entries at all. It is very much unlike the previous games in that regard, where helping your villagers felt like a focal point. Villagers of the same personality also feel very similar. I think this is because they tend to talk about what you did yesterday, rather than asking questions or talking about themselves. I've heard this is because of the way dialogue is prioritised, not because it's limited.

The incremental updates have improved the game over time and kept things interesting, and since Nintendo says the game should have a 3 year lifespan, we can probably expect more. Long story short, if you like the idea of designing and collecting (bugs, fish, fossils, art, DIYs, items etc), buying New Horizons is well worth the time and enjoyment you'll get out of it. If you prefer the older games because of the dynamic interactions you get with villagers, or New Leaf for the interesting/varied seasonal events, maybe skip this one out.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
BlestTiger97489,02-02-2022,"This is a great game if you play on your own Switch, not so much if you share a Switch. The same screen multiplayer is not very great and people who join the island later miss out on the story and have some limitations like not being able to change ordinances. Personally, since I booted up the game first, I can experience everything, but I can understand why people would not like it because of this aspect. If you want to share a Switch, it is probably the best to avoid this title. If you mostly play alone or everyone has their own Switch or the people who want to share a console don't care on the story or the resident rep features and is willing to share the single player experience, consider picking this up.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC

Reefyza52,10-03-2021,"Gameplay:
Animal Crossing New Horizon is a life simulation game based On a world full of cute animals. Your goal in this game is to build a house, craft tools, and beautify your tropical island. You have to borrow the "" Bell "" which is the currency in this game from Tom Nook to pay the debt, players can get from doing a variety of in-game activities.
This game is based on real-time on doing the activity on the islands every activity takes time to finish. It has a free play style. You can start by building a house, decorate a garden, go fishing and do gardening or catching insects, and others. The game also has upcoming events to explore based on real-world events. Animals in your village can interact with you on your island which is the charm of this game.
The game also features seasonal events like the previous ones, such as winter or summer, with different fruits or fish and insects. You can also be able to select the region of your island which will affect the environment in the game. The uniqueness is that players can choose the location of their neighbor's home. Of course, players can be able to bond with their neighbors by interaction, and it will result in the acquisition of cool items and the events that will occur.
Animal Crossing New Horizons also has an online feature system where you and your friend's island. You can do activities together which makes the game even more fun. We have the ability to customize the island with the Terraforming feature which is a new system in the Animal Crossing franchise.

Graphics:
The arrival of Animal Crossing New Horizons on Switch comes with great graphics performance. Because a hybrid console specification makes it perform much better than the previous games. The graphics in the game still come in the same style that looks lovely. The character design is not different from the original, but it is cute and looks very good, and has always been unique to the Animal Crossing series. The game has a very nice color scheme in design that is pleasing to all ages. The camera angle in the game can be adjusted a little.

Soundtrack:
Nintendo has brought the talented team of musicians behind Animal Crossing: New Horizons' music back together for a beautiful acoustic performance with the stylish tropical life simulator's soundtrack that includes more than the 96 K.K. Slider songs that players can collect and listen to.

Overview:
Animal Crossing New Horizon is very free. This game can be very enjoyable when we have to stay at home to enjoy an island full of activities to do. This game can still play for years without the same boredom. Even though the game pace looks a bit slow, there is a lot of hidden stuff in the game to unlock waiting for you to explore.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
BLG,03-04-2021,"The Animal Crossing series has created a unique sense of relaxation and joy for close to twenty years. The newest entry, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, continues that tradition while elevating the gameplay to new levels. This elevation in gameplay is quite literally in-game now where a player can actually change the geography of their island. Island terraforming is debatably the biggest addition to this version of the game. In past iterations, customization was reserved for the players home and clothing, but it is now possible to modify everything from where your cliffs and rivers are located, to a coffee cup placed on an outdoor table. The debut of vast island customization options are accompanied by a robust crafting system. Players can now gather resources located across the island to craft custom furniture and tools. These new aspects feel like they were heavily influenced by survival games, like Minecraft, but they still retain the Animal Crossing charm that fans cherish.

One added survival game mainstay that has caused some outcry amongst Animal Crossing fans is tool degradation. In previous entries, tools like shovels, fishing rods, and nets could be used indefinitely without breaking, but in Animal Crossing: New Horizons players have to fight the constant battle of tools being destroyed through use. It appears that this decision was made to strengthen the need for the crafting system, however it seems to impede on the relaxing elements of the game, like fishing. One of the most frustrating aspects of this game is being in the midst of a peaceful fishing trek around the permitter of my island only for my rod to break with a half full inventory of fish. Then forcing me to return to my islands town center to craft a new one. In the past, this return to town was driven by a need to sell your goods from that fishing session. This rewarding journey into town to sell your commodities is now joined by a similar but shameful trip into town to craft another fishing rod. This new element has certainly detracted from the joyful and relaxing cornerstone of fishing in Animal Crossing games.

Though the crafting system is a cumbersome addition in regards to tools, its inclusion has certainly evolved the overall gameplay from a depth perspective. It has added more incentives to collect items and forage for resources across your island while rewarding you with interesting things to craft. Island customization is a welcome addition that can result in hours of rewarding gameplay. One of my favorite things to do is to add a small decorative piece to the island and wait to see if my wife notices when she is playing with her character. I don’t ever see my island being “complete” and I plan to constantly tweak aspects of it throughout the years.

Island customization adds to the replay-ability of the game, but something that pulls me back in even more are the seasonal updates and events that Nintendo releases for free. Two large updates were summer updates that debuted new gameplay elements to the Animal Crossing franchise like swimming in the ocean and diving to the depths of your coasts to retrieve sea creatures. Nintendo is even teasing their next big update which appears to be a Halloween themed addition. These updates provide a reason to hop back in and you will quickly find yourself sucked right back into the joyous gameplay.

One unfortunate side effect of island living in Animal Crossing: New Horizons is that it minimizes the enjoyment, previously supplied in previous entries, of adventuring to other islands. In previous entries, players could leave their continental town and take a boat ride to explore a tropical island where unique fish and items could be found. This enjoyment to escape your typical scenery has been replaced with the option to take a plane ride to randomly generated islands. Beyond plundering an island of its fruit and potentially discovering the elusive tarantula island, the incentive for players to get away isn't quite there anymore. An update that I would love to see Nintendo explore would be to diversify what you might find when taking a plane trip. Potentially discovering different biomes and fauna on these excursions would be a fantastic way to incentivize exploration and could recapture the magic of island visits from previous entries.

Overall this entry is a welcome addition to a beloved pedigree of games. Animal Crossing: New Horizons takes the chill and relaxing vibe of previous titles and modernizes it with more customization and structure. For Busch League, this game bordered a 9.5 out of 10, but features like item degradation and a less enjoyable island exploration process were steps back for the series. Busch League Gaming gives Animal Crossing: New Horizons a 9 out of 10.

ShyKitty,31-03-2021,"My emotions has been a roller coaster ride with this game so far since I never experienced playing New Leaf. I've clocked about 150 hours into this game so this is my review so far:
The best way I can describe this game is that at times it feels like the Sims 4 but with animals. At times it can come off as just a choir and décor game were all you do is just the same thing day in and day out: go fishing, look for shells, sell or buy something, gardening, talk to neighbors who really don't have much of anything important to say. It just comes off as very repetitive with extremely slow progress. The only reason I've clocked this many hours is because I started this game off with my fiancée at first, it was fun for a while until you notice that this game is not meant to be a two person player type of game. Who ever is first player, you will have to follow them around *everywhere* they go and if you don't then you will get poofed to the location that they are in. This makes multiplayer extremely frustrating when you want to do two different things on the opposite side of the island cause it's impossible to do. One of you will just have to sit there and wait and occupy yourself with something in the immediate area first player is in until they decide to move. This game doesn't allow two or at least 3 different saves you are only stuck with one island, in my opinion, this was a terrible decision for this game and shouldn't have been done. My fiancée had lost interest at playing at one point since things were to slow to his liking, I continued playing but noticed I was getting no where with my island, not much of anything was occurring until I released my fiancée was still player one. I ended up deleting the first save and started fresh.

Once I started over, I noticed huge amount of improvement. I noticed more bugs, got more land and started meeting more characters, so that is an upside. Now that I'm somewhere in the middle of updating my new island, I released that you or your villagers can't interact with their surrounding, for the most part all of my villagers do is just walk around, talk to each other now and then, possible water the plants and that's it. Not once have a seen a villager or visitor go inside the museum, buy anything from the nook shop, you pretty much have to gift them everything. Some gifts that you gave them won't even be in theirs homes so it will be as if you never gave it to them..it just depends on what the item is. It would be nice if décor objects were interactable with my character and villagers, It's pretty to look at but just feels like pointless objects that do nothing but lying around your island. I want more than just ""pretty to look at"" especially with a game like animal crossing.

Lacking the ability to evict certain villagers or decorate objects in this game is bothering when this entire game is about creating your own world. I dislike that there is no option to go into town hall and evict a villager you no longer want on your island, your forced to be mean or isolate them in hopes of them wanting to move but there's no telling when that will occur same with waiting for a visitors to arrive at the campsite. It's also disappointing that you can't recolor store items or balloon gifts cause they may already come with variations, the only thing you can recolor is DIYs you make which is restrictive for no reason. Tools constantly breaking after a couple hits is huge annoyance! Recrafting the same **** over and over again is not fun after the 100th time, especially when you're adding iron to the object- it should last longer than that!

The game also has a huge problem with regeneration! I can't tell you how many times I have collected a bunch of fossils only for Blathers to tell me that one (sometimes NONE) out of many fossils I had over to him are good cause they are already in the freaking museum! Why is the island regenerating the same damn fossils!? This problem is also occurring with bottle and balloon DIYs and Nook Mile ticket islands that end up wasting 2,000 miles on cause it's the SAME empty island I've already gone to before despite them saying you can't ever visit the island again? I have yet to find any new villagers at my campsite or any of these islands. It makes traveling frustrating and not worth it at times.

This issue of blocking certain islanders to maintain 10 only caused Leif to stop showing up entirely. For the first time ever, I had to time travel (changed my time zone to Honolulu) just to get him to finally show back up again since the last time I had seen him was a while ago. I'm still playing, I paid for this game so i want to see what happens next but there's room for tons and tons of improvement.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
Old_Duck,04-04-2021,"By far one of the best games on switch I would say. Being able to escape the real world and make a deserted island your new home is a fantastic experience, and now being able to craft furniture and pop it outside is a massive improvement for the animal crossing series.

This game is extremely addictive, as there is so much to do with your island. Eventually you will probably get sick of it, but you only feel like that after you've played it for ages.

A common gripe I have seen is tools breaking. Yes, it can be a little bit annoying at times, but it certainly shouldn't stop you from playing this fantastic game, and I didn't find that it disrupted my gameplay too much.

I highly recommend playing this game, as it will provide hours of fun for anyone.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

The crafting mechanic is cool, but, It's very annoying when your tool breaks, you have to rebuilt it all over again with the materials. It also lacks allot of the charm New Leaf had in my opinion. New Leaf had cool bonus items like a Wii U and even Nintendo game themed items! Animal Crossing: New Horizons lacks allot of that. But, don't get me wrong, It's a blast making your island look cool with furniture, visiting other's island and even playing with friends once in awhile is great!

- Tiene una introducción maravillosa.
- Es tremendamente inmersivo y sus personajes te hacen tener ""sentimientos"" rápidamente.
- Sus mecánicas nuevas respecto a entregas anteriores hacen que sea tan diferente pero a la vez sin perder la esencia de lo que es.
- Soundtrack exquisito.
- Es adictivo jugablemente.

CONTRAS:
- Llega un momento en donde no hayas más qué hacer, lo cuál es crítico para este tipo de videojuegos.
- No hay una vasta variedad de diálogos de los vecinos; hay solo 10 tipos de diálogos según su personalidad, pero muchísimos más de ellos, lo cual causa que solo cambien en apariencia.
- Pantallas de carga y tutoriales excesivamente molestos al momento de jugar en línea.
- Falta de minijuegos.
- Para lo que significa el género, puede que por momentos lo relajante se vuelva aburrido.

El más reciente título de la saga Animal Crossing cubre muchas carencias que tenían anteriormente, pero al mismo tiempo le quita personalidad y se vuelve muy monótono a las horas antes de ""acabar"" el juego. También añade contenido invasivo que fácilmente podría no estar, pero eso no quita que sea un juego de calidad, bien hecho y con contenido suficiente, hasta cierto punto.

ec1123,28-04-2022,"This game was definitely hype for switch owners when it first came out during the pandemic, but I haven't really played it too much since.

The graphics are relaxing to look at with so much detail in both the items and the music change-ups. But there's a lot of times I see too much text and not enough of handing me the control. Stardew Valley might be better optimized in this regard. Still, I poured a ton of hours into this game during covid when it first came out. The time just kinda flew by which was sometimes a real problem, but I think the game can be enjoyed at a slow pace.

lowey,12-10-2021,"There are few games that I have sunk more hours into than Animal Crossing: New Horizons. It sucks you in and compells you to return day after day. It's a solid game, as you would expect, from Nintendo. There is a wealth of things to do each day, although earlier in the game it limits you a little — probably to stop it sucking away your entire life — and once you've completed the main story arc there is still plenty to do. As the game progresses the story falls away and it becomes more and more like a sandbox game.

It's not perfect, of course: dialogues are lengthy and often add nothing, and the control mechanism for tools can be infuriating at times (""no don't dig that up,"" ""put that fence back,"" ""I didn't want to talk to them!"") And as many haters have already stated endlessly, you'll really have to have one console per player in the house since all players on a console share the same island. But in spite of its flaws it's a game that makes me feel good. I will open the game in the morning to check one or two things and then, before I know it, I realise I'm an hour late for work. The online community really makes this game too. Visiting others' islands via online multiplayer is great fun and can help new players get ahead quickly, and it's amazing just how much content (characters, items, recipes, fossils, artworks, bugs, fish, characters' dialogue, etc) they've squeezed in. Well worth the cost when I look at how many hours of ejnoyment I've received from this little gem of a game.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC

Neko_-Tiger,17-11-2021,If you a Long time fan then this is by far a no brainer. New to the series will find themselves playing for hours and Days unless you time travel but i say just play game as intended and you will have a game that will go on for years to come. AVOID Time Travel it will shorten your enjoyment.,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Minus_Infinity,04-11-2022,"I think this game is good, it just takes too long for anything important to happen. Waiting days and days for stuff that should take 5 minutes.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
KamaiJR,22-11-2021,"Game make me have a time to live in Island,relax game Build home have friend",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
ochjago,22-11-2021,"Good, totally enjoyable game. But for how long? I don't play that kind of games very often, so don't exactly know what could have been done better, but the game is kind of boring after a while. Sure, first weeks are exciting and all, but then there's no reason to play, maybe except for some seasonal events.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
nodavan,07-12-2021,"I would say it's a go-to game for NS. The game play is simple. If you like collecting things and crafting DIY stuffs, this game is really made for you. There are also holiday and seasonal items too!",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
GearDestruction,11-12-2021,"my main issue with this game is compared to the older version, the characters are too nice, they are extremely nice. and that makes feel the game less enjoyable compared to the older version when you're looking to have a social interaction with the villagers of your island. the game lacks of realism and the feeling of making friends because you don't see a harsh version of your villagers when their personalities are cranky and snooty who were made to be rude or harsh in the early friendship.

I think they need to make the villagers more natural in the next game, because at the end of the day, the villager is what makes this game so enjoyable and without that sense of realism, it makes the game feels a bit less fun.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
ShamaloOoOoW,22-12-2021,"A real discovery for me who had never played the license, at the beginning I told myself that it was only for children because of the small animals in the game. But in reality I see in this game a very good potential for future sequel, a construction game not quite complete but which is very reminiscent of or at least gently brings sims closer, especially in version 2.0. I am personally convinced…",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Watson0l0,23-12-2021,"An incredible time killer. The graphics do not cause rejection, but some of the gameplay moments are rejected, in particular the problems with the creation of objects, what was the problem so that you could create objects several at a time or use the main storage location as a buffer?",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
blisslovesotome,04-01-2022,"Would have been better if we had more things we had in the previous installments, but overall it's a good game.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
UrbanEelf,18-01-2022,The only reason I'm not giving a 10 is because this game is not durable as they promised.,9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Gugugagapaga,15-08-2022,"Very fun game, I’ve spent over 300 hours playing it but even so a lot of things could be and SHOULD be improved",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
Lil_Caucasian,29-01-2022,"This is a solid Animal Crossing game, but it lacks a lot of content the others had. By the time the updates came out I had fallen off of it, wish the content was there at launch.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Ka1dowskiX,07-02-2022,"The game, as a representative of the Animal Crossing series, offers interesting gameplay and is highly addictive. New Horizons offers wonderful graphic style, countless possibilities of modifying the island and highly controversial multiplayer aspect. Pointless limitations in this mode are a drawback of this game, but apart from that it is a wonderful experience recommended both for children and adults.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
shw079,04-02-2022,"The game is alright, but get tedious very soon. It is not the type of game for me.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
albegres,05-02-2022,"84/100
Good innovations, QOL improvements and good graphics. Somehow it lacks the charm of the previous titles",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
zalivka,20-02-2022,"Playing slowly every day, my ultimate goal is to get either Ankha or Marshall as a villager. Better both at the same time. I catch butterflies, communicate with the inhabitants, a very good game as an addition to something else.",8,ACNH,METACRITIC
mariohitsBlock,28-02-2022,"The best Animal Crossing game I have played. I've played other Animal Crossing games before, but this one tops out as the best. You get to relax on an island while doing other tasks for Tom Nook and Isabelle. The new DLC they released recently is very cool and the fact that you can carry the new features you did there to your island is awesome. A very good game to buy if you're an Animal Crossing fan.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
JayconUnlimited,05-03-2022,"I absolutely love Animal Crossing New Horizons. The graphics are gorgeous and I have fond memories of creating my custom island through quarantine. However, I can't say this game is better than New Leaf. Once I got burned out, I really got burned out. I never had that problem with New Leaf. If I went back to New Leaf, I would love it. If I came back to New Horizons, I'd be terrified to open the tab. The reason why New Horizons felt dry after a while was because the game didn't do anything new when I unlocked K K Slider. After that you get terraforming which is really nice. I used terraforming for a couple days, I got content with my island's layout and that was it. However, don't take this review as me disliking the game because I clearly don't. It's so beautiful and relaxing and I'd recommend it highly for fans.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC

My favorite game!
It´s many much hours! game is perfect!",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
BannerSiamang15,10-03-2022,This game is boring. All you do is fish and talk to annoying villagers while collecting every single thing because I can't just sell something I might want to use it later. That being said this is the best game ever.,9,ACNH,METACRITIC

Although it has many flaws, it helps a lot of people through tough times.
I like animal crossing.",9,ACNH,METACRITIC
Striker7745,06-07-2022,"This game looks a bit cute for adults to play like most Nintendo games, however the gameplay is totally awesome and extremely addictive! Nintendo has put a LOT of work into Animal Crossing: New Horizons and the amount of thought and detail put into the game is truly amazing, it's very highly polished and, totally bug free (coding wise lol), and looks incredible on the Switch OLED screen. This is a MUST BUY if you own a Switch, it's a masterpiece! The only negatives I can say about the game is 1) you can it get involved in online play unless you know someone else with the game 2) it would be good if the graphics became transparent if your character is hidden behind a cliff, house or tree.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
seno721,06-05-2022,This is a amazing game with plenty of fun to be had! But the issue comes if you started with the game where it becomes less appealing and more of a chore to play and hard to come back too and almost overwhelming with there now being lots of weeds and new features! Overall its a fun game i just wish the game came out with all the content at the start rather than adding them later,7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Novaxlo,22-08-2022,"Este es un Animal Crossing a la altura de los demás juegos de la franquicia, con diferentes experiencias de juego. Un juego muy carismático, aunque a veces se siente como un trabajo jugarlo en vez de relajarte. Pero si nunca has jugado a esta saga, te recomiendo probarlo ¡¡Es un buen título!!

stupidopinion,22-06-2022,"I haven't really played this game in quite some time. It really got me through parts of 2020, being a very relaxing town-building/decorating game. Visiting other people's islands is a nice feature and I have a lot of great memories because of it, but it would be foolish to say the online is good. The game itself struggles occasionally with performance, especially from heavily decorated islands/online islands, and it takes forever to visit other islands. The lack of updates has been disappointing for someone who really liked filling out the museum with fish, art, insects, and fossils. Design features for the museum and additional artifacts to collect would definitely bring me back, but it seems they have no interest. If you enjoy a slow-paced relaxing experience with plenty of design options this game is definitely for you though.

Negative points for the single island ""feature"" though. It's still a baffling decision, like why not allow accounts the option to choose between joining an old island and making a new one?",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
waywardlaser,28-06-2022,"It's frustrating how this is simultaneously the best entry in the series while still lacking a ton of features that made the others so great. I can say I've sunk over 400 hours into New Horizons alone, which is far more than what can be said for any in the series since the original. New Leaf is cool, but can you play it on a TV? Nope.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Nintendist,02-07-2022,this game is so beautiful and good. i love every detail here. this game runs lovely,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
sarahaj,02-07-2022,"While a wonderful experience, I feel this game is incomplete without some of the quality of life changes that were made in the previous game. While you will no doubt find yourself pulled into this experience for 100 hours or so, at the end, you may feel it shallow. Couple that with repetitive dialogue that was done better on the DS release Wild World I cannot help but find myself slightly disappointed.",7,ACNH,METACRITIC
Dragoduval,23-01-2023,"Its not a bad game, but it does get boring after a few days / weeks. Not worth the full price.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC
PacoBN23,24-09-2022,"El hecho de poder terraformar tu isla y hacer literalmente lo que tú quieras te da mucha libertad y, sobre todo, alarga el juego hasta horas infinitas. Por otro lado, el hecho de que tenga fácilmente más de 20000 objetos para decorar hace que el nivel de personalización que ofrece sea enorme.
No obstante, el hecho de que sólo pueda haber una isla por consola y que el juego sólo se destine al jugador principal limita mucho a los demás.",6,ACNH,METACRITIC
MISHM3SH,28-09-2022,I love the game it is extremely relaxing and fun! Can be quite hard to find items but trading sites like nookazon make it easy! It can be a wee hit grindy tho! But thats fine cuz in quartine it helped pass the time!,10,ACNH,METACRITIC
Divad27,18-12-2022,"It's nice and fun the first few hours, when you spend more than 10/15 hours depending on the rhythm it becomes repetitive and boring (in my case obviously). There comes a point where the only thing you can do every day is go in, take the fruits and go out, on the fifth day you stop going in. This is not a problem as such because many people do like this idea, the problem comes from Nintendo itself, which has not been able to exploit the game that has been so successful, they have barely updated it in 2 years, leaving it dead since the a few months after his departure. Beyond that, collecting fish or bugs is fun if you like to collect, you can also spend time decorating your island or your house, yes, it is an activity for a very specific audience. It's not a bad game, but a bad job from the company.",5,ACNH,METACRITIC

RIbbotreview,17-02-2023,"I did not think that the newest animal crossing game would be so fun, relaxing AND groundbreaking! This game is one of the games that made 2020 (the covid-19 pandemic) fun. This should be 100% a must buy for the Nintendo switch.",10,ACNH,METACRITIC
