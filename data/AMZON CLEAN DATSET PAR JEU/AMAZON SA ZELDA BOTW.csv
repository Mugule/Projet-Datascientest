"Wow, who would have thought that after thirty incredible years of Zelda, with some of the best and most critically acclaimed games ever, Nintendo would manage to create what is, hands down, the best Zelda game to date in the form of ‚ÄúThe Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.‚Äù  A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time, Majora‚Äôs Mask, it is time to step aside.  The Zelda series has a new champion.  Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and feels destined to be a classic.The Legend of Zelda series is, I must admit, my favorite video game series of all time (which is my favorite past-time) I have been absolutely obsessed with Zelda since I first played Ocarina of Time at the age of ten, sometimes obsessed to a rather unhealthy degree.  I have loved every Zelda game, and especially every 3D Zelda, though none of them quite captured the same feeling of wonder and exploration.  Until very recently, I would rank Ocarina of Time as my favorite video game of all time, but it looks as though that mantle is finally being passed to another game.  Breath of the Wild feels like the Zelda game Nintendo has always wanted to make, but hasn‚Äôt been able to do to technological constraints or what have you.  This game feels like the essence of what Zelda is, and always has been, about.  While this is a lengthy review, this is a game that warrants such a lengthy review.Story:  The story to this game begins in a place called the chamber of resurrection.  Our hero, Link, has been asleep in a form of stasis for 100 years.  When he awakes, he finds the land of Hyrule in ruins, starting with the desolate Temple of Time on the Great Plateau, the starting location.  Link is told by a voice in his head that he must be the light to shine upon the land of Hyrule.  After meeting a mysterious old man (throwback to the original Zelda game there) Link sets out on his quest to save Hyrule from the evil monster inside Hyrule Castle, known as the Calamity Ganon.  Without spoiling too much of this story, I will only say that it is probably the most cinematic Zelda story to date.  The fact that this game has voice acting, which is a first for the Zelda series, adds a lot of weight to the key story moments.  The characters feel far more fleshed out, and they feel genuinely human.  This game‚Äôs version of the titular princess Zelda might be the most relatable and interesting incarnation of the character to date, as she has genuine depth to her character.  The other pivotal characters also feel uniquely more fleshed out as well, providing some of the most memorable story cut-scenes in a Zelda game, or any Nintendo game.  Though Wind Waker and Skyward Sword might rival it, this is probably the best Zelda story to date.  It does a great job of immersing you into the Gameplay and the world itself.  Moreover, as you explore the world, you feel as though a story is being told through the exploration itself.  One of the ingenious methods to the story-telling in this game is how it is told in a nonlinear nature, meaning that you can track down different pieces of the story in any order, and still have it all make sense in the end.  Parts of the story are also optional, so it doesn‚Äôt ever feel like it‚Äôs spoon-fed to you, which is a good thing.Presentation:  Right off the bat, I must say that Breath of the Wild is one of the most Gorgeous looking games that has ever been made to me.  The simple, soft and vibrant colors also contain a hidden elegance and sophistication that can convey lots of emotion both in terms of story and Gameplay.  The style feels reminiscent of Skyward Sword‚Äôs, which I also adored, but taken to the next level.  This is the first Zelda title to be made in HD, and it shows.  The character designs are flawless, and unforgettable.  The stunning lighting effect, particularly when the sun rises and sets, remain beautiful to watch from start to finish, and the whole game just looks fantastic.  This is magnified on the Nintendo Switch, with longer draw distances and a better performance overall than the Wii U version.  There were still some frame-rate drops during moments in the game, particularly during battle moments against the Moblin enemies.  While the frame-rate hiccups are still noticeable on the Switch, the game runs noticeably better overall.  This minor complaint never ruined the game, or the immersion for me.I for one love the choice of music in this game.  The subtle but brilliant use of piano cords make the world feel more natural and organic, and is contrasted brilliantly with the high-energy guardian themes and shrine theme.  This, in a way, helps the thematic element of nature versus technology play out in its sound design.  While the music may not be something you would listen to outside of the game in the same way you would with previous Zelda games, I believe the music and sound design is perfect for this game.  That said, the horse riding theme, Hateno village, and Hyrule Castle are amazing pieces. The Hateno Village theme is simple and beautiful.  The voice acting is also very solid, and I would love to see future Zelda games expand on it even more.What it comes down to is that the visual style choices, and the music help to make this, arguably, the most immersive and atmospheric open-world game I have ever played, and it serves the gameplay perfectly.Gameplay:  This is the best and most top-notch Gameplay I have ever experienced, period.  The controls are so darn good that you could bounce a dime of them and get change leftover.  As a veteran Zelda player, there was a learning curve to the controls at first, but after getting accustomed to them, they really did feel like second nature.  This is the first 3D Zelda to have a jump button, a simple addition that changes the Gameplay mechanics significantly.  Furthermore, the ability to climb in this game also adds a whole new dimension to the Gameplay.This time around, the enemy AI is quite advanced for a Zelda title.  The enemies also do quite a bit more damage to Link than they ever have before in a 3D title.  What this means is that every encounter, and combat situation feels dangerous, and as though something is at stake.  Link‚Äôs arsenal of weapons this time around includes far more than just a single sword, but many swords, as well as sticks, axes, spears, clubs, magic rods, and more.  You also have a plethora of shields to use, and bows to use.  The weapons in this game do break after being used a bit, which might be a point of contention to some.  I love this mechanic, and feel that it forces you as the player to think and be strategic as to how you approach every encounter with an enemy.  Link can also use stealth to sneak up on his enemies, destroy exploding barrels nearby and watch the enemies scream in horror (such as satisfying feeling,) or even use his rune abilities to take the enemies out before they know what hit them (more on that later.)  The possibilities in this game feel almost endless.  The coolest move Link can pull off in this game is the flurry rush; when fighting an enemy close-up, if you dodge just in time, Link will do a dodge or backflip in slow-motion, and proceed by striking the enemy several times, ending them in the process.  It‚Äôs the coolest thing ever.In this game, Link uses a plethora of abilities known as the Rune abilities.  With these abilities, Link can create remote bombs that he can explode upon impact whenever desired.  You can also use Cryonis, which creates ice blocks from water, which can be used as platforms to climb.  You can use what is called stasis, which temporarily freezes objects in place, allowing you to hit them several times, after which point they go flying every which way.  Then there is Magnesis, which is my favorite.  This allows Link to push, pull, and lift heavy metal objects from afar, and use them to make paths, or even drop them on enemies from a distance.  You‚Äôll often stumble upon scenarios, particularly in the dungeons and shrines, that allow you to find your own clever ways of solving puzzles with these brilliant and fun mechanics.  Like every aspect of the game, the experimentation alone will soak up hours of your life.Speaking of shrines and dungeons, the dungeons in this game are vastly different than in previous Zelda games.  Whereas previous Zelda‚Äôs had you collect keys, a key item, in order to make it to the final boss fight, this game‚Äôs dungeons are more based around experimentation and manipulation.  Through using Link‚Äôs powers and abilities, as well as the map in this game, it allows Link to manipulate the layout of the dungeon, and essentially bend them to his will.  This is another aspect of this Zelda that feels so fresh and fun.  The bosses at the end of the dungeon are also really fun to fight.  While the game only has four main dungeons, there are more than 100 mini shrines throughout.  The shrines are essentially bite-sized dungeons, and play-out as such on a micro level.  Many of them require you to use your rune abilities to solve them and progress, while others have you engage in a little boss fight of sorts with a guardian robot.  Needless to say, these shrines are fantastic and provide some of the most enjoyable and mind-bending scenarios I‚Äôve ever encountered, and manage to surprise at every turn.  Moreover, the whole over-world almost feels like one giant, outdoor dungeon.  What I mean by that is that while it isn‚Äôt literally a huge dungeon, you begin solving puzzles and thinking about where, and how you want to proceed to the next shrine or dungeon right of the bat.  Simply getting to these shrines and dungeons feels like a puzzle in and of itself.Being a truly open-world game, this game‚Äôs real obstacle, beyond even the enemies and the dungeons, is the world itself.  This game is an open world adventure game, but it‚Äôs also a survival one.  This world feels alive.  The weather changes, the wild-life has a mind of its own, and the world will try to kill you in a multitude of ways.  Whether it be by falling from foolishly attempting to climb massive heights, to lightning striking your metal items, to the wild animals such as bears and wolves that see you as their next meal.  Furthermore, the realistic and ingenious physics engine makes the game world feel more natural.The trick then, is to use the world to your advantage.  By hunting wild animals and gathering supplies and ingredients, Link can cook a multitude of dishes and elixirs to refill both his heart meter (no hearts in pots or grass in this game) or his stamina gauge.  You can hunt just about any wild animal you see in the wild.  Cooked meat is always more effective than raw meat in straightening you, and you can combine it with other ingredients like fruits, vegetables, or grains and wheat to increase their effect.  You can make potions by combining critters such as lizards, frogs, or bugs with monster parts that provide different temporary stat boosts.  Just look out for the dubious food!  You can also break chunks of rocks to find minerals, ore, and other materials.  By buying and selling these goods, you create your own in game economy of sorts.The other aspect of this game that makes it truly feel like the ‚Äúopen air‚Äù experience that Eji Aonuma called it is none other than the glorious climbing mechanic.  You can climb almost anything in this game, whether it be a rock face, a cliff, buildings, towers, Hyrule Castle itself, the Temple of Time, you name it.  You can even climb trees, and certain rock monsters that appear throughout the world.  Climbing is yet another big component and aspect to this game that Nintendo really got down pat, and it does feel like a game changer.  I‚Äôve played several games where you can climb certain things, like Assassin‚Äôs Creed or Uncharted, but never has it been this freeing in how you can do it.  This simple yet elegant mechanic really makes the already huge world feel even bigger.  Climbing will slowly eat up your stamina gauge, so it‚Äôs up to you to figure out how you want to approach it, and finding little footholds is always a good way to rest when you need to.  The only places you can‚Äôt climb every wall is in the dungeons and the shrines.  The other open-air aspect to this world is the paraglider.  When you reach the top of the mountain or a tower, you don‚Äôt need to worry about climbing all the way back down.  Now, Link can simply jump off the cliff, and glide down to the world below ala Batman.  This mechanic remains euphoric from start to finish.  It is also an ingenious way to fix what could have been a potential problem before it happened, by allowing you to breezily get down a mountain pf tower right off the bat without having to climb all the way back down.In this game, you can catch any number of wild horses, tame them, and check them into a stable.  In past Zelda‚Äôs, your horse was Epona, and it was the only horse you could get.  Here, there are several horses, some are harder to get than others, and they all have different stats.  When you do catch your horse, it really does feel like your own horse, since you caught it, tamed it, and gave it a name.  You can hold up to five horses at any given time, and ride around the world, into the villages, and even approach combat while on horseback with your melee weapons and bows.  As someone who finds joy and excitement by simply exploring the game world, and doing random things, riding around Hyrule has never felt more fun.  I used to love doing that all the way back in Twilight Princess, and this aspect puts that game to shame.  The Horses can die, which may seem annoying to some, but I love it as, once again, it offers more strategy and thinking than previous games.  When fighting a Guardian, it‚Äôs better going up against it on horseback as you have the element of speed on your side.Unlike previous Zelda games, where boss battles were restricted to the dungeons themselves, here in Breath of the Wild, you will often encounter boss like enemies in the world.  These come in the form of giant rock monsters (Stone Talus,) Centaur-like creatures (Lynels, another throwback to Zelda on NES,) and the now iconic game enemy known as the Guardian‚Äôs (octopus-like robots that attempt to kill you throughout the game.)  You can approach these enemies however you choose, or not approach them at all and leave them be at first.  Throughout the game, as you become more powerful, you may be bold enough to take them on, it is all up to you.  The first time I killed a Guardian was a defining moment for me, as was my first Lynel kill.  What‚Äôs amazing is that even after you have several of the key upgrades, the enemies still feel like a threat.What makes the Gameplay in Breath of the Wild so good, and so perfect, is that you as the player can literally approach it however you want.  The whole world is your oyster, and it‚Äôs up to you to figure out how you want to use it.Replay value.  This game has lots of reason to play even after your first initial playthrough, which will likely take at least forty hours if you just do the main story.  I have played this game from start to finish a few times already (and probably will several more times.)  As it stands, you can find all of the optional things in the game (the Master Sword itself is optional,) Find and beat all of the shrines, collect all of the Korok seeds (plant like creature fans may know from Wind Waker,) and do any number of side-quests.  The side-quests I have done have all been tremendously fun, and while the rewards may be simple, just playing them feels like a reward.  You can help herd cucoos for a chicken-freak in Kakariko village, catch a royal white-steed, help a man start a village from the ground-up, and even build your own house in Hateno Village.  This game has tons of replay value, apart from just the urge to go back and play it again.  Because of the open-ended nonlinear nature of this game, you can replay the game from start to finish, and take a completely different path, even so far as taking on the last boss right away (though not a good idea if you value your life.)  Just experimenting with all the different weapons, finding all the different locations and using your rune abilities will keep you distracted for quite some time.**Nintendo Switch differences:Having played this game on the Switch as well as the Wii U, I can safely say that either version will deliver an incredible experience.  That said, the Switch version is probably ever so slightly the superior version.  Apart from running a little bit better, I found the switch controller very comfortable, particularly with how easy it is the detach the joy-cons from the controller slots to the tablet-screen.  Speaking of which, playing this game on the go is a lot of fun.  I would recommend saving the key story moments for the TV, but playing the game casually undocked with the Switch screen has felt great. **Verdict:The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a Masterpiece, and a game I feel will be looked at as a timeless classic.  While it isn‚Äôt literally ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù it has its occasional frame-rate issues, and the very occasional camera issue, it is, to me, as close to flawless as video game‚Äôs get.  I haven‚Äôt been this immersed, this addicted, or simply had this much fun with a single player game in years, if not decades.  This is the best game Nintendo has made in likely the past twenty years, if not ever.  I have no regrets in saying I am ready to move on from Ocarina of Time being my all-time favorite video game, as Breath of the Wild now takes the cake.  This is the game that really feels tailored to be played however you choose.  It feels like the fully realized Zelda game that Nintendo has always wanted to make, and the one we as fans have been salivating for.  A new Zelda of any kind is always a big deal, but this one feels uniquely special.  I hyped this game to Death Mountain and back, and not only does it meet expectations, it defies them.  This feels like a giant playground full of joy, wonder, discovery exploration, and fun.  This is a game of survival, action, adventure, comedy, sadness, joy, and excitement, all wrapped into one package.  To say it bluntly, this has everything that makes Gaming such a great past-time to me, and millions of people, and it manages to capture the essence of Zelda most of all.  This is an absolute must-buy, and a must play.  I would honestly encourage you to get a Wii U, or a Nintendo Switch if you do not already have one, to experience this Masterpiece.  So get it, play it, enjoy it, and take a Breath of the magnificent Wild.Cons:Occasional frame-rate issuesPros:Sublime ControlsPerfect, Flawless, and incredible GameplayMasterful Open-World ExplorationFreedom and personal choiceMechanics encourage experimentationFresh new dungeon designAmazing art directionBrilliant music and sound designGreat Voice ActingGreat Story and awesome charactersLots of secrets to findLots of replay valueOverall: 10/10Peace, Dana",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is just a fight game I recieved a Used game that was missing it's pamphlet the used order was cancelled that this changed to new condition without approval we would have possibly just cancelled. It is nothing like Zelda Ocarina that was a group of small mini games all sewn together in a fairly great fable. At first I was very hesitant to buy this game because a serious gamer said he beat it in 30 hours and we had a few years of fun playing Zelda Ocarina of Time all it's side games and mini games while using it to teach the children to read instructions. They became great fans of Zelda and when they got older asked for a Wii they specifically asked for the game and bow set up for I guess the name was Link for their birthdays as they both are born in March.  I have not played this Link line of games since Nintendo 64 and as I play through it not using walk throughs as I was told it is a short game I am learning this young man must have skipped all the side actitivies, competitions and looking for all the game gifts just fought his way through the game.I think if the information that comes with the new game helps play the game it would have been worth purchasing a new game or at least a book to help me find things. I do not know if there is a map to discover in the game like in Ocarina but I am very lost and tracking backwards without a good map in this game. I hope it turns up somewhere or I can buy it as I just bought salt for the recipes. The recipes are fun it would be nice if I could keep a list of what was done so I can make the better ones again as I discover them in game play. I find the mountains very difficult to climb without the speed and stamina elixers.It is growing on my slowly.This is not a child's game like Zelda Ocarina of time with brighter colors that would probably be excellent updated for the Switch for younger children...but  it is an adventure game. At first because it is a big jump from the 64 game I did not like it but as time went on it began to grow on me I am beginning to like it but I sure would like a map I am so lost even driving without a physical recent map.Do you want a nice review or do you want the truthThe graphics apparently are very good on Zelda Breath of time for the Switch.But like with Skylanders Imaginators which runs on Toys to Life which I began playing because my nephew plays it on my Switch gifted to me for Christmas.I found the new Switch Zelda game to be very difficult loaded constantly with Boss monsters and difficult puzzles.These is only normal run and Pro run games so it is apparently designed for the hard core gamer unlike the Zelda Ocarina of time I bought used for near new price many years after it as designed for the Nintendo 64 because it was more a younger persons puzzle and adventure game loaded with mini games and not as much violence.This is a Hard core games game apparently someone who just finds a way to fight to the end then resells or soon after purchasing it like I bought it used missing all the pamphlets and information and then it was tried to be foisted off on me as a new game.If it had been new I would have returned it because I am a beginnger level player always will be even though I have playe 20 years.I use walk throughs and information to help me play most games.But as this is a constant fight fight fight M for Mature Violent game now if you are a hard core gamer you can rent the game fight through ignore all the side quests, not enjoy the horses which are very untameable and do not follow good directions so much I often found myself walking and whistling for the away horse.If you like near impossible puzzles and fighting very few clues in a game that does not like to let you go back where you have been and just want to fight through a game this is the game for you.But rent it and play it on the Switch handheld counsel as it looks very washed out on the tv.Designed for the Switch and for the Hardcore gamersNot a child's game.But if you are a hard core gamer I suggest you get the Ammibos to up the gameplay a bit which they do not tell you can be used in the game and run it on professional level before you try to resell it.Also the harder part of the game than the monsters are some of the many Shrine puzzles one which runs like a marble roll game there is a trick I am working out on how to solve it.If it was for a child or a novice player and less about fighting and adventure I am sure it would be kept by the right people driving up the pice like Animal Crossing has.If you want a review that you do not pay fordon't punish the honest person for saying I don't like itBut the hard core gamers love it.So I knew when someone told me they beat it in 30 hours it as probably just a bang bang fight fight hit hit hard core gamers game.I rate it M for Mature and Lots of Game violence as the bully monsters constnatly beat up travelers whom you can save to come back and find them stuck eternally in the same scenario with the same monsters for the same small monster organ rewards for killing them and saving the victims.I found most the recipets to be near worthless against Boss Monsters which this game is loaded with.I give it a big thumbs up for young hard core fight gamers but for novice and children along with parents I suggest you find a game that is less violent as apparently children are shooting us after playing this lot of very violent games out now.If you are a hardcore gamer like the Game store employees are rent the game don't open the package and try to sell it off to me as new after you have used it or here. And remember some of us who are not serious gamers need the pamphlets and all the help we can get because our minds are different than yours we like to stop eat the apple, cook the meals, see the worlds all over Built by Nintendo and buy the Amiibos.I did not want to buy the game at the game store as I knew as hard as the employee tried to sell it to me ""new"" at a reduced price he had played it while off work and then brought it back repackaged it. Don't sell me a game think I don't know it is not new and do not change the name to new condition and then charge me illegally to my credit card for a used game especially when I know it is missing every single pamphlet that it comes with that gives information like you can use an Amiibo in the game.This game after all these years seems to still be a single player game which having the option for 2 to 4 player adventuring and fighting the huge monsters online or at home would surely be more entertaining.If I had paid full price I would be disappointed and stuck with a Used game. Rent these games first before buying if you can find a place to rent them. But so far I have put the Switch down sometimes for months like the Xbox One which has not been used in over a year as the PS3 controllers can be run wired not run out of battery power, run on the tv and the cherished but not mass produced PS vita system which still runs high used because of limited production and high popularity for the number produced.As I understand it is a loved Gamer hard core game I gave it a 5 starbut for me I give it as sit in the corner now for awhile if the horses are not able to be tamed and are programmed to run away from any sigh of trouble or into a big fight to kill you no in between the horses are crazy. So just walk through.If all you want to do is run to the end not enjoy the fabulous perk hard to tame and catch seriously wild horses that develop personality issues such after encountering Ogres and other monsters rent the game don't try to resell it to me as new as I buy new games also but as these sold out it has been difficult locally to find it not being resold as a new game when it is used also.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"**No spoiler review**At this point, I could never have imagined the game industry without this game.  Every once in a while, a game comes out that just says what everyone is thinking subconsciously but cannot quite make out the words, an itch that needs to be scratched, that puts all the pieces together in entertainment culture and builds the foundation for the next age for the game industry.  This is that game.Gameplay: The limits have been lifted.  There are almost no restrictions to the possibilities of engagement with the environmental situations.  Remember how amazing the Metroid screw jump felt in Metroid Prime 2, flying for the first time in Mario 64, jumping through the web in the Deku tree in Ocarina of Time, etc.  In those moments, you knew you had experienced something that would change you, that you were playing a game that reached far beyond what you thought was possible.  Now imagine a game that applies that feeling to every element of the game.  While diverging some from past Zelda mechanics, they are changes that encourage you to grow as a player and engage in your environment and as such could not have been any other way.  Don't worry, it is very nicely balanced.Music: Even the music approach has been redefined for this game.  Eerie, peaceful, and epic.  I do not think a single note in this game is synthesized and the sensation feels like the game is calling to you or empathizing with you.  The music element is used in a way that is unlike anything you probably have experienced before, hearkening back to the complex music development in intellectual music of the 20th century.  The best visual reference I can give is that the music feels like water hitting your skin, that is how tangible it is.Graphics: When a design is this polished and revolutionary, graphics, while normally being the easiest to pinpoint, easily take more of a backseat, however this game has some of the most psychologically stimulating environments of any game in recent years.  Graphics for this game cannot be discussed separate from gameplay as everything flows together in a near perfect fashion.  The physics used in conjunctions with the models and layout of the map are immediately accessible and complex.  Here are some examples of scope: The scope of the land is so vast and varied that every minute exploring provides an almost entirely different experience than the one just prior. A friend of mine is playing the game and while we have both been exploring the same areas, neither of us over the course of three days came across the exact same elements in the exact same way other than a town that the story led us both to.  *In the overview of the world as seen in the picture on the box cover, every viewable (and not viewable) crevice is an entirely different world of exploration that is both gorgeous and fully interactive.Design: Arguably the best quality of Breath of the Wild is how the elements come together.  The expanse and themes, while Zelda, feel like they were taken out of the imagination of the renaissance 80s, a characteristic usually only touched on by unique cult-classic romps but here is fully realized in an immersive experience.  The characters have such a unique and retro feel that they are both unsettling and comforting in the same breath. From the music to the landscape to the vocals and setting, this game truly brings together all the design elements in a masterful way.CONS: (nit-picking; do not read this section) Amidst all of these amazing elements, there are a few potential improvements that could be made.1) There are not voice-overs for all NPC dialog.  This was a similar complaint that I had with the last 2 home console Zelda titles.  If the production values on the game are high enough to immerse you as this title has done, all NPC lines should be voiced rather than only a few.2) The obvious cloud shadows during high sun are so realistic that it makes you look up, however the clouds in the sky do not coincide with the shadows. Often I would expect to see a close cloud or a storm front coming in, and not have either.3) Some powers suffer from quirky control mapping.4) Simple textures and meshes often are crude for the sake of object and environment scope.  Forgiveable, but noticeable.5) The interactive detail in the game is so high that it is noticeable when Link's hands don't lineup with climbing elements or when objects quickly ""transition"" into items *cough* tree trunks *cough*6) Greatly miss the presence of at least a few major in-ground elements or dungeons.  Most of the world is the same ""trial"" format with huge surface landscapes.7) More purpose, depth, and variety in the lives of the NPC characters that inhabit Hyrule. (As far as engine planning, this element could require as much preparation as the development of the world itself.)8) Inability to change the view if needed. (When in a tree, avoiding being seen or fire from horseback bokoblins, the leaves and branches become too much of a visual obstruction from accurately shooting arrows or observing.*All of these will likely improve or appear in future Zelda games overtime.  Again, this game is the dawn of a new age and standard in game design.I have not been as satisfied and amazed with a game as I am with Breath of the Wild since Nintendo 64.  This game has the same feeling as the first arrival of Ocarina of Time, Mario 64, Link to the Past, Final Fantasy 7, Super Mario Brothers, and Super Mario World.  Up until now, nothing had dethroned Majora's Mask, Metroid Prime, and Ocarina of Time as my best, new favorite experiences, despite having played the large expanse and epic battles of Shadows of the Colossus, the emotional play of Resident Evil 4, the new learning approach and vicarious interactions of The Last Guardian, and nearly every other major release from Bethesda, Naughty Dog, and more. This game has surpassed all of my prior memories and claimed its rightful place as the game that defines gaming. I never thought I would feel that level of amazement again in the industry, but it is here and it isn't even VR.  Game design at it's finest and why Nintendo still remains the definitive development standard.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"edit: Sorry this turned into a long review. There's actually more I wanted to mention but it's already too long.I really wanted to give this 5 stars but couldn't quite get there.I'm not really sure how to frame this review. I'll try and make it generic and not have any plot spoilers. I played this game at least once a day for about 6 weeks (march 11th - april 24th). I don't know of a way to see an official our count but guessing I would say between 150 and 250 hours - when I did finally beat it - I did do a lot of optional things though. Also, I only played it almost entirely with the pro controller"" and a little bit with the Switch in portable-console-mode. Never used the detachable wireless controllers as a controller. I usually got around 2 1/2 - 3 hours as a portable by the way.I'll preface this by saying the last zelda i finished was Ocarina, 20 years ago. Haven't really kept up with Nintendo or zelda since then. Maybe some old zeldas through emulation. Still have TP and skyward sword on my ""to do list"".What would someone like me associate with a zelda game? A big over world with at least 8 dungeons of varying amounts of difficulty finding them, locked off areas that aren't accessible until certain items are found (like hookshot, the higher strength bracelet and the boomerang) and of course dungeons that include keys, a compass and a map.Well this zelda has a twist and that idea: instead of 8 fairly large dungeons and areas locked away until you get certain items...there's 120 relatively short shrines only four of which are required to complete the game. And there aren't really areas locked away until you get a specific item. Maybe an area is extremely difficult with only 3 hears and no stamina but it's not physically impossible to get there.This being an ""open world"" game I can't help but compare to other games of that kind, the freshest on my mind being the elder scrolls games. Skyrim for instance had weapon forging, marriages, a whole magical system, an economics system...far and away more complex than and in-depth than this in other words. But that's the way I have always remembered Zelda games: an ""RPG"" but much more ""accessible"" to kids and players who may not want to spend hundreds of hours doing everything. Actually if you were going to make an elder scrolls comparison Oblivion would be the most obvious in comparison (as I recall it had a lot of ...I want to say oblivion gates..that were optional to beat).In BotW you don't really ""level up"" and there isn't actually an experience system.  You finish shrines to get spirit orbs and then you upgrade either stamina (how long you can go before stopping to rest) or hearts (hit points). In other words you don't specialize in different skill sets. You can cook the best meal there is from the word go if you know the recipe and where to get the ingredients. And the same with archery and weapons skills: you don't get better and better at spears if you specialize in them, it's the same from the first moment as it is at the final fight. And I kind of like that.Over the course of my play through I went through several stages:1. starting the game, learning the controls, finding shrines and not towers with sheika slate scope, running from bokoblins...2. blowing myself up with bombs, continually crouching while trying to run away from mini-bosses, seeing that game over screen a lot3. being addicted to seeing what's over the next horizon, what's over there, staying up until 3am on a work night. This is probably the peak of the experience.4. having uncovered the whole map, having to track down those final shrines and finishing the side quests5. The final stage is kind of...frustrating. I didn't want to finish yet but there wasn't much left to do. The main point of side quests is get either money or ""mad loot"". But at some point I had ""four-starred"" my favorite armor and had 26k rupees so that kind of took away the motivation. So it was more ""farming mini bosses"" to get the ingredients and high level weapons I needed.So I would say you reach ""peak botw"" around 12 hearts with two divine beasts under your belt.What are the cons?- As mentioned before, I kept crouching and very inconvenient times. The analog stick that is used for movement/running, when pushed down, makes Link crouch. This frustrated me to know end. I really wish there was a ""disable crouch"" option, even if temporary. Would made things so much easier.- the technology used for the game is kind of...not powerful enough. For instance animals (or lizards) will run away and then simply disappear. For instances and dear will be right in front of me running circles and then just fade away right in front of me. I find this annoying. As is the sand seals and that can't pull me over rocks but can dive into rocks as if they were sand. It just seems like a lack of attention to detail or...maybe just a flaw in the technology. Really takes me out of the immersion.- The music. Or rather lack thereof. There's a appropriate sounds when something is chasing after Link or there's a mini-boss in the area. But a lot of times it's either generic ambient music or no music at all, just wind blow through trees. I realize Nintendo isn't on forefront of technology but if you're really going to leave out music how about some way of importing custom music? Pandora? Something? Probably too much to ask.- Even with the latest patch (as of april 25th 2017) I get some frame rate issues (I played with it on the dock/connected to a TV 99% of the time). Not very often and I don't remember it actually affecting game play. But that doesn't make it any less annoying.- I have the physical version of the game and sometimes those loading times kind of get to me. Feels like I'm in the early 90s waiting for my 1x CD ROM to load.  I did get a lot of tips for the loading screens, but I would still rather have faster loading.Neutral:- The weapon system. I think I figured out what they were going for: since there is no crafting or repair system for weapons and shields, this is the way the game upgrades your effectiveness. As you complete shrines and divine beasts the weapons slowly improve. Actually the enemies not all of them) slowly upgrade as well to be more difficult, thereby dropping improved weapons. It's supposed to be an organic thing, which it is up to a certain point.- the motion controls: technically they ""work"" but I didn't appreciate them for things like aiming the bow so the first thing I did was turn them off. There are still shrines that make you use them though.- the plot: not over the top great, no great twists or anything. Just a pretty straight forward thing. It's kind of like the plot of the movie ""the blues brothers"" now that I think about it. Link is ""getting the band back together"" for one last gig. And also bailing someone out of tough situation. Except link doesn't have a partner, it's just him trying to talk people into fighting again coming to the aid somebody. It's actually pretty impressive the way they pieced the plot together through these ""memories"" that are entirely optional and can be watched in any order yet still fits together into a cohesive whole by the end.- optional quests and mini-games. To expand your inventory capacity (for melee weapons/bows/shields) you have to trade in korok seeds. You find korok seeds but searching out of the way places for things that ""seem out of place"". Like a circle of rocks obviously missing a piece to make a full circle. Complete the circle, get a seed. Collect enough seeds and trade them for more inventory capacity. So you explore the world, solve some minor puzzles and in trade you ""earn"" more inventory space. It seems fair (I found just under 200 seeds, which sounds like a lot until you find out there's 900 total). There's also a take-a-pic-of-everything mini game thing. I was wondering at the start why there was no central repository explaining all the various enemies. And then I got the thing that allowed for photo taking. So it's ""build-your-own beastiary"". I don't know that there's a reward for a complete repository. But it is helpful. There's also some other mini-games like gliding for the longest and riding a shield down a snow path. Those are fun more than anything.- the way the monsters (and most everything else) re-spawns: I think I like it. I mean it's kind of explained in the context of the plot and it's relatively predictable. I once got stuck on a certain island the night before that re-spawn event. It was like living through ""groundhog day"" having to beat the island multiple times to try and finish it. In the ""late game"" you may start to plan all your adventures around the next re-spawn.Positives:- It is a very compelling open world. I spent many a night exploring random areas, trying to finish puzzles in shrines and fighting various mini bosses. It's often hard to put down.- the gained abilities from the start of the game makes it very fun to experiment. And the shrines make you ""think outside the box"" in your creative use of these abilities to solve the puzzle.- speaking of abilities, almost always when i couldn't figure out puzzle the answer seemed to be ""use crynosis"" (giant pillar of ice). Not sure why I had so much trouble remembering that was a thing.- I actually like a lot of the mini bosses. The Hinox (giant one-eyed things that seem to enjoy sleeping) were intimidating at first but eventually quite fun to fight. And a good source of relatively high power bows. Among other things.- the recipe/cooking system. I still don't know all the super-great recipes by name/by heart. But I know enough the create enhancements for speed/stealth/heart recovery/recovery+extra hearts/attack up/defense up/recover stamina/extra stamina wheels. And that's what I really want anyway. Never did figure out what good all those blocks of salt are for. Guess that's why I have hundreds of them.- I like the logic of the game. For instance in the starter area is a required shrine but the area is too cold to go through without losing hearts. You only have three hearts so this is rather important. There are hints of a recipe that will provide cold resistance as well as a way to get a warm vest. But I didn't know how to cook or that the ""warm doublet"" was an option. So as is probably logical i used a torch to provide just enough warmth to get through the cold area. Of course there are also bad guys to get through along the way and the torch goes out when you switch to a weapon so then you have to find some place to re-light a torch. You can also light wood weapons on fire of course. And actually where you start finding element enhanced weapons this works the same way: in the hot desert equip a great ice sword to stay a little cooler (and a fireblade to stay a little warmer). There's also things like ice-based enemies that die in one hit with a fire weapon, and fire enemies that die from ice weapons. Just makes sense.- Actually, you indirectly learn how to do with lightning strikes pretty quickly (if you have metal weapons equipped you'll likely get struck by lightning). And this knowledge comes in handy with the electricity-based puzzles (metal weapons conduct electricity). As does water. Comes in handy for disabling groups of enemies standing in water.- It seems like for every ""that's not fair"" element you find there is a ""that's very generous of you"" element to counter it. For instance it's not at all difficult to stumble across an enemy entirely over your head in abilities/hit points/etc. and can insta-kill you without much more than a look. As if to counter this you have the transportation/beam out ability you get pretty much first thing. At any moment/any time you can bring up the map and warp away without any consequences of any kind. About to drown? Or part way up a mountain and out of stamina? Laser about the take your head off? No problem, bring up the map and warp away. Doesn't cost any rupees or hearts or anything nor are there restrictions around enemies being around etc. Insta-gone.- the armor system: lets just say collect everything you see that you can pick up. Every much room, every firefly, every apple, every horn. Because you will need it, and I don't think there's any sort of limit to how big that stack of teeth can get (or I didn't find the limit, anyway). You'll need it to upgrade your armor, which you will want to do for the ""set bonus"". There's the fireproof suit for walking around on death mountain without instantly catching on fire. There's the rock climbing suit for super fast climbing, there's the sheika outfit for super-stealth, there also one for extreme cold and extreme heat. The one that allows for walking around inside in a volcano doesn't help for traveling in the desert. Not sure why. Point is you will probably want that extreme cold outfit upgrade so you're ""unfreezable"" and the rubber suite upgraded so your ""unshockable"". And extreme heat one so you're not dressed as...well lets not spoil the surprise.- the combat system: the sooner you learn the parry/super dodge system the better off you'll be. Took me forever to get the hang of it. But it's definitely worth it. Lets just say you can kill the guardians in the starter area with nothing more than a pot lid...How much one likes this game I think will be directly proportional to how open one is to open world games (like the elder scrolls series). I never had any trouble figuring out where to go or what to do next in this game (and Impa is there to remind you). The plot is entirely optional as are the ""divine beasts"" and 116 of 120 shrines. You can waste time time and do whatever you want in any random order you like. That's either terrifyingly flexible or wonderfully freeing, depending on your tastes. Think of it as a really watered down version of all the famous open world franchises. Which isn't a bad thing.One tip to leave you with: that area around Zora's domain, the long windy road with all the lizard men, that is definitely the place for gathering arrows. And you will run low on arrows...a lot. I was doing that every re-spawn time for a while there.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
I like the game it's fun to watch and play the one thing I wish it allowed you to use the sword attachment more than it does it makes you wait till you teach a certain point in the game before u can use it but *shrug* other than that it's a good game to play,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,1,2023,√âtats-Unis

"I want to start off by saying that this is the first Amazon Review I've ever written, so I hope it's of some use to at least one individual that stumbles upon it.Before I go into praising BotW I'd like to mention that there are frequent frame rate dips when playing the game on the Switch while docked. In handheld mode, this problem is all but nonexistent. Yes, there are times where it is noticeably annoying, but I would not go as far as to say that you shouldn't purchase this incredible game because of this issue.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild for the Nintendo Switch is a marvel to behold.Gameplay:The LoZ plays smoothly and responsively. When I first wrapped my fingers around the joy-cons and played this game, I felt like the placement of some of the commands felt a little out of place. Aside from the placement of the jump button (which can be changed) that forces you to claw the controller in order to run and jump, you end up getting used to the button layout. Unfortunately, there are a few connectivity issues with the joy-cons that Nintendo needs to improve upon, but if you're playing with a Pro Controller (highly recommended) than you won't need to worry about that. There are so many unique ways to combine food and other items in order to come up with creative dishes and elixirs to aid you during your journey. The combat is what you'd expect from a Zelda game, but with the inclusion of weapon durability and variety, no encounter is similar to the next. Also, Link can now scale almost anything due to a new climbing mechanic. It is the best feeling to climb up large mountains and look down at the gorgeous world that Nintendo has created for us. Sometimes you will reach the top of something just before running out of stamina, and I can honestly say that moments like these are what make the game feel so special.Difficulty:I wanted to touch on this a little bit because I for one don't consider many of the Zelda games to be especially difficult in terms of combat encounters, but this new entry changes that. If you're fighting multiple enemies at once, be prepared with a strategy beforehand or else get your butt handed to you. Enemies down the line will give you a hard time for sure.Environment:Breath of the Wild is a gorgeous game and saying that still doesn't do it justice. The art style fits perfectly with the series. The world is beautiful, vibrant, and very much alive. There will be moments where you'll just stop and enjoy the sunset just because of how much the weather impacts you throughout the game. After an entire night trying to climb cliffs in the rain, the sun rising and sky clearing is a brief moment of reprieve. The wildlife and assortment of plant life is extremely expansive in terms of diversity and uniqueness. There is just so much to look at. Not to mention, the map itself is HUGE! I've clocked almost 30 hours into the game and there are still many areas i have yet to explore. It's exciting to think about!Story and Characters:It's a Zelda game so you probably already know what to expect, but I think Nintendo has upped the game in this regard even still. The characters are each likable in their own way, and the relationships they have with each other make you enjoy the game even further. I don't want to go into too much detail about that for fear of spoilers but just know that the events of this story impact the characters in ways that give you an inviting insight into their emotions.Music and Voice Acting:The music is miraculous. Most of the time throughout your journey the only thing you will hear is the sounds... of nature. Birds chirping, deer running, horses galloping, rain falling, and lightning cracking. It's amazing! Of course when you enter a town or other occupied area, that's when the BotW soundtrack truly shines.This is the first time a Zelda game has included voice acting, and I'm here to tell you that you won't be disappointed. You will be very judgmental of the vocal performances at first, but that's only because it's SO WEIRD hearing real voices come from the characters that you've grown to know and love over the years. Once you get over that initial surprise you will begin to appreciate the performances, which I believe to be very well done. I absolutely love Zelda's voice actress. I was never a huge fan of the character myself, but I've adopted a whole new appreciation of the character by the way she's portrayed in this game.To wrap things up, I'd like to say that this game might be one of the few games ever created that is a MUST PLAY for anyone that's a fan of video games. It's just a fun, beautiful, memorable, and unique experience that anyone watching/playing can admire.I've played many incredible video games in my lifetime, but The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is the only one that forced me to write an Amazon Review.I'm absolutely positive that you will be 'blown away' by The Breath of the Wild ;)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I never thought that I would ever play this game because I was afraid that I would not be able to pass it. And my brother told me to play it and after 2 months of endless deaths, I got used to it. The main priority is to not die and explore everything in the massive environment which is full of dangers. It is a very entertaining game and it took a while to get used to your abilities and how and when to use them in and out of the shrines after extensive training you get better with progression especially after you defeat the first major monster. The main monsters are easy after the first hit to their weakness they easily go down. I am replaying this game for the 3rd time and waiting for the next one in about 5 full months.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,12,2022,√âtats-Unis

"This is how you revitalize a franchise that was starting to grow stale in it's formula. I bought a Switch just to play this game and I do not regret my purchase. I'm going to go over pros and cons to make this review a little easier to read.PROS:+ HUGE OPEN WORLD - Lots of interesting places and things to discover. It's quite exhilarating to scale a mountain in order to get a better view of everything around you and then paraglide to points of interest. If you can see a place on the map, you can get to it.+ COMBAT EXPERIMENTATION - Combat experimentation is fun and rewarding, for awhile (more explanation in 'cons' section).+ FUN AND VARIED COMBAT (FOR AWHILE) - Different enemy types are interesting and have specific tactics that clearly telegraph their moves making combat a rewarding learning experience and almost never feels cheap.+ RPG ELEMENTS - The RPG elements fit very nicely into the Zelda universe and give the game a lot of depth. Mountable horses have different stats, enemies can have different elemental types along with stronger variations, weapons, armor, and shields have wildly different stats and abilities, food and elixirs provide different buffs, etc.+ GAME DIFFICULTY - The game is relatively difficult compared to previous Zelda games. You really have to assess combat situations before entering the fray and many enemies are punishing. You will die, many times, but you do learn, with time, and with learning comes triumph and satisfaction. DLC adds Master Mode for the most hardcore players or those who found Normal too easy.+ COOKING SYSTEM - Cooking system is deep and rewards experimentation. Cooking not only allows for the crafting of meals and elixirs which gives you numerous buffs, but it's also one of the best ways to make money.+ WEAPON DURABILITY - Weapon and shield durability forces you to continually hunt for new gear and keeps combat interesting and tense. While I didn't think I would like this system at first, it makes for a much more engaging game than just getting a single, over-powered item and just relying on that the rest of the game, which would get boring, imo.+ SHRINES - There's over 120 'shrines' which are peppered all over the map which act like mini-dungeons. They usually can be completed in 10 minutes or less and usually involve the use of several of Link's Runes (that you get at the beginning of the game) that give you the ability to move metallic objects from a distance, throw bombs, summon ice pillars, or even freeze objects and apply force to them to launch into enemies or to other places to help solve puzzles. I love these shrines because they're fun to solve, and due to the game's physics engine, many can be solved in ways the developers probably didn't intend (look up YouTube videos on it). Shrines are short enough that they're not a huge time investment like normal Zelda dungeons that used to demand an hour+ of your time to complete, making them ideal for short gaming sessions.+ NO HAND HOLDING - Doesn't explain much, doesn't hold your hand, and expects you to learn everything from the world, NPCs, and experimentation.CONS:- BARREN FEELING OPEN-WORLD - The world feels very barren and empty, much of the time. Many say the map is 'dense' but I don't think that's an accurate word to describe it. The map is loaded with things to do, but there is lots of empty space between those points of interest. Think if you took the map of Skyrim (a game I would call 'dense') and expanded it by 3 times the size, including time to travel between points of interest. Horses don't really help with traversal especially when you're moving across mountainous or rocky terrain.- COMBAT GETS STALE - Combat experimentation becomes less effective as you become stronger. Ambushes with bombs, chu chu jellies, stasis, etc, all become less and less rewarding as enemies become stronger. Before, a carefully aimed bomb could kill an enemy, outright, or roll into barrels which would take out an entire encampment, now a bomb does roughly 5% damage and most other means are hardly worth the effort over just using brute-force. For a game that really rewarded this kind of behavior at the start, I was bummed that I couldn't rely on those tactics later in the game, adding to the combat feeling stale and repetitive after awhile.- CAN'T SUMMON HORSES FROM ANYWHERE - Horses cannot be summoned from anywhere. The DLC solves this with 2 different solutions, but it should have been in the base game and been an early quest/reward before you spend 50+ hours exploring the map. This was super frustrating to me when walking to Gerudo town, which ended up being close to 25 minutes of walking/running from the nearest shrine. A horse would have made this trek much more bearable but there were no stables nearby to even take it out of.- INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND GENERAL UI - Inventory management and the menu UI could use a little work. While I loved having so many interesting items and ingredients to discover and experiment with, moving through the menus got tedious, especially when you have multiple pages of stuff to sort through or when you find new, better weapons/shields and have to go back into your menus to drop some to make space. Menus felt cluttered and even after 80 hours, I would still fumble through menus trying to do specific things.- PERFORMANCE AND LOAD TIMES - The game runs pretty well a majority of the time, but there are certain places where it will chug, specifically when there's lots of particle effects on-screen or there's a lot of things to render. This also makes load times get kind of old, as it can take up to 20 seconds to load into new areas or even just reload the area you are in, after dying. Even dying in a shrine results in a 10 second reload, which is baffling since they're not in the open-world and shouldn't take that long to render, especially when they've already been rendered before your death.- GRAPHICS - While the game looks pretty good most of the time, there's other times that the hardware limitations really show, like when you're trekking across big meadows or rocky mountains with little detail. It looks really good for a handheld system, but doesn't quite hold up to console standards, even compared to last gen.- EXPLAINS NOTHING - While I love that the game doesn't hold your hand, I was equally frustrated by not having a clue how to do certain things. While a purist would argue that all the answers are SOMEWHERE in the game or that you should just experiment, someone like me just doesn't have the patience to play 90% of the games content to then find out that a certain ability will significantly help map traversal and reduce travel time. I want to know these things up-front or at the latest, halfway through the game, since getting an ability to improve travel time feels less rewarding when I've already slowly trekked through a vast majority of the map at 60 hours. DLC rewards are not as great if you have nearly completed and covered the entire base game... what's the use of a horse or motorcycle you can summon anywhere if you don't have anything left to explore?Anyways, I absolutely love this game. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with it, I felt like a 4 is a fair score. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,7,2018,√âtats-Unis

This is the greatest game I've ever played!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,2,2023,√âtats-Unis
"I've put somewhere between 50-75 hours into this game and I have to say that I just don't get the gushing, unqualified love for this game.  In fact, after about 10-15 hours, I was pretty close to just giving up on it, but I kept playing it expecting for it to click.  It never did.  In my view, it's a OK game, but that's it.  It's not the best game on the Switch, and it's not the best game in its genre.The good:- The developers obviously put a lot of time into the game, and it shows.  There are a lot of different landscapes, the artwork is interesting, and I can only remember one bug in all the time that I played.  It is a polished, finished game.  Especially with large, open-world games, that's pretty rare, and I appreciate that.- The controls are solid, although there is some awkward button-mashing required in spots that can be frustrating.  This is particularly true for the dodge mechanic, which requires a three-button combination that, if not executed just right, will just result in a crouch that gets you clobbered by a bad guy.- It's suitable for children, which is nice.  Few of these types of games are.The not so good:- The game is awfully repetitive.  There is a really big, open, world, and that's great.  Many of the areas have different artwork and are pretty to look at.  But really, most of the territories are basically the same with different artwork layered over the top.-With a big, open world, you would expect that there would be a lot to do.  There's really not, at least as far as I can tell.  There is a main quest and there is discovering shrines.  There are a handful of side quests, but they're pretty one-dimensional and involve either discovering a shrine or running an errand for someone.  Other games like this (Fallout, Skyrim, Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn, GTA, etc.) have some pretty involved B stories that can be just as good as the main game.-BOTW is full of some interesting ideas that are executed in a way that just makes the game too tedious and downright boring in spots.  For example:- There are something like 120 shrines to discover.  That sounds like a lot, but all the shrines fall into one of three categories:  a fight, a platformer, or a puzzle.  Every shrine is a variation of one of those three, and with 120, that gets pretty old.  In Fallout 3, a much better game, each Vault had a different story and was relatively unique.  Because of that, they were quite fun and interesting to explore.  There's nothing interesting about the shrines in BOTW once you play the first few.  Beating the shrines is important to level up your character, though, so there is a lot of repetitive grinding.- There are a lot of mountains and cliffs in the game.  It makes for interesting landscape, and you can climb them, which is a cool and different idea, but climbing is very slow, and some of the cliffs are quite big.  It's just boring to sit there for 45-60 seconds doing nothing but holding the climb button.  Worse, sometimes it rains and the cliffs become too slick to climb.  But if you need to go up the cliff to get where you're going, there is nothing to do but stand there and wait for it to stop raining.  I've actually just put down the controller and left to make myself a sandwich while I waited for it to stop raining.  What's the point of that?-Speaking of rain, the weather changes.  That's neat I guess, but they've messed it up by making it a game mechanic.  Sometimes it will storm, so if you are holding a metal weapon or a metal shield, you'll get struck by lightning and die (this also causes an inventory management problem, which I discuss below).  It rains a lot in the game but doesn't always storm, so it's easy to miss when it starts if you're not paying attention.  You'll just be wandering around and then get struck by lighting and instantly die.  That's annoying.  It also goes from extreme hot to extreme cold rather quickly.  If you don't have the proper clothing, you will die very quickly.  So for example, in the desert, the daytime is very hot and the nighttime is very cold; each require special outfits.  This might be realistic, but time passes quickly and it gets old to have to keep changing outfits every five minutes.  Again, how is this a fun game mechanic?-There is a big, open-world map, so getting from place to place can be tedious.  Other open-world games, like Fallout or Witcher, solve this problem by being able to fast travel basically anywhere.  You can fast travel in BOTW, too, but you are limited to being able to fast travel only to two types of locations:  towers and shrines.  That means that after you fast travel, you often have a lot of walking (or worse, climbing) to get to where you want to go.  That's boring.  You can also get a horse, but because so much of the map is mountainous, their utility is rather low.- Your weapons and shields deteriorate.  That's fine, plenty of other games have done that.  But in those games, there is a way to repair your equipment.  In this game, there isn't, and most of the weapons will deteriorate very quickly--just a handful of fights with monsters.  So you have this perverse incentive when you get good weapons to not use them because of a concern that they will break and then you won't have them later for the boss battles or occasional more powerful monster that you run across.-  By itself, the deterioration issue probably wouldn't be terrible.  When it is combined with a limited inventory and specialized weapons, it becomes downright awful.  You only have a few weapons slots, but you have to horde weapons because you never know when they might break.  Worse, some monsters a particularly vulnerable to a single type of weapon--ice sword, fire sword, etc.  So you always want to make sure you have one of each of those.  And, when it storms, you can't use a metal weapon, so you have to keep a wooden weapon, too.  You wind up always fretting about what weapons to keep and which to drop, and when.  It's frustrating to drop a weapon that you need later because you didn't have room for it at the time.  It's just unnecessary.-To recover health, you have to cook meals in a pot.  That's fine, but it takes a lot of time and clicks to gather items out of your inventory and then a few more seconds for them to actually cook.  It doesn't sound like much, but if you want to prepare 10-15 meals to prepare for a boss battle (or because you don't have the proper equipment and need the temporary boost that a meal provides), it's really tiresome to sit at the fire and do stuff over and over again.- There are really only a handful of different monsters you fight.  The monsters that you meet in the first few minutes of the game will be seen through the rest of the game, except more powerful.  When you go to a new area, it's basically the same monsters, except there is an ""ice"" version, a ""fire"" version, or a ""skeleton"" version.In sum, the bones are here for a good game, but it's just not a good game.  I can tell they put a lot of work into the game, and for that I am appreciative.  But gosh, shouldn't the game be fun?  Three stars is as high as I can go, and that might even be a bit generous.If you like the open world game, you've probably already played many of the games that are far and away better than BOTW.  Fallout 3, New Vegas, Skyrim, GTA and Witcher (available on Switch) are clearly better.  If you are looking for an open world game that is suitable for a child, Lego City Undercover (available on Switch) is better than BOTW, and usually half the price.  If you also have a PS4, Horizon Zero Dawn is a game that has the same motif as BOTW, but is much, much better in nearly every way.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2020,√âtats-Unis

"I'll start this review by saying I've played a lot of Zelda games. As in nearly all of them, including any remakes and spin-offs. And while Breath of the Wild was groundbreaking in a lot of ways, I feel like it could have done better in certain aspects.Things I liked:The Open World - I absolutely loved the idea that you could run straight to Ganon if you so desired (and promptly get destroyed, but who cares?). And the fact that the world was so MASSIVE made it even more fun - there was always something undiscovered, something new with each and every playthrough. And the effects of the different areas, such as death by cold or heat, or weather conditions such as lightning, were awesome.The Monsters - the monsters were both challenging AND entertaining. I loved fighting them, and they were difficult enough that I've probably died more in this game than in any other Zelda game. I also really liked how they would react with certain weapons and situations, such as yelling at you in outrage if you stole their weapons, or would look around their surroundings for another item to throw at you (Moblins throwing other monsters, for example)The Clothes - I liked the styles for each individual outfit, and the benefits one could get if they fully upgraded them. However, in the end, I settled on making Link run around in nothing but his boxers for both the challenge and for the hilarity of it, but the fact that it's POSSIBLE makes it even better. Also the cross-dressing.Side-Quests - The sheer number of them was great, and some of the side missions (Pond of Love, anyone?) were hilarious and new.Cooking - the fact that you could forage, and create items that would heal you, or give you stealth boosts, or enhance your endurance, was new and a good addition to the game. No more having to rely on just four bottles! If you get hit and you're dying, you can eat fifty apples to get back on track (and you WILL get several hundred apples over the course of the game).Weapons - This is a love-hate relationship. I loved all the different weapons that you could get in the game, but I hated how QUICKLY they broke. Some of them were really cool/funny (The Castle Guard Series, the mops/brooms, the Lynel Weapons), but the fact that they broke so swiftly made getting them kind of pointless at times. And the fact that the Master Sword broke too was annoying, even if it recharged after a couple of minutes.The Divine Beasts - These are so COOL. I love the whole steampunk look, but also the fact that each divine beast has different functions and challenges made it more fun. And there were multiple ways to defeat the Blights, so what might work for some people wouldn't work for others.The Music - so simple and so soothing. The music itself is amazing, and perfectly sets the mood for the game. I especially liked the music for the Rito Village (and Revali's theme), Tarrey Town, and the Ganon battles. It's an excellent soundtrack, and it's not the first time I've wished that Zelda also released official albums for their games.Lack of a Companion - one thing that always irritated me about previous Zelda games was the annoying companion that followed you around (Midna being the only exception from Twilight Princess). But in this game, there's none of that, which is really nice.Master Mode - SO HARD. It forces you to be creative in some of your fights, and it made me angry enough to rage quit on the Master Sword DLC, which I've never done before. Basically, it's very challenging.Things I didn't like:The Shrines - There are 120 of them, and some of them are trial by combat, some of them are puzzles, and some of them are memory-based with no hope of remembrance (Dueling Peaks, I'm looking at you). They were fun at first, but after a while, they got exhausting. But unfortunately, they're necessary if you want more hearts and stamina. The only shrine I really, absolutely liked, was the one on Eventide Island, because Survival Man is my jam. Honestly, I wish they had a couple of traditional Zelda dungeons thrown in with the shrines - it would have made the game much better in my opinion.The Weapons - as mentioned aboveThe Korok Seeds - there are over 800 of these mofos scattered around the map. EIGHT HUNDRED. And there's a limit as to how much you can expand your weapon/shield/bow stash, even if you DO find all 800 of them, which makes a good majority of the Korok seeds useless. If there were like 200 of these to find, I probably wouldn't have been so aggravated trying to find them all, but no, there's over 800 and there's no point for most of them.The Story - one thing I've greatly enjoyed about the Zelda series is the story. And while BOTW does offer one, it's a little...lacking. The only thing I really enjoyed about it was the development of Zelda's character, which was the only substantial part of the story. There's too many things to do, and not enough story to support it. Just quick little flashbacks that almost feel like afterthoughts. I don't mind the whole memory loss thing, I just wish there was more to the plot of the game.The Voice Acting - Don't get me wrong, I love how they even HAD voice acting in the first place. I just wish they picked BETTER voice actors. The only ones I liked were Urbosa, Mipha, and Revali. The others...not so much.Calamity Ganon - they build him up as the big bad, the one you MUST defeat, the hardest villain of all...and then it's a disappointment. The only time it got difficult for me was when it teleported me into the field with my horse, and I happened to have Ganon's giganto horse with me at the time, which unfortunately can't sprint.Overall, I really liked the game - while some parts were lacking, it was very different compared to other, more traditional Zelda games. It's very easy to get sucked into it and to lose months of your life to it. And I would recommend the DLCs. They're not super expensive, and they add more challenge and bonuses to the game, as well as more story (and what feels like an actual Zelda dungeon and boss fight!). So Four out of Five Stars.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
"(no spoilers)It's no ""Ocarina of Time"" or even ""Majora's Mask"" but I gotta say, Breath of the Wild is great. IMO better than Wind Waker and Twilight Princess combined! I don't normally jump on the hype train but between the Nintendo Switch and Zelda, I decided to go for it. Now, I wouldn't say this is ""the greatest game of all time!!!!!"" like most claim but it is quite epic.Here's a detailed list of my likes/dislikes:Likes:+ Combat ~ the combat is incredibly smooth. It can be challenging at times, but easy to maneuver.+ Graphics ~ while the graphics may seem lacking at first, after a couple hours the game looks beautiful. It's definitely unique and looks good in both 720p and 1080p. (handheld vs tv mode)  Same goes for games like Wind Waker or Tell Tale TWD: after you get into the mindset, they look nice.+ Storyline ~ I haven't had a stale minute yet. The main storyline is interesting and it even has cinematics/cutscenes! (I'm hoping the main storyline is very long)+ Horses ~ I really dig the new horse system. I'll always love Epona but Epona2 will manage.+ Weapons ~ I love the fact that all weapons have durability. Yes, your weapon won't last forever and you will have to replace it (sometimes within a few swings) but this keeps the combat very fresh and interesting. AND there is a huge array of weapons which is fantastic any way you slice it. You will be forced to pick up a few tree branches from time to time.+ Cooking ~ the amount of different foods/supplies/recipes is nuts! Mix anything together and it will pop out a new recipe.+ Armor ~ woot! many different armor models with set bonuses! Even helmets :D+ Treasure Hunts ~ there are many different easter eggs/open world puzzles/etc out there. If you see something peculiar, go check it out. Odd's are, you will find something of rarity. It could be a strange looking landmark or a hidden hole in the ground, every moment is a breath of fresh air. I feel like I'm on survivor and keep spotting potential hidden immunity landmarks lol.+ Open World ~ this is a double edged sword IMO, I will explain below. However, one of the most jaw-dropping features of this game is how massive it is. Especially when its capable on a handheld. And the loading screens are rare yet speedy.Dislikes:- Soundtrack ~ this is severely lacking. Most of the game is quiet. Yes, its great hearing the sounds of nature all around you but most games have both.- Settings ~ I guess this applies to the Nintendo Switch as well but there are minimal settings to choose from. For example, there is an in-game tracker that makes beeping noises. I wanted to turn it down, however there are absolutely 0 audio settings. This means you cannot adjust music volume, dialog etc.- Controls ~ the controls are VERY funky compared to the average console. I don't understand why every platform insists on using a different layout but it makes it difficult for everyone. Zelda BOTW controls on a PS4 controller would look like this: X is the back button, Triangle is the sprint button, Circle is the interact button, Square is the attack button. You can change the controls very mildly, the settings only allow you to switch sprint with back (X vs Triangle). In this day and age, you should be able to map out any keybinds you wish.-  Played Time ~ again, for being 2017 without this feature is beyond me. Most games show you how long you've played your saved game. IE 7days 5hours etc. However, Zelda BOTW does not. This is a very convenient feature to have for, say, making a review. I haven't manually kept track of how long I've played unfortunately, it would be nice to be able to include that in my review.- Inventory Space ~ you do expand it eventually but, man, sometimes your weapons don't break fast enough in order to pick more up. You'll be constantly throwing your weps just to make room.- Side Quests ~ I haven't played a huge amount of time but as I've seen, I've wished there were more frequent side quests. My biggest concern with a game is blowing through a main storyline too quickly.- Camera ~ as I've said before, there are minimal settings to choose from. One of the options is to adjust camera sensitivity/speed, EXCEPT its missing two separate settings for vertical/horizontal camera speeds. It is combined (to the best of my knowledge). So in example, I am using the setting ""Fast"" but it is too fast for vertical panning yet way too slow for horizontal panning. This is a huge pain in the butt because if I adjust it to ""Very Fast"" then my horizontal camera speed will be good but the vertical camera speed will be uncontrollable.- Open World ~ its a like/dislike for me. Although, I love huge open worlds, there must be some order to a video game. BOTW seems to drop you into a world with little direction. Which, personally I enjoy but it's risky for losing interest faster. A goal is always needed, I've noticed sometimes that goal is hard to spot.Well, thats it. There are many more points I could touch but I may be ranting at this point. I hope I helped at least one person with this review! My overall statement would be to give this game a fighting chance. Ignore the hype, ignore the name ""Zelda"" slapped on the cover. Just play the game with no reservations. If you like it, you like it. In my opinion, the first hour or two was a little dull. I almost let the hype disappoint me but after playing a few more hours, I really started to enjoy it. And now each day that I continue to play it, I get more hooked. It was well worth shelling out the bucks for a Nintendo Switch+accessories AND breath of the wild.This is a 5 star game! Recommended!...but 4 stars because of the lack of settings mostly...and also my Zelda:BOTW game box came cracked, it is missing one of the latches completely so the game case doesn't stay closed. In addition, it wasn't sealed. It was loosely covered in plastic that had clearly been opened. Used or not, it works just fine so I can't complain. (okay maybe a little lol)",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"After years of hearing about how BotW is the best Zelda game ever -- and possibly even the best overall game ever! -- I finally bought a copy to play through for myself. My summary below is based on my ~80 hours of BotW playthrough. With the exception of about 200 of the 900 total korok seeds, I completed virtually all aspects of the game, including completing all 120 shrines and freeing all four divine beasts.First, the good: the overworld! Yeah, BotW simply nails the overworld! There are sooo many ways to interact with the overworld that you really feel immersed in the game when you play. The physics engine is very nice and full of possibilities largely constrained only by the player's creativity. Ans simply roaming through the overworld and ""doing things"" without any particular agenda whatsoever is easily the greatest draw of the game, IMHO.However, the not-so-good is plentiful.1) Repetition: Sure, the first 20 hours or so of gameplay are amazing and filled with tons of new discoveries. However, the remaining 60+ hours are highly similar with virtually no novelties. I'll give two examples:a) All 120 shrines are extremely similar. None of them have bosses (sorry, the occasional guardian doesn't count). Many are completely empty of any enemy whatsoever. While the first 20 or so are clearly designed to teach you game mechanics, the remaining 100 are a virtually pointless waste of time. Unless you have a 100% completion fetish, there is just no reason to complete more than the bare minimal needed number of shrines. They really start to become an annoyance after about 30 or so. If you have ever played Castlevania 2 with its ""seemingly-unfinished mansions"", you'll likely have deja vu here.b) Kurok seeds. Believe it or not, the problem isn't that there are 900 of them. The problem is that virtually all of them have one of about 15 possible solutions. I mean, the first time you see a circle of rocks with a missing stone, it's fun to play around until you figure out to place a stone in the open spot. But after you've seen such a circle of rocks FORTY SEVEN times, the repetition becomes unpalatable.2) Destructible Weapons: I see what the developers were trying for here, but man oh man, it just doesn't work. Most weapons are good for 10-20 hits and then they irreparably break. This mechanism is present from the start of the game, including whatever weapon you very first pick up (most likely a tree branch). The impact on how this affects the player is predictable: the player learns from the get-go to run from enemies when at all possible and hoard their weapons like they are sacred cows. Sure, I could use the amazing axe I just found on this very hard enemy in front of me, but what if there is an even harder enemy just down the road that I'll wish I had saved it for? The player ends up going for ""safe boring kills"" wherein they find a spot sheltered from the enemy where they can lob bombs at the enemy over and over and over and over ... and over again until they finally die. Did I mention repetitious? I bet most players finish the game with a hoard of 10+ very strong weapons that they were too afraid to ever use.3) Lack of an All Encompassing Story Line: Nearly everything in BotW is optional. There are entire sections of the overworld that never need to be stepped in to complete the main quest. Virtually all of the Zelda series predecessor games tied their numerous sub-quests into the the main quest. You always felt like whatever you were doing was being done because it would directly lead to completing the main quest. But in BotW the numerous side-quests (and yes, there are numerous of them -- 76!) feel pointless and unrelated to anything at all. Go hunt down a special herb so a husband can make a special dinner for his wife and give you something pointless in return for your efforts.All that being said, the overworld in BotW is a lot of fun to play with. I suspect the overworld and its playing mechanisms were first developed, and when the developers realized how much fun it was just to pointlessly play around in it, they decided to try to integrate a Zelda story into it.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,9,2022,√âtats-Unis

"How do you make the Legend of Zelda relevant again? By destroying the definition of what a game like the Legend of Zelda is supposed to be. Where do I start with this game? How about the fact you really go can anywhere you want- horizontally and vertically. How about the fact the physics in this game actually matter and you can truly manipulate and approach every situation differently because of it. How about adding voice acting and cutscenes and some of the best writing I have ever read in a video game?I don't know where to begin(just like the game). I have been preparing for a hardcore open world game in Hyrule for years. I knew that eventually, Nintendo would take Zelda in this direction so I needed to prepare myself. It all started with Portal 1 and 2, then Skyrim, then the Last of Us, then the Souls series and Bloodborne. Each of the game series I listed you can see influenced the final product. From the quick, challenging and fun puzzles( just like Portal) in the shrines and dungeons. The open world discovery from Skyrim, the survival aspect and utilizing all your resources like the Last of Us, and the difficult but rewarding enemy and boss encounters like the Souls series.It also borrows from the Ubisoft model of climbing a tower to open up a portion of the map but unlike the Ubisoft model nothing shows up on the map. You need to find and mark the locations you need to explore. I play with HUD off which helps me really learn the environment and look at the map like a true adventure. It is so refreshing to venture off into a large land mass because you see something in the horizon. I spent 4 hours last night just exploring and find new secrets that I missed in the beginning area. I am currently in the eastern part of the map and I had a feeling in my gut I needed to go back to where it all started since I had new equipment and understood the world design better. Man, I beat two Guardians, got 15 Korok seeds, finish 8 shrines and just discovered parts of the map that are wonderous.If you want your hand to be held and everything to be easy, this game is not for you. It is not as hard as a Dark Souls or Bloodborne but you can make it that hard if you want by venturing into areas with underpowered equipment. This game has spoiled me. I can't look or play other games now if the gameplay isn't tight and the world isn't magical. I play games to lost myself and forget about the issues of my life and the world. I don't care about graphics. I want to have fun, I want a challenge. I want to use my brain as well as my skills to get through a tough area or boss. Every time I fail, I know it is because of me. Either I am rushing, not mentality ready for the fight, or overlooking an aspect of the game.This game is easily in my top 5 favorite games of all time. Not sure of the rankings yet but I worry for Portal 2 and FF7. That's it- go out and get it. The Wii U is the only Nintendo system I never owned. The Switch is fantastic. I do recommend a pro controller. I use the pro controller for tough fights since I need the dexterity. But I play on the handheld when I just want to explore areas with enemies I know I can beat while looking for new shrines to complete. If you don't have money for a console and one of the greatest games ever just wait till the Holidays. But if you are like me and hate cookie cutter games like Ubisoft open-world games(Rayman Legends is awesome) then please go get this game. You will not regret it.Update: What I said above is true about this game up to a certain point. I just beat the main story, 90 shrines, 150 korok seeds and good amount of side quests completed. First off, I hate Calamity Ganon and everything Hyrule Castle. It is the worst part of the game. I will not ruin the game here but for a game where you spend 80-90 hours being creative and doing different puzzles, this area is not creative and just a fight fest. I did not struggle with any of the battles before Ganon but you can avoid them all if you wish. There are no puzzles to get to Ganon. It was the most disappointing boss battle in the game.I have dropped the score to a 4.5 because the mini bosses on the world map are always fun, everything else is fun in the game but I would recommend beating the game either as soon as possible or doing everything else before facing Ganon. I just cannot play any longer. After 115 hours, I felt it was time to beat Ganon. Those 5 hours walking to the castle, and telling I will not skip any area to get to Ganon felt like a chore. Still a fantastic game that suffers from the usual RPG issue of overstaying its welcome and having lackluster final boss.Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, A Link to the Past are all still better games since they did not leave me with this sour taste at the end. I might change my mind in the future but this is my fresh update after watching the credits.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I feel truly compelled to write a review for breath of the wild as a veteran of nearly every other Zelda game previously released.  This review contains content spoilers in reference to what you can expect when you play the game, but doesn't contain any story or plot spoilers.For the first five days I had this game, I logged over 48 hours.  I lived, dreamed (literally), and thunk breath of the wild and I could not get enough.Then, after about getting half way through the main quest (there are minor side quests), I found myself seriously struggling to proceed further in the game.Let me break it down:1. The good.This game has outstanding graphics by comparison of other Zelda games.  The open world environment is a fantastic experience that gives you universal freedom to do whatever you want, the entire scope of Hyrule is open to you immediately.  Each corner of the map is an entirely different environment that is also athletically unique.  The jungles have immense amounts of waterfalls to explore, Death Mountain has rocks you can mine, the desert has hills that stretch for miles, and Hyrule field is a largely open area where the possibilities are endless.The greatest new feature of this game is Links ability to climb basically anything that is in his/your way.  You could spend an entire day just doing this, see a mountain in the distance?  All you have to do is get to the base and have at it, (it's a little more technical than this) and this aspect opens up Hyrule in a way never seen before.  The game also contains various side quests which give the title a bit more depth than in the past where it is A) Find Zelda. B) Get Master Sword. C) Restore power to Master Sword. D) Kill Ganon/ Ganondorf2. The bad.Like I said earlier, this game gets old, fast.  This is because the things that you have to do in the game to truly advance your character (gain heart containers and the new stamina vessels), are extremely repetitive.  The new Shrine system tasks Link with completing small puzzles of different natures all over the map (these locations also serve as fast travel points) and each shrine takes between 5-20 minutes on average.  You gain ""Spirit Orbs"" which you then exchange for Heart Containers or Stamina Vessels.  This is very different than traditionally, as you either collected ""Pieces of Hearts"" or gained Heart Containers through boss battles.  There are 120 shrines in total, and after about 50, you find yourself having to force yourself to complete them.Another new aspect is the multiple sets of armor, shields, bows, and melee weapons Link can use; BUT most importantly: Weapon Durability.  This is a pivotal complaint among those who have critiqued this game from a slightly negative aspect, as a weapons durability (while variable) really only seem to last for about 3-4 monster encounters.  You constantly find yourself weighing if its worth wasting a very rare weapon you find on weaker level enemies, because you know in your mind it WILL break, and succumb to using multiple weaker-weapons you find very early in the game saving that one special sword or shield for the few large scale monster encounters you do have.Likewise, the armor you find has stat boosting abilities (increased sneak, increased climbing speed, or heat resistance) and you find yourself changing armor on the fly multiple times every couple of minutes depending on what it is that you are doing.  While not as bad as the issue of weapon durability, it invariably becomes a chore.3. The ugly.This games ultimate downfall is the elimination of what made the classical Zelda games, Zelda games.  From turning the recovery of the Master Swords into an option (be it that the game highly recommends it), to the fact that you don't have the ability to use Links stereotypical green armor until you complete an achievement that spans the entire game, it felt like while they kept Link in name, they stripped him of everything that made him who we recognize.To further build on this, the game has eliminated another core element of what made The Legend of Zelda, well, The Legend of Zelda: Dungeons.  IIm not kidding, BOW does not contain a single dungeon other than the very, very last steps of the game. Instead, there is the Shrine system (not attached to any sort of quest, but is essential if you want more than three hearts), as well as a few ""large puzzles"" that take you through the main quest.  I'll leave it to reader interpretation as to what that means for boss battles. . .With the removal of dungeons, Link also looses his access to the tools that he would gain throughout the series in previous titles.  The hook-shot, iron boots, ball & chain ect. are non-existent.  While the replacement system of the Runes is a decent attempt by Nintendo to reconcile this, it felt cheap and frankly?  They're boring to use, and almost useless in combat.To finally end what now feels like a nostalgic rant, the variety of monsters in BOW is the smallest variation you could hope for.  Honestly, there are about four different types of ""grunt level"" monsters you encounter throughout the entire game, three larger sub-variants of these same smaller monsters, and two beasts that actually pose a series threat to you throughout the game.  BOW instead utilizes a color system to differentiate the difficulty they present (Red, Blue, Black, and sometimes Silver) , and instead of having a large scope of monsters throughout the game- you encounter the same monsters from the start of the game, through the very end.I really hate to be the debby downer.  Especially when it comes to the foundational game that developed my love for video games, but this game didn't feel like a true Zelda title.  It felt like it wanted to take the successful plot line which has kept me a fan for years and apply that to a different games world.  If I had to deal with only ""the bad"" I think I could at least give this game four stars, the only reason I can give it three is because those first five hours were exhilarating.

"I just wanted to update my review for the game. There's no doubt this game deserves a 5 star score. It's bold and Nintendo created a world that's bigger than any game to date. I want to point out that I did beat the game and completed most of the dungeons that are spread out throughout the game. I'm sure by now you've heard all the good and great things about the game, but there should be the negative as well.First, I did not like how Nintendo undermined the weapon system. Weapons and shields break too often. How does this effect the game? You're travelling the vast land, yet you feel reluctant to fight the moblins and goblins because you don't know if it will be worth it for your item to break. Even ""unbreakable"" items can wear out and need time to recharge.Second, if Nintendo wanted to make the travelling worth while combat and fighting should reward you. Sure there are items and chests to gain if you take over a moblin base, but the items are often not worth it. I would see someone trying to make the case that you need to battle enemies to gain their parts to upgrade armor, but once you upgrade, fighting becomes pointless. There's no experience gained or leveling up, so why not just run away most of the time. I have played Horizon Zero Dawn and in my opinion, HZD's battles felt more Zelda-like than Botw. The weapons and items in HZD seemed to have more value than BOTW. Enemies take more strategy to beat in HZD and every weapon had a purpose to defeating an enemy with a weakness to it. I'm not saying HZD is a better game or BOTW is a better game mind you. I'm not trolling Zelda, I gave it a 5 star score. For those who played both games, you will see what I am talking about with the enjoyment of battles in HZD.Third, bosses have been simplified. You do not need a special item or much strategy to beat the bosses. In past Zelda's the dungeon's secret item would be the weakness to the boss. But in BOTW all you need is a strong weapon and armor to beat bosses. The bosses were not overly creative. Each boss was only marginally different from the previous.Where are the iconic items? Where is the boomerang, the hookshot,, heavy boots, bug net, fairy bottles, etc, etc. Items were a central theme in all the Zeldas. Why did they take that out? It was one of the biggest surprises or exciting parts of previous games when opening a chest. Putting value into items is something I would like to see reinstated in future games.Fourth, the epic field music is gone and replaced by a subtle piano and atmospheric tunes. In all of the previous Zeldas, I would be either humming or whistling tunes from Zelda for days after I had finished. Yes, the game does have one theme that reoccurs when something important happens or when you beat a boss, or when you find a stable, but not a very memorable soundtrack.Fifth, many of the side quests do not have much bearing on the actual main story. Sure, some side quests in the game will help you gain helpful items and armor, but it does not change the ending or how NPC will react to you. Since Nintendo wanted to take a page from the western rpg genre, decision making should have been impactful to the outcome of the game. POTENTIAL SPOILER--->From what I know there are two endings to the game and I have gotten both by visiting all the specific areas in the game that's part of a side quest.Sixth, does bigger mean better? In the case that there are 120 mini dungeons in the game, they had to make the world bigger to fit them, but in my opinion, making the world so large made things a little tedious. Sure, there is fast travel, but getting to each location seemed a little bit of a chore especially since fighting enemies was not rewarding, and other than finding mini dungeons and moblin bases, there was nothing much to do. I don't consider hunting or gathering foods that much of reason for the large map.In no way am I bashing Zelda. In fact, I do believe it deserves to be the game of the year. Even with what I consider as flaws, the good outweigh the negative greatly. I just hope Nintendo can take some advice from their fans to improve the next installment.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Zelda is great game. I took time off to play the Mario Odyssey right now (Mid-November 2017). I have all the maps unlocked. I have 15 hearts and 2 stamina wheels. I have Master sword. I am not ready to finish the game. I want to explore the shrines quests and stock up some more equipment. I have a house where I store weapons and shield. I am using 20 Amiibos (mostly from Smash Bros 3DS) for extra loots before I fight the final boss. Zelda is fun to play after getting like dozen ancient arrows. All four guardians are freed. I am trying to get the dragon parts for elixirs and leveling up armors with dragon parts and rare loots. I spent over 4 hours on snow ball bowling for coin farming to upgrade the house. I bought the cartridge version of Zelda because I didn't want to download and have some physical media to play on. So far, awesome game play. It's as intense at times vs Xbox One games like Metal Gear Solid to sneak on a large prey (wearing sneak suit). Basically, I bought the Nintendo Switch to play Zelda game.Aside from price of console and accessories like controller and microSD card to increase storage, the games and system performance are highly satisfactory. $300 for console, $60 for average games, $20 for average downloadable titles, $200 for 256 GB microSD card, $70 for pro controller ($140 for 2). $300, $280 for games: Zelda, Splatoon 2, Mario Rabbit, Mario Odyssey, Namco Museum, 1945, $200 microSD card, $140 for 2 pro controllers: grand total so far $920. I purchased the downloadable games using Nintendo Eshop by adding $200 to Eshop credit. Pricing reflects the volume sales. More they sell, cost goes down for consumer electronics. Contents of Mario and Zelda games are highly satisfactory. There was added cost of purchasing Nintendo Amiibo. I bought the Zelda Amiibos in retail and purchased rest of the Nintendo 3DS Smash Bros Amiibos on second hand market using craigslist and Facebook market. Total cost of having more than 20 Amiibos were $300: break down is $125 for Zelda set from a collector, and rest from another second hand seller who sold me in bulk which helps me with Zelda for getting free mushrooms and arrows. It saved me time to collect the mushrooms separately although collecting is pretty easy by just warping to Shrine nearby forest areas and snow fields for gourmet meat for coin farming as well as warping to snow ball bowling. Anyhow, all the titles are family friendly and less violent vs Xbox One S titles. Definitely price does hurt the wallet for Christmas. Aside from that I think it's worth to buy Switch. It's less painful than Wii U to transfer and load games from disc format. Console functions as a portable device as well. However, I forbid my household guests from taking it out of the docking station and only use it with LG 4K 55"" UHD LED television. 6.2 inch vs 55 inch is obvious. 1080p output from Nintendo Switch is seamlessly converted to 4K screen and game play is smooth without loading lag. I prefer using pro controller over joycon. I left the joycon attached the console and bought two pro controllers to play games. Usually, one pro controller is charging while other is being played with. I am using two pro controller for Mario Odyssey 2 Player mode. I am playing the hat. On Mario + Rabbid, we play the 2 player mode on team battles to earn coins for main quest weapons. Smash Brothers Amiibo came in handy for using on Zelda as well as Mario + Rabbid to add weapons and loots. Splatoon 2 allows Amiibos for special weapons and gears. Both instances of Amiibos added extra game play options and gave me satisfactions on investing on 20 Amiibos for overall life time of Switch gaming. I wrote this review after two months of game play on 6 games (4 major titles and 2 downloadable) and several official accessories were tested.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,11,2017,√âtats-Unis

"So now that I pissed off everyone with my title, on with the review.Breath of the Wild surprised me because as the title says, I don't really like Zelda games. They never clicked with me for one reason or another. Which is funny because clones like Darksiders and Beyond Oasis on the Sega Genesis, I love! But I really have been enjoying this game. I really like Twilight Princess, that's the one I can say I enjoyed the most and love. I enjoyed the characters, the growth between Link and Midna, seeing her develop as a character really won me over.I know a lot of people don't like durability because ...they like their games simple and dull, but it really keeps combat interesting in this game. You will be swapping weapons often whether you like it or not, they also function differently with attack values, durability, swing speed and how you can maneuver.This game was obviously inspired by the likes of Skyrim and Farcry, you need to cook to make better healing items and they can even have special effects to resist the weather. It's not complex either and even me who doesn't care for this finds it simple and quick. Get ingredients, find a pot, light a fire, dump in, fud is dun. The Farcry inspiration is...the towers and random dungeons you can find. But they're not as frequent, useless and annoying. They managed to do what Ubisoft did, but make it good. Who knew. Thank you Nintendo for understanding that FUN is priority in a game and not irritating padding. Oh, also fire spreading is a fun mechanic they took and I'd say improved on in many ways. I wouldn't say climbing the towers but the trials offer interesting challenges with good variety to themIt's not perfect, the controls can be a bit finicky with powers and personally I find it hard to maneuver. Also, despite a patch it has some massive framedrops due to its vsyncing. The game runs at 30fps, if there's slowdown it drops to 20 and it's very obvious. Now before you comment saying ""that's not important, wah wah wah"" it's a flaw, low framerates strain my eyes as it is and yes it's not frequent, it's uncommon at best but it's still worth noting. I have very sensitive eyes and frame drops on a small screen I'm focused on does wear on my eyes.The other issue is load times are pretty heavy, they vary from 10-40 seconds depending on the area you are loading into. But even dying, the load time is pretty harsh. While some may argue they know of other games with similar load times, that's not a positive thing. The shining light in this is with standby mode you don't need to load back into the game if you have put the system into sleep mode or hopped out of the game to go to the e-shop or something.Combat is great, maybe the best it's ever been. You can do ztargeting or ...don't, play more like an action game, it does help, especially with some moves being required to ztarget (I think?) but it adds to it. As I said, durability has you switching weapons and using a variety of them to get by and it makes it fun, for me anyway. Weapon about to break? Fling it at the enemy! See a fire? Light your arrow and shoot it at a field of grass, fire!There's random encounters and FINALLY a game with no difficulty/level scaling. Wander into the wrong neck of the woods? You'll find strong ass enemies that will happily punch your face in faster than you can say ""MuscularSheikahAreSexy""Is this game worth playing? Yes. At the time of writing this is the only must have Switch game (the others are either not my thing or they're too expensive), if you have a WiiU and you're not interested in a Switch? Get it on that, ignore the rumors. It runs just as well, the framerate dips happen in different areas and it also may be patched.It runs well and looks great in tablet or TV mode. Again, I am FAR from a die-hard Zelda fan but I do find this game fun and I imagine fans of Zelda may get more mileage out of it than me. Like Skyrim? Zelda? ....Farcry...? You'd probably dig this game.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Don't do it! I warned you... it will suck you in and keep you there...glued to the screen until your controllers run out of battery life! PRO tip for those first using the controllers:  if you have not fully-charged the controllers, you might get an hour or two out of the game, but that's it!I don't know who designed this, and I vaguely remember playing it on the Wii years ago, but not THIS. It's a complete environmental immersion into the fantasy world of Hyrule! The back story is pretty old, but it applies so well in this version. The graphics are outstanding! Gameplay is smooth, even though everything is wireless.What I love most about the game is that you can know absolutely nothing, and the game is built to take you on the journey. If you're an advanced player, you can zip through things easily and still find challenges. I haven't yet played through everything, and there are little hidden goodies all over the maps, new things to discover...on and on and on. YES, even cheating via YouTube videos only helps you so much. You still have to perform the tasks! The Japanese-sourced characters, story, and references are very Wii-oriented, and putting nature above all else feels authentic.For those afraid of heights... well... there are moments when you either have to get over it, or you won't be able to perform certain tasks! So cheat, or not, read up or not, or just let the game take you for a very, very, very long ride through gorgeously-rendered landscapes that interact with you! Discover endless puzzles, adventures, and minor social-interactions with a huge cast of characters.The game is forgiving. If you die... you'll be able to continue from a last saved position. Feel that you might lose in a situation? Save first, go back later! Voila! Compared to some of the other much-more-complicated titles out there, this game is completely forgiving!I'm new to the Switch, so perhaps I'm just overwhelmed, but this game blew away my expectations and got me absolutely hooked!NOTE: Legend of Zelda has always been a single-player game. It's designed around a single person playing a single character. There are some multiplayer options - I have not yet explored them. But this isn't a game you sit and play with a partner. If your wrists or elbows start to hurt, you'll know why! Remember to stretch! :)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"It's true this game is amazing and while playing it I was so impressed by the vision it look to create it. Just the little things like climbing trees for apples, enemies picking up your weapon if you dropped it and attack you with it. To the hauntingly beautiful music and in depth world. Everything they say is true but some things most reviewers leave out. There is a big negative about this game.It reaches for the stars graphics wise. It really does it's best to max out the Switches graphic performance. I respect that but what happens is performance issues at times. Maybe it is because I am a PC gamer by hart but I feel performance issues like this should be a negative. It happens when docked, and when not docked.The Wii U it preforms better. Much better in fact they are pretty cheap right now so it is your best option to play this game in my opinion. But there are still issues there. So yes you could argue a game preforming uneven on console is more the fault of the console but It really is the developers issues.Twilight Princess and the Wind Walker (both masterpieces) never did this. I would argue both those games are better than The Legend of Zelda and were not tied to a system with big question marks. Gamecube is well loved - I know I loved  mine. The Wii I wasn't a fan of but it did what it said out to do no problems like the Switch - was a massive success 100 million sold.My point is Zelda is like Bethesda games, they always get glowing scores despite flaws. You get a feeling that people love these franchises so much they don't care about flaws. Which isn't wrong but it stops them being realistic for everyone else. Also I feel the Switch and Wii U really hold this game back.For instance there was a HD Zelda demo back in 2012 involving the Wii U. It looked amazing and ran at 1080p (I dream of 4k Zelda myself). But with the Switch it really holds back these graphics and art direction. Which is sad because we can all agree 1080p Zelda would be great and 4k would be mind blowing.Look the game is great, just under or just as good as the best Zelda titles of all time. But it isn't without flaws, and isn't my game of the year. But what do I know? I thought Darksouls 3 should have gotten game of the year last year, that Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 deserved consideration. I thought Overwatch was above average - yet it won game of the year everywhere.Pros+ Everything you would come to expect from a Zelda game and then some+ Art direction+ music+ inventory system+ combat mechanics+ loot in the world+ NPCs+ Story+ PuzzlesCons- uneven performance at times- tied to a system with technical flaws and reported issues- tied to an old system no longer supported- very high price point to play one game - maybe better to waitGradeAConclusionI am not saying Zelda isn't amazing that provides in depth, original gameplay, few others games can dream of, I am not even saying it isn't a masterpiece to a degree. My only point is it's a flawed masterpiece where as some older Zelda games don't have those flaws. That isn't an insult my favorite game maybe of all time is Vampire: The Masquerade ‚Äì Bloodlines another flawed masterpiece.I can't imagine any Zelda fan disappointed with this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I went into this thinking I would be on the fence of a return/resale because I hate open world games almost completely.  Truth be told as I know lots of people are going to go crazy into write-ups I'll do this differently.  I will say I was done with Zelda, it was so over done, played out, boring to a fault with so little changed in 30 years only made more glaring and worse in 3D wide open empty spaces like in Twilight Princess that I never finished or came close to.  This game was a game changer for me.While this game is open world, all those issues people tend to have not liking such types of games, Nintendo took a hammer to the wall and broke that.  This game doesn't have that same dragged out truly overwhelming to an annoyance level size to it.  Yet it does have that size.  It's truly open to how you wish to play to the point, even when you clear the end game boss (did this last night) there's still more than 1/2 the game or more you can easily trek around on to do.  There's so much to see, learn, discover, and create (foods), upgrade (great fairies) and more you can kind of choose your own adventure any time you wish to fire it up.  A player could in theory drop this game in an hour if you just ignored the divine beasts and ran the back door for Ganon if you have some perfect timing on shield blocks, but realistically this one is one of those 50-100+(into the 100s easy) type hour game if you wish it.  You set your own size, time, and involvement.For me I did 14 hearts and 2 stamina boosts, got the master sword and went the back door into the castle and got the hylian shield as well.  In those 14 hearts 4 came from the divine beasts.  I played this game without a stop a bare minimum of 2 hours every day since it came out on the 3rd, some days I got as high at 6 probably averaging 4 a day really with it.  In that time I know I only hit around 1/3 of the shrines possible, did no side shrine quests basically, found one spring(there are 3 based upon the triforce parts) but didn't do the task, found/did 1 of the optional labyrinths, activated all the towers.To Nintendo: If/when you make a sequel on the Switch as you now have a years in development engine to use now I request you stick with this formula.  I was so spent on the old huge annoying dungeon and wide open empty spaces of 3D Zelda before this (Wind Waker aside) I was finished.  Making the quest itself from the 'area' to get the key item to fight the divine beast, then to do the puzzle beast interior and the ultimate boss on each that was a fantastic new approach to dungeon design I want to see continued.  This game is such a refreshing improvement on the franchise it has won me back over again.  Please do not go back to the old style, or even partly so like LBTW(3DS) as I couldn't stand that one either.  This works, it works so well I can happily return and keep investigating new areas or I can go back in and beat down Ganon at will once more when I get the last few memories.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Beautiful graphics, seamless gameplay, unique and wonderful story, heart-moving score and theme music; the crown jewel of the Legend of Zelda collection! Anyone who loves Zelda games has probably already played this, but I must go on record to say this is the best Zelda game out there (so far). Every detail is accounted for, as the creators of the game rewrote it as they played it themselves. There‚Äôs a real love and passion for this game, and it feels painstakingly made. There‚Äôs a unique sense of freedom you get while playing it, so much that I dream about being Link in the wilderness of Hyrule.I can‚Äôt say a bad thing about this game, I couldn‚Äôt recommend it more, and I can‚Äôt wait for the sequel!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,8,2022,√âtats-Unis
"To be blunt, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is arguably the best Zelda game ever made and it's definitely the most ambitious. Nintendo has outdone themselves, you have to hand it to them. There is very little negative to say about this game. Let's do a break down of the pros and cons.Pros:+Best Zelda story to date. Yes, it may be the same premise, but there is much more depth this time around. There are other things going on, not just Link rescuing Zelda. All of the side quests add so much to the main story. The depth is what makes the game succeed.+Voice acting adds a lot to some of the characters we already know and love, including Zelda herself. It makes for a richer and more interesting story.+Gameplay is king in Zelda games. We all know this. BOTW is no different. There is a ton of gameplay variety, more than there has ever been. Everything from fighting, exploring, cooking, transportation, it's all been either improved or newly introduced.+Open World and Exploration are front and center in BOTW. The open world design allows you take whatever path you choose. While most Zelda games in the past were linear, this is not the same. Whatever approach you prefer is completely fine. The freedom really shines through in BOTW.+The beautiful art style makes up for anything lacking in the graphics department. The Wii U and Switch are not on par with the PS4 and Xbox One, so don't expect that type of beauty, but the art style truly does make a big difference. Nintendo has always been king when it comes to gorgeous art and design. Exploration is one of the game's biggest draws. Conquering the 100+ shrines is amazing!+Wii U and Switch versions offer choice for the gamer. You don't have to upgrade to the Switch to experience BOTW. The Wii U version is every bit as great as the Switch one. In fact, I owned the Switch version but got rid of it in favor of the Wii U version. I did not see the point in upgrading since the only other Switch game I care about is Mario Odyssey and that doesn't come out for almost another year.+More than 100 hours of gameplay offers major value (in your wallet) and replay value. There is always something to see and do!+The game world is absolutely huge. This lends itself to many hours of fun, whether you are doing side quests, the main quests, shrines, or goofing off.+Challenging and thought provoking puzzles are a standout in BOTW. Every shrine has a challenging puzzle, while most boss battles require you to solve a puzzle as well.+Cooking is really fun. Doing recipes is a blast, just experimenting with food can be an interesting distraction.+Great A.I., from the main characters, townsfolk and enemies.+Use the Wii U Pro controller for the best experience. It is more tight and comfortable than the GamePad. I don't have experience with the Switch Pro Controller (probably because it's $70!) but I am sure it's superior to the Joy-Cons and Grip.Cons:-Weapons break a lot, maybe too much. I found that a lot of my time was devoted to changing weapons, whether in a battle or not. It's not a game-breaker but it is an annoyance.Overall, Zelda BOTW is an all time great. It's a game you must experience and have in your collection. I bought the Wii U version, but the choice is yours. Go out and buy it to experience something you will never forget!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Game of the year!!! Congrats Nintendo!Very beautiful game.I didn't want it to end. After 100 hours I decided to beat Ganon. I completed 112 shrines, collected over 200 korok seeds and completed many quests. I decided to start a new game and it still feels like a new experience. I find myself going straight to my favorite parts of the game and it is still amazing that there is no mandatory order or path to keep going.I feel like over the years everyone has been spoiled with better graphics and gameplay. The most complaints I heard about the game was frame rate/lag issues, especially around multiple monsters or non-playable characters. But that means nothing to me. I experienced it a few times but it did not drop the game rating from 5 stars.I love the scenery. No matter where you are there is always something beautiful to look at. The landscapes are gorgeous and I love the way everything shines when it rains. Catching wild horses is also fun. I swear I have caught over 40 or 50 horses.It doesn't matter what you get into in the game. There are always tricks to getting more of what you want. Take a picture of whatever you want to find, vegetables, stones, ingredients, tools, weapons, anything really, and your Sheika slate (tablet that Link uses in the game) will help guide you to find more. I'm always looking for precious metals/stones and it is the easiest way to get 10 thousand rupees or more. However much you need or want.There are so many quests and challenges. Puzzles that require you to find different characters to get hints or answers. Or to help you find a location of something. Everyone has their own likes and opinions, but to me, Breath of the Wild has no frustrating tasks or quests. I have enjoyed every bit of the game. I loved, loved, loved Breath of the Wild.The first Zelda game I played was on the Gameboy, Oracle of Seasons. I thought it was fun and great. Especially for its time and portability. I did not consider myself a big Zelda fan until Twilight Princess, though. I own the Wii version and the HD version for the Wii U. I think it will always be my favorite. It is hard to beat a game that allows you to turn into a wolf! I was very excited when I found out that you could bring wolf Link into Breath of the Wild and even use Epona. I use both of them all the time. I'm also very excited about the upcoming DLCs and new story to come. UPDATE: They are here! Very good so far! Good back stories.Recently, I have started playing Ocarina of Time on my 3DS. It is hard to get used to the controls, the smaller screen, and lower graphics but I have heard from so many of my friends that it is one of the best Zelda games ever made. It is hard to compare Breath of the Wild to Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword because you do not have all of the freedom to roam around wherever you want. Breath of the Wild IS freedom. Skyward Sword did give you the option to fly anywhere above the clouds and the worlds were very big but it still does not come close to Breath of the Wild. I haven't played Wind Waker, Majora's Mask or other remakes and older entries of the series but I will eventually.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Say goodbye to your social life after playing this I didn‚Äôt realize how immersed I was into this game. Graphics, gameplay and story are top notch and something you‚Äôd expect from a  Zelda title. Open world Zelda is a game changer and I am 70 hrs into the game and have yet to scratch the surface of what this game has yet to offer. I‚Äôm so addicted to just cooking and collecting random things, toull never get bored playing this game because there‚Äôs so much to do. The main theme of this game is exploration and you‚Äôll be enjoying the scenery for hours on end. In the beginning it was really hard because you‚Äôre literally naked with no accessories and weapons but as you level up you gain more freedom and power and it gets so much better as you progress in the game. I just wish the music was a bit better, and adding some heroic themes and such but that only comes when you go beat Ganon in hurtle castle and the musical score finally starts to play.

"Antes que otra cosa el juego lo adquir√≠ durante el Buen Fin por lo que lo adquir√≠ con un descuento adicional, pero debido a lo mismo al momento de hacer la compra Amazon dec√≠a que estar√≠a disponible aproximadamente en 4 d√≠as y todav√≠a tendr√≠a que esperar otros 3-5 para recibirlo a√∫n siendo usuario Prime, para mi sorpresa lo adquir√≠ el d√≠a Lunes 20 para el Viernes 24 ya ten√≠a el juego en mis manos antes de las 10am por lo que debo aplaudir al servicio de Amazon ante todo por el servicio y la r√°pidez ante la gran cantidad de entregas que ten√≠an debido a la fecha (eso me coment√≥ el repartidor).Ahora en cuanto al juego el √∫ltimo Zelda que jugu√© fue Spirit Tracks para DS y el √∫ltimo de consola casera fue Wind Waker, lo cual dice que no he tocado un juego de Zelda ya en varios a√±os, cu√°ndo sali√≥ el juego no le di importancia pues no estaba en mi inter√©s tenerlo y tampoco comprar un Nintendo Switch en ese momento, vi rese√±as y lo aclamaban pens√© eran exageraciones pero no le d√≠ importancia. Al adquirir mi consola de entre los juegos disponibles opt√© por Zelda debido a esas rese√±as quer√≠a ver que tan ciertas eran y a que ser√≠a el que me tardar√≠a m√°s en terminar , y debo decir que me encanta no me arrepiendo de haberlo comprado, es un excelente juego, en lo personal no me gustan los juegos open world no me gusta tener que andar corriendo por todos lados, prefiero algo linear, pero he jugado algunos y los pocos que he jugado de este tipo me han encantado y Zelda no es la excepci√≥n es de esos juegos que dices, s√≥lo 5 minutos m√°s y cu√°ndo te das cuenta ya pasaron 2 horas y te desvelas sin darte cuenta. No pienso aburrir con una rese√±a m√°s ya que en internet y aqu√≠ puedes encontrar varias, pero si puedo decir que el juego es excelente, muy amplio tanto en lo que puedes hacer y puedes conseguir, si te gusta explorar y eres de los que hace todo le saca todo el jugo a sus juegos, este juego es ideal para ti, incluso si no te gusta como a mi, el dise√±o, ambiente y gameplay te atrapa y puedes jugar s√≥lo lo principal e irte r√°pido y a√∫n as√≠ tienes un muy buen juego que te durar√° bastante. No es el mejor juego de la historia, no soy fanboy de Nintendo pero si es de los mejores juegos del a√±o o el mejor, muy dif√≠cil encontrar algo tan bien hecho como este juego.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,12,2017,Mexique
"If I'm not playing it, I'm thinking of playing it. It's vast, detailed (to me, anyhow- I never played Witcher or Skyrim or anything like that for over a couple minutes) and looks great. I've seen no slowdown in handheld or console mode, and have gotten all the play time I've needed (so, apparently less than 2 or 3 hours at a session) between dockings.I love having so much exploration and experimentation to do, and to be able to just take it with me wherever, sneak in what play time I may, and then put it to sleep or resume in a second. But that's more the Switch in general than this game particularly.The game is a good fit to the console, I think. And it's easily the best-looking handheld title I've ever played, without feeling like a handheld game.It takes a little bit to learn, but you do acquire basically all the skills you need to solve every puzzle in the game after the first 4 shrines- the rest is a question of searching, surviving, and creative solutions.Everywhere in this game there's SOMEthing to do or see, large or small, and frequently more than one thing. I expect to be playing and enjoying this for a very long time, based on my time so far.You're probably tired of hearing it's a must-buy, yes? It's magic, it cured my bald spot, it makes you delicious breakfast, walks the dog, reads your mind, and so on.Well, yes. It's great. There's a part at the start where you may need to get used to the controls and mechanics, but they're mostly explained- thank goodness the old man at the start says more than just ""It's dangerous to go alone, take this."" But you'd swear he's a relative of that guy.Anyhow... if you have a Switch and don't have this game, it's a worthy purchase. The game card version is 1-2 seconds slower to load areas than internal memory or microSD, I've heard, but it hasn't been a problem for me.If you like exploring, Zelda, and small-ish physics and skill-based puzzles (in the form of shrines), give it a try. You may find yourself addicted.Tips: Don't get too attached to your weapons. Even the best ones, you'll find something just as good in a day or so most likely. Cooking is done by choosing materials from inventory, selecting Hold and then dumping them in a cookpot if you find one- that's one thing that isn't explained by the old man, and it WILL be useful to know for many reasons. And listen to what that old guy at the start says- he gives good advice. Lastly, and this is what makes the game enjoyable for me: if you see something cool in the distance, go there. Detours from the main quest can very easily lead you somewhere just as fun, and if you don't like an area for some reason, you can just head for the horizon and explore elsewhere, coming back when you're feeling up to it, or even not coming back at all.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Having learned from their mistakes with Skyward Sword (excessive handholding, pacing, linear/tired gameplay), Nintendo decided to bring their next 3D Zelda game into the open world. You can do as little or as much as you want. It‚Äôs your world.The Good Stuff:Gameplay. This is the best 3D Zelda game to date. I got the itch to replay Twilight Princess HD and realized you can never go back.The graphics. Breath of the Wild looks great on the Switch and feels like a truer sequel to Xenoblade Chronicles for the Wii/3DS than Xenoblade Chronicles X on the Wii U (Which is an awful game). While the Wii U version suffers from low framerate during many parts (even after the patch), the Switch version doesn't seem to have any issues.Music. Since this game is all about atmosphere, Nintendo decided to go with a softer, more subtle background music for most of the game. There is also various music for different areas, but not as catchy as previous Zelda games.No handholding. The game doesn't treat you like you've never played a video game before. While there is a ""tutorial"" section at the start, it feels very natural.Voice Acting. This is the first Zelda game to feature voice acting but it's used lightly. You're still going to click through tons of text adjoined by grunts and groans.The Bad Stuff:Tediousness. You will be finding/hunting food and other items. You must cook your food to make hearts and elixirs using recipes. It‚Äôs all trial and error. You will have to constantly find new weapons, shields, and bows as they all break. You will need to upgrade slots to hold more of these items. Lastly, you must increase your hearts AND stamina. Menus and item selection are all over the place and very confusing to use. You can access a weapons menu 2 different ways, but only one allows you to drop them. Why not both? They really needed to work more on this.Controls. Those tiny joycons simply don't cut it as a handheld controller. I'm constantly accidently pushing on the control stick when trying to move around the camera during a battle (causing me to zoom in instead). The position of the right stick is also not very ideal. I finally got a Pro Controller and everything is much better.Voices. Obviously adding voices to a Zelda game is going to be controversial. Zelda Cdi anyone? While Link doesn't talk for some reason, almost everyone is well voiced except for Mipha (Zora Princess). She's awful. Luckily, the others aren't so bad. A lot of people complain about Zelda, but I find her to be acceptable.Overall, if you're a Zelda fan there is a whole world to discover and enjoy. You can spend 60+ hours playing around and still not even start the main storyline. Or, you can just jump right into the story and finish it as quickly as you choose. The game is completely open and allows you to play it however you see fit.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Breath of the Wild is one of those games console companies will make in order to sell their consoles, rather than to primarily turn a profit from the sales (although this one certainly is profitable in its own right)This means that it received a bit more love than your usual title and it shows. I'n my ~300 hours of playing (im still on my second play-through, this time on master mode) I am still finding new things to see and explore. It is the kind of game where you can just pick a direction and suddenly stumble upon something new and/or exciting with lots of side content.Initially I was not a fan of the weapon durability system but the game gives you so many new and cool weapons all the time (even in the endgame) that this mechanic more-so encourages you to try out more weapon types to keep the loop exciting. (you get enough that if you absolutely cannot stand one or two weapon types, you almost never need to use them)If an open world game where the world actually feels spread out and full of diverse content, you cannot go wrong here; there is a reason so many other games are trying to copy it now.That being said, I do wish it had more true dungeons. There are five in total and they all look and feel the same, save for Hyrule castle and will wear off extremely quickly.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2022,√âtats-Unis

"Okay, so this is likely the best open world game ever made, at least at the time of release.The world is massive, and if you like to explore, you can easily get a couple hundred hours out of the game.I don‚Äôt like to explore all that much, so I didn‚Äôt really do so. I played for 65 hours, beat the game and the dlc and only completed 21% of the game. That‚Äôs how massive it is. Heck, I never even went to half of the areas in the game that you can go to.Gone are the items and temples from every other Zelda game. Here you get a smartphone thing that gives you a handful of skills to help solve puzzles. There are no more temples, replaced by 120 shrines, which are basically mini temples. They‚Äôre clever and fun for the most part, and many require puzzle solving to even open them.Instead of a couple swords and shields, you can pick up anything an enemy uses, but they‚Äôll all break eventually.I personally prefer the old style Zelda to all this, but it‚Äôs pretty good. My biggest complaint comes from climbing, which is what you will spend half the game doing. You get limited stamina, so you have to plan your climbs. This would be fine in small doses, but as I said, you climb a lot, and it‚Äôs slow and tedious. What makes it worse is when it rains, the ledges become slippery and you‚Äôll slide down constantly, making it almost impossible to climb some ledges. This would be okay if it didn‚Äôt rain half the game. So something not fun just becomes even more not fun.As for the difficulty, this is like the hardest Zelda since Zelda 2 on NES. This is one of those games that starts out really hard and gets easier the further you get. Until you get more hearts, many enemies can one-shot or else take you down very quickly. So be warned about that.Overall, I find the game to be okay. It‚Äôs got some really great mechanics, but I found myself more annoyed then anything while playing.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,5,2022,√âtats-Unis

"In general, one of the most amazing games I've ever played. This game has set the bar for action-RPG combat mechanics. I'm so tired of games that rely on dice-rolling or lazy hardcoded animations in combat (MMORPGs, I'm looking at you), leaving it feeling unconvincing. Zelda's heavy use of physics and clever animation made the stick/axe/sword/whatever register with the enemies perfectly. You feel every single hit, and it's so damn satisfying.If I listed everything great about this game, they would far outnumber my cons below.If Nintendo decides to make another massive Zelda title like this again, I do have some hopes and wishes for it, where I felt like this one fell a little short in some ways, despite being so good anyway:‚Äî As a Zelda game, it felt like quite a few things were missing, but I also get that they're trying to break conventions a bit.‚Äî There could have been more variety in enemies. There was heavy reuse of the base enemy types for each biome, but I would have liked to see more unique enemies for each area, as in the temples and areas in past Zelda titles.‚Äî Overall, the world felt pretty empty, despite having stables and a few small towns.‚Äî Breaking weapons kept things constantly fresh, but having more permanent weapons as a major reward for completing the Divine Beast temples or shrines would have been really nice for progression. Much like the Master Sword gives a bonus for certain enemy types, more weapons like this could have existed to give bonuses in certain regions or climates. This idea could pair really well with more unique enemies and having to find the optimal approach to defeating them.‚Äî While the boomerangs were amazing and challenging to use, they were way too easy to lose if they weren't breaking too. I always hesitated to use them because there was such a high chance of it hitting a ledge and falling down a cliff to be lost forever.‚Äî Overall, while this game had an alright story, the wonder and mystery of walking into places like The Forest, Shadow, and Spirit temples from Ocarina of Time was totally missing for me in this game. Zelda has always been a game where its outlandish environments and temples really set the tone for where you were at in the game. Breath of the Wild remained pretty neutral feeling for most of the game.‚Äî I was really disappointed when I found that Korok Forest was a small little area after passing The Lost Woods. I wish they had considered making it and the surrounding area explorable. The whole idea of the Lost Woods is getting lost, yes, but as a lover of forests in RPG games, I really wanted it to be as big as it looked on the map.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Breath of the Wild is... okay. I know that's an unpopular opinion but honestly anytime you review a mainline Nintendo game as anything less than the Second Coming you're going to get downvoted.Legend of Zelda: Assassin's Creed. So much of Breath of the Wild is cribbed from other open world games. You climb towers to reveal the map. Areas of the map are off-limits until you pass certain story or equipment requirements. If you just add in the ""hay dive"" the core mechanics would look a whole lot like other games.Legend of Strategy Guides. An early quest says climb a tower and identify several places to go next. I do so. I head out toward those points and... I die. I jumped off the no-go zone because I assumed this was the game telling me where to go. So I climb the tower again and look for the ""correct"" places to go, which are literally the same type of places as I scouted before. I was just looking at the ""wrong"" ones... even though they're literally identical so in the early game I have absolutely no way to tell the difference. I have to open my map AFTER I mark a point, verify that it's one of the ""right"" ones, then head off toward the ""correct"" next destination. I die again. It turns out most of these early-game points require cold weather clothing. Climate hasn't been thoroughly explained yet in the game. There are no shops. You can't eat regular food items to restore health when you're cold. So umm... what do I do? I'm barely an hour in, and I have to look up a guide for where the cold-weather clothing is. That's bad. Cold-weather clothing seems to only be available in one cabin, which has nothing to stand out on the map, behind a quest that has next to zero explanation on how to complete it. Not good.Legend of Teleporting Old Men. Nintendo wanted a deserted feel to this part of the world, but they couldn't figure out how to explain mechanics to the player without their usual NPCs. So there's one teleporting old man to stand in for the array of shopkeeps and tutorials a game would normally have. I see through you, Nintendo. When you add up all the places where the old man appears to help you, there are dozens of people living and working in the first area of the game. It isn't really deserted. The people are just hidden behind an invisible wall that makes them all look like the same old man. I don't like that design choice, even if I understand why it was done.Legend of Deserted World Maps. A lot of Breath of the Wild is open space. I totally understand that you're supposed to be drinking in the scenery, the music, the ambiance. But I just got screwed up because the game places several copies of objective markets right in front of you and punished you if you go to the ""wrong"" ones. So now I have several cases where I regret all the backtracking and wasted time I've spent trying to track down the next objective - and I'm still in what amounts to the tutorial. That's not a good sign.I get where Breath of the Wild is going. I appreciate Nintendo tried something ""new"" for a Zelda game. But slapping a Zelda label on a new Assassin's Creed game is not nearly as interesting or groundbreaking as people want to think it is. It's a clever ploy, it sucked in a lot of people, but it doesn't work on me.There are other little things poking at me already. Weapons break too fast, and there's a limited inventory, so early game I feel like I'm throwing a kitchen sink at every enemy. The moment I got unlimited bombs, I quit using my regular weapons entirely whenever I could. It would have been a much better choice, in my opinion, to have a longer life on these weapons so that you're not wasting time and energy managing them early game. You're supposed to be exploring and enjoying the world, not moping because a stick broke. I think they patched some of the late-game problems here, where even very rare weapons broke too quickly so you kept throwing garbage at enemies to preserve your good weapons, but it's still a silly problem to have. I'd prefer the opposite - what if your beginning stick levels up, so you always want to keep it by your side? It could be your companion in the Wild. I think that makes a lot more sense, and then you'd really have to agonize about inventory space.So this game doesn't click for me. I'll play it, just like I play any Assassin's Creed game once in a while. But at least in the early game I'm not excited by anything.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"There are tons of reviews already, but this game is *so great* that I felt the need to go out of my way to add another 5-star review.Some previous Zelda games (such as Windwaker and Ocarina of Time) are rightly listed as some of the best video games of all time.  Breath of the Wild just may outdo them all, or at the very least, it has earned an honored place beside them.This is the very definition of a killer app:  an application *so great* that it is worth buying the entire platform.  Even if there is never another great game on Switch ever again (and there definitely will be with Mario Odyssey), it was entirely worth it.  I say this even though we already had a Wii U so I wasn't forced to upgrade.The world of BotW is enormous, beautiful, and the right amount of dangerous.  Even if I'm not pursuing a specific quest, it's exhilarating just to head off into new terrain and explore.  Scale a tricky mountain -- then paraglide off it into parts unknown -- then land in a field of wild horses -- then capture and befriend one -- then dart off across the landscape at high speed past enormous monsters into further adventures.  Wow.  And of course, there are tons of main quests, side quests, and shrines to explore, each of which gives you a tiny advantage that makes things a bit easier and a bit more fun going forward.  For example, you might gain just a little more hit points (hearts), or a little more stamina (to help run further or climb higher obstacles), or you might run across a piece of gear that lets you swim up waterfalls (so cool).  And then there was the time when I was suddenly surrounded by monsters riding bears, and I was tempted to warp out to safety, when I managed to knock one off his mount -- and realized I could jump on the bear myself and tame him.  I rode him around a bit but they wouldn't accept him at the stables.  :^)Tons more I could say, but the last thing I'll say for now is that this is a great game to play either alone or with friends or grade-school-age kids.  We tend to play all together, and sometimes, one of the kids will sneak the Switch to their rooms to play by themselves.  (One likes to cook and tame wild horses, the other likes to roam and smash monsters.  I like to find all the secrets and beat all the puzzles.)  We're well over 200 hours at this point, and could have easily beat the final battle long ago, and still loving it.  (Just 1 shrine left!)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"i bought this game in 2018 or thereabouts when i was working about a 55-hour work week and was exhausted all the time. i needed something fun and light to do in my spare time.i quickly realized this game was not what i was looking for. hundreds of shrines dot the landscape and are the main means of powering up and advancing through the game. Some of them are easy but some are very challenging puzzles and can take 45 minutes or more. When I only had an hour or two of free time, this was very frustrating and did not give me the relaxation and recreation that i desperately needed.your character is extremely weak in the beginning and as a new, unskilled player, you die a lot. you have to do a lot of things like cook and craft meals. weapons are CONSTANTLY breaking on you and you have to get new ones. and the puzzles, which have always been a hallmark of zelda games, are genuinely challenging and can be frustrating.bottom line the game was not providing the relaxation i desperately needed in my very stressed out life at the time, and i sold it.however, in 2020 quarantine, with far too much downtime for my own good, and a lot less stress in my life.... this game has proved to be a godsend. when one has adequate time to invest in the game and can appreciate it, it is truly a marvel and a sight to behold. i would put it right up there as one of the best games i have ever played.its not a good game for someone who doesnt have a lot of free time, as it really doesnt work in small doses. you need to have a lot of time to dedicate to it. and in 2020, with not a ton else to do, it's become a godsend.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I bought this game because it was discounted at the time of purchase & got it delivered a day later with standard free shipping. I've never played a LOZ game ever and had no expectations before jumping in. Here are my personal opinions about the game and my thoughts in my initial playthrough:TL;DR: Good game, recommend especially when discounted.Pros:1) Pretty big open world. Lots to explore.2) Not much handholding. (Just enough to get the basics in) A lot of situations in this game have multiple solutions so it encourages trial & error/outside of the box thinking.3) Kid-friendly but also enjoyable for adults/parents4) Neat details/mechanics that makes the world more alive (ex: weather, npc day & night cycles)Meh:1) No bulk cooking/potion making option. It's fun to experiment but after a while, it gets tedious when you're trying to make multiple items.2) Weapon durability. The majority of wieldable weapons have a set amount of usage until it breaks. This isn't too much of a problem since more can be found via exploration.3) The story. Please note that I haven't finished the game yet but the story is nothing to write home about. The voice acting quality is nice but the substance of the actual story is just okay. It's not groundbreaking but at least it makes sense.Cons:1) The price. This game is ~5 years old and it's still almost costing the same as when it first launched. Typical Nintendo flagship games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,10,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Teflon suit - checkAll systems optimal - checkOkSo - here.This game is amazing. Not in the sense that it's good. It's amazing in the sense that it best lets you dive into a strange world where you have to wait for months or pay a premium for a device that is technologically a couple of generations back, to do two things: play this game, which has amazing graphics (if your newest console at home is a PS2), and is insanely entertaining to play (if the last thing you bought was Vice City).You will also have to cough for Mario Kart (fill in the needed adjectives to match the correct version title - Super, Hyper), which will amaze you with its drifting and rich universe (if you're a Sega Rallye Championship + Sonic the Hedgehog for Sega Saturn fan, like I am).This thing is PROGRESS in motion - the final nail in the coffin of minecraftization of today's gaming universe, where good (or so) hardware will be put to the task to generate boxy landscapes and characters.Still, this will will be a wonderful adventure in your inner self: you will deal with the different stages of becoming a Nintendo surrogate following the classic five stages of grief:- Denial: Why on earth would your smart seven year old need this ?- Anger: Wasn't the Switch supposed to cost $299 ? Why is it out of stock everywhere, and scalper's paradise where available ?- Bargaining: Ok. Be strong. It will go down in price. Before the birthday. You have time. Plenty. Sorta.- Depression: No, it won't. No, you don't. No time. At all.- Acceptance: Yes, I will wait in line in front of Best Buy. Or Walmart. Or something. Wait. You're a New Yorker. There's no Walmarts in NYC. But wait. There's a Nintendo Store. Yeayyy...What about the game, you'll ask ?Who cares ?!? Your kid will like it. You will in the beginning shiver at the concept that the concept of ""rich game world"" can make more noise than any version of GTA, will cry at the idea that in a time when ""Unravel"" is a few years old such graphics can still exist, but it will go away.

Overall, anyone can pick up this game and play it as a stand alone without having played any of the other  Zelda games.While the story line progressed a little faster than your level could keep up (not exactly a leveling system but measured by how many hearts and amount of stamina you have) it was fairly streamlined. You just have to do a bit of grinding to find shrines and obtain orbs to get additional hearts or stamina in between each story piece. You also had to have 4 orbs to to trade for 1 heart or a quarter of stamina.As an RPG one thing I enjoyed was hunting down and finding the different clothing and armor items for Link to wear. With the addition of changing the coloring, I was able to find a look for Link that I liked, making him somewhat unique to me.The major downside to the game was the weapons. Every weapon had a limited number of uses to them. You could find a great sword or bow or spear that had great power. Unfortunately, after a few uses, *poof* it was gone! This left you scrambling to find as many weapons as you could. However, unless you collected enough Korok Seeds to trade to a creature and get more storage space, you would be very limited in the number of weapons and shields you could carry. Best strategy to combat this - download a map of all shrine and Korok Seed locations. You can place stamps all over the map of item locations. As you are working on clearing through an area or moving on to the next story point, mark the map of where the shrines and Korok Seeds are located and gather those as you go. This way you can trade these as you go along and quickly increase your hearts, stamina, and weapons cache, giving you a bit of an edge.Overall, it was a great game! With better weapon mechanics, I would have given this game a 5 Star review. I finally finished the story last week and I bought it in January (I don't get to play as much as I would like).",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,10,2018,√âtats-Unis

"Excellent Pre-Order service as usual. There are not enough words to describe Breath of the Wild but I will try lol. First thing you notice it the new graphics for the Zelda Franchise. It looks like your playing your way through a painting which is truly a work of art. You are literally thrown out there to play with a storyline starting right from the get go. Your first quest is to kill Ganon. You can go straight to him and give that shot. Good luck to ya. Not gonna happen. Now if you play the game right and follow your waypoint on the map for the fisrt while you will learn exactly what you need to learn to get you through the rest of the game. Before you know it you will have quests stacked up in your que like you were playing World of Warcraft. Its not online but it sure seems like the World is big enough to be an MMORPG. It does feel lonely out there sometimes without some friends playing beside you. The quests are excellent in Breath of the Wild. You can Choose whatever you want to do anytime you want to do it. I hear complaints that people felt they were doing the same thing over and over again. Well thats how they were playing. They were going around finishing the Shrines which are little dungeons which you solve puzzles in. Its very important to knock these shrines off but you can break away and just do quests if you like. Or you can collect items for cooking or go looking to catch a horse so you dont have to hoof it everywhere in this huge world. I never felt the world was empty as every way I have gone there was always something to do. You come up on these little camps, which if cleared will result in opening a chest. Battles at first seemed very hard but once I got the hang of it I started clearing camps in no time. To me the game is the perfect open world action RPG. I highly recommend Breath of the Wild to any RPG fan out there. If you play like I do and do all the side quests and try to find all its secrets with p,aying along the storyline you can expect to play at least 100 hours. Speed runners are already beating the game in about an hour but I say Bah! to that",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Fantastic Game but not quite as good the reviews it's getting. I really enjoyed this game a lot.  I've been playing Zelda games from the very first one and this is in the top 3 without question.  But I can't give it 5 stars.  Why?It doesn't follow the traditional game-play of Zelda.  In BOTW, the entire world is open to you early on in the game.  You can go anyplace you want.  My problem with it is that I think they took it a bit too far with that concept. I really missed having to search for large hidden dungeons, full of numerous enemies, in which you found special tools and items needed to progress further in the world.  I feel that the open world concept is probably more enticing to newer players of the series but it disregards a very important part of what makes a Zelda game.The durability system annoys me.  You should be allowed to use your weapons more than 10 times before breaking, unless it's a tree branch.  Repairing equipment should have been a feature.Low variation of enemies.  I will say that the enemies in the game are great.  The AI is very good but there just isn't enough of them.Controls are a bit strange and not intuitive.  It took me hours before I could finally battle without hitting the wrong button or switch weapons correctly.  I'm so glad there is an option to change the jump and run button because that would have been a huge problem for me.Lack of a soundtrack!  Wheres my classic Zelda songs?  Sometimes you hear faint songs that you recognize but for the most part it's very quiet.  You will just walking  then you will hear like 3 notes on a piano...dun dun duuuuun!...and that's it.  There should have been full soundtrack in this game.Minor performance issues.  Frame rate is good for the most part but it does suffer in some areas of the world.  Kind of disappointing for a new system release.I really loved everything else about the game including the silent protagonist!  The cooking concept was excellent, physics of the game, overall world design, weather, lighting, NPC interactions, pretty much everything else is 5 stars.  I feel like graphically the world and environment was perfection but the game play and mechanics were not.BOTW is certainly the most beautiful Zelda game to date and includes many new concepts and features but falls short of the title of ""Masterpiece"". It may be the game of the year, but it's not the best game in the series.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Writing this review after playing this for almost 100 + hours in 2 months of time, and coming from a first time nintendo console owner, this should mean somethingWhen a friend suggested to try this game which alone is worth buying the console for, i couldnt fathom what he meant. but eventually, switch lite came which fit my requirements of a handheld and a purchase was made. and almost religiously, zelda was bought.Now this game is like nothing you have ever played, because it never tells you what you need to do. apart from a tutorial which is a island (it doesnt even tell you it is a tutorial, it just lets you find the way). it just asks 1 question - Are you curious to know why?almost every aspect of the game which you will find out will be simply an answer to this question. if you keep getting killed (and you will keep getting killed, and it will make you want to break things, A LOT!) and even then it wont tell you what you are doing wrong. because there isnt a single correct way of doing things, there are multiple. and everytime you find out a way, the joy it brings at having found a unique way is so so good that it will propel you to go further.lso this doesnt have a linear story line. this is how an open world game should be. where story will follow you. it keeps building where you go. imagine, they dont even mark cities on a map; it is for you to find, this was so new and frustrating for me that it took me an entire month to find my first city because i had no idea what is the point of this game, what should i be doing. even after completing around 80-85 hours there was still a city which i couldnt find and took me a lot of jumping around, poking things, blowing stuff. IT IS AMAZINGevery game review out there has given it a 10 out of 10 rating and it is absolutely justified. do yourself a favor, buy a switch lite and play this so 10-15 years down from now, you have a great story to tell your next generation",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,7,2020,Inde

"This comes from a super duper Zelda fan. I like this game a lot. In fact, I'd go ahead and say Like+, but not love. I've played every Zelda game so far, and while I haven't finished this one yet, know it won't be my favorite. If this was in percentages, I'd give it 85%.It's INCREDIBLY different from all previous games in the series, and that isn't a bad thing. It's good that they took risks instead of making the same game again. Rather than collecting hearts or cutting down bushes to find arrows, you have to cook your own food and purchase arrows. The cooking was originally off putting but I found it fun after a short amount of time. The enemies come back stronger, there's different ways to fight, and there's many weapons to choose from which allows for a more personalized play style. Overall it's quite a bit of fun. If I sit down to play for an hour I'll typically play for 2-4, so that in itself says it's rather compelling...when I actually start playing it.Without giving away anything, you spend a large portion of the game searching for memories and can go in any order. It's fun for awhile, but so easy to get distracted that I never really feel compelled to play again. I can say ""I'm going to Death Mountain"" and then get distracted for 15 hours. So yes, there's tons to do, but I prefer a game that I'm excited to play because I know something interesting is going to happen instead of climbing cliffs for 5 hours. Which in itself is fun, but it takes away from the plot by leaving large amounts of time in between events. Weapons breaking is REALLY annoying. And don't get me started on the rain. Think you're gonna climb a cliff? No, it's going to start raining when you're halfway up and then you have to pick your nose and check your cell phone for 7 minutes while you wait for the rain to end. And the shrines are fun...until you get bored with them. And then there's more.So it is a great game, but overall not as compelling as many of the others. I love the concept and the plot as well as much of the combat and the cooking, but it takes so long to connect the dots and is so easy to get distracted that I don't find it as enjoyable as some of the other games. I find myself much less emotionally involved.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
Best game on the Switch by far!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,10,2022,√âtats-Unis
"I am going to be honest, I have never played a Legend of Zelda game before I played Breath of the Wild. I am really big into open world games and I recommend this game because it has one of the best environments in a video game I have ever witnessed. The difference between this game and other open world games is that most open world games push you to follow a linear storyline for you to progress, but not so much in Breath of the Wild. I thought I would beat the game in a few hours just like most other games. But this game keeps bringing me back wether it is the music, graphics, or the characters you interact with.I will admit that this game can be difficult at times with bosses and regular enemies you will encounter in your journey, but when you figure out how to take them down you get an amazing feeling of accomplishment. Zelda breath of the wild is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played and if you disagree with me we must fight 1 on 1 behind the wendy's restaurant at 7pm.All jokes aside, i don't give any game a high review but this game just had everything that made me feel like a kid again, everyday I go to work I am watching the clock till I can go home and play botw. Have a great time wether you get this game or not.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
"This is not only a fantastic game in its own right, it's also a great evolution of the Zelda series. And having it available on a portable console like the Switch is amazing. The game world is gigantic, but has also been finely tuned so there are always new things to discover in almost every area as you gain new abilities. The lack of hand-holding makes you feel like you're discovering new things all the time as you experiment and explore. And it's great that there are often multiple ways to approach a particular puzzle or situation. The fact that your weapons break so often has been given as a negative by many people, but I find that it forces you to use your weapons more strategically, saving your best ones for the really hard enemies, and it also ensures that you'll actually use many of the ""lesser"" weapons in the game instead of just sticking with one best option.However, I find the game's story to be underwhelming. Part of this is due to the extreme freedom that you are given. You uncover many important parts of the story via flashbacks hidden around the map, and it's very possible (likely, even) that people will finish the game without having found all of these. This gives the story a fragmented feeling, and in general it just doesn't seem very engaging to me compared to most other games. I also found the voice acting to be surprisingly sub-par -- not bad, really, but not good either. Many of the English voice actors seem to have been miscast, and the game's writing style also doesn't really work that well with voice acting, giving many of the lines a stilted, awkward feeling. There's also very little actual voice work in the game -- to the point where I feel they might have been better off without voice acting at all.The game's exceptional sandbox world and game mechanics largely make up for these minor flaws, but I do feel like they keep the game from being a 10/10 (if this were a 10-point scale, I would give it a 9). But regardless, I would recommend this game highly to just about anyone.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Its honestly the greatest game I've ever played in my entire life. I've been playing since I was a kid when the original LOZ came out and this game has no equal.  Thats not hyperbole.  I adore OOT and just as it revolutionized 3D gaming when it was introduced, so has Breath of the Wild revolutionized open world gaming. It borrows a lot of concepts form past Zelda games and other open world games and prefects them. It sets the standard for how to create a truly open world, do ANYTHING, kind of game. The weapon durability system was an amazing fix to a myriad of issues that games like Skyrim and Fallout suffer from - mainly it allows for the world to stay open while still gating areas based on enemy difficulty (if you could keep the same level 50 sword all game you would sneak into the Castle, get a big sword, and just smash every small enemy on the map, making combat easy and stale.  It also prevents a player from constantly leaving the amazing exploration just to head back to town to sell off the weapons they picked up for cash.  I did that all the time in Skyrim and looting became the game.  I used the same powerful sword and just repaired it when needed.  I would then go sell everything else and continue.  No weapons to buy and sell and weapons constantly breaking means I stay in the wild, exploring and collecting the weapons my enemies drop and honestly, its so much more fun.  No grinding at that level. Plus, it encourages Korok seed exploration so you can increase inventory slots, it allows players to learn how to use all weapon types, it encourages using the environment for offense so you don't use your weapons as much and it encourages the use of meals/elixirs to add attack, defensive, and stealth buffs.  I honestly think its the most elegant solution to some bad open world problems and it encourages some fun and unique game play. The game has a few issues here or there, but its a perfect 5/5 and I couldn't possibly recommend it more.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

I absolutely love games that involve tons of exploring and this is the ultimate. I've played Myst, Riven, and many other exploration games but this is so gargantuan in size, absolutely nothing compares to it. After spending many hours of playing there is so much left to play. The graphics are beautiful and it runs perfectly. The controls are great and the story is kind of how you make it.

"Video game creators are finally realizing there is a bigger audience out there than the racers, the bubble poppers, and the graphic shooters. This game has restored my hope for a fun gaming future with my kids. It can be played slowly and methodically or straight to the story line objectives, there‚Äôs no wrong way. It has a good slow burn and I imagine will be enjoying many hours with it. My child has blasted through main quests and is now enjoying expansion packs and side quests. We‚Äôve had it for about 10 months. There are arrows flying and fighting monster creatures with crazy mythical powered swords and hammers but you are rarely taking aim at something that has human likeness (except those darn Yiga) and there‚Äôs no gore involved. In Zelda BOTW if you hunt a deer it falls into a nice little pile of raw prime meat, you pick it up, make a fire, and cook it with some herbs you found in the forest.  If you want more realism go play rdr2 after the kids are in bed. I‚Äôm sure it would have you up to your elbows in fake deer blood butchering the thing for a realistic 5 hours. Ha!Extremely enjoyable game. Best one available for the switch at this time. I am comfortable with my 4 year old watching and my 9 year old playing. In fact we often are all together jumping up and down cheering someone on to finish a quest or defeat a tough foe. There are many buttons you have to coordinate to control so players younger than about 7 would struggle but they can have fun wandering the forest collecting mushrooms when there‚Äôs no hazards present.Super fun.

"This game is incredible. It is so much fun to just explore the vast open world. The game makes traveling exciting by rewarding your patience, but also not making it too hard to find anything. I've never seen such a well-made world in a video game before this.I find the combat in this game to be reminiscent of the first Legend of Zelda in the sense that it is challenging. You can't just run at a large group of enemies and expect to come out unscathed. And as a player you get a great feeling of progression from developing combat skills and strategies. This is also one of the few games where sometimes stealth is the most fun option. And it's because the game doesn't tell you to sneak around. Instead it might present you with an enemy that you probably can't beat and let you make the decisions from there.It is such an immersive game. In many adventure games, the story feels set in stone, as if you as the player are just fulfilling check points that have to be there. In this game, you are eased into the story without too much exposition, and from there you can go straight to the final boss if you so desire. You will most definitely lose, but you can do it. Alternatively, you could go where the main quest takes you to try to prepare, or you could just do your own thing. The game truly makes you the protagonist because after the first ~10-30 minutes, it doesn't force you to do anything. You are the decision-maker with a vast world around you.The one and only major flaw in this game is the dungeons. They just aren't as exciting as the overworld and lack the combination of puzzles and combat that made Zelda dungeons so iconic. But, they are actually a relatively small part of the game and though they aren't particularly exciting, they aren't boring.This is the best game I have played in a long time. I strongly recommend it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Easily one of the best RPG ever release in the recent decade, and will remain as one of the legendary title for the rest of it's time. This game really sets the standard of what an open world game should feels like. Once you are into it, not many other game titles will be able to satisfy your palate. Fortunately the storyline wasn't some try-hard twist, but rather a straight forward cliche 'save the princess', typical Zelda like. Which in a way best suited for this, considering the game play, graphic and various element in the game. Personally, I feel that the balance of this game is almost at it's pinnacle.I ranked BOTW as one of the top 5 titles I have ever played till date (I should have clock over 100+ titles since the PS2 days).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,1,2022,√âtats-Unis
"The exploration in this game is more freeing, more fun, and more satisfying than any title I have played in a long time. Yes -- it might sound hokey, but, in all earnestness, I haven't felt so many 'wow' moments in a single-player game since I was a kid playing Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time -- when 3D console games still had the 'new' factor to lend to our enjoyment.After the PS2/GameCube era, I have felt like single-player games have lost a lot of their charm. And it's not just because the 'new' factor wore off, but because so many titles have fallen into big-budget developer pitfalls -- things like dark/violent settings (which often feel a little forced); incessant tutorial sequences; grinding mechanics that make progression feel like a chore; poorly written scripted sequences and cutscenes; etc.Occasionally these types of games produce something greater than the sum of their parts (like The Last of Us), but, largely, that classic feeling seemed to be fading away behind the rising wall of sameness.I say 'seemed' because, for me, Breath of the Wild changes all of that.I've never played a game that felt so tailor-made for my enjoyment -- as it combines elements from its own illustrious series with the atmospheric wonder of Shadow of the Colossus or Ico, the explorative 'what will I see next?' charm of older Final Fantasy games, a unique art style like Okami, Dark Cloud 2, or Beyond Good and Evil, a giant map full of breath-taking scenery like The Elder Scrolls and Red Dead Redemption, along with liberating traversal -- like if Lara Croft could climb ANY wall, or if Sora from Kingdom Hearts got the cool gliding ability at the beggining of the game instead of the near-end.Breath of the Wild takes all of this and manages to distill it into a cohesive, and long-lasting experience that is actually fun (an important word!) to play -- regardless of whether you are an existing The Legend of Zelda fan or a total newcomer.PLAY THIS GAME.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

The puzzles that you have to solve in these games are amazing and extremely well thought out.

"If there is one game that you are going to purchase for yourself on the Switch, then it should be Breath of the Wild. While many have considered the 3D Zelda series as becoming stagnant and repetitive, this seemed to be an overall reimagining of the franchise.Taking a page from open world RPGs like Skyrim and Fallout, Breath of the Wild is less about saving the princess in the castle and more about exploring and discovering a vast world. And what a world it is! With a visual style and music that is reminiscent of Miyazaki, the world of Breath of the Wild is vast and breathtaking,  giving the player a sense of discovery rarely found in games. Direction is not restrictive in Breath of the Wild. As Link, you can climb mountains, swim in the ocean and even quickly fight the main villain if you so choose.However, no game is without its flaws, and Breath of the Wild has its issues. For one, the directon-less nature of the game can be a flaw, especially if you end up in an area that is much harder than what you're currently capable of handling. Additionally, the weapon system is perhaps one of the worst I've ever experienced. Weapons, even the ones found late-game, break way too easily, causing one to hoard weapons for fear of breaking them when you need them most. Lastly, Shrines. While novel at first, Shrines in Botw eventually become tedious and repetitive. To the point where after seeing a shrine, I chose to skip it and maybe come back to it later. The issue with shrines even affected the Champion's Ballad DLC, where the game seemed to say ""Hope you like shrines, cause here's a whole lot more.""On the note of BOTW DLCs, I would say don't expect much. Master Trials, while fun, ultimately doesn't add much to the game. And while Champion's Ballad does add some back story and a new boss, it doesn't do anything interesting like add new enemies or expand upon the world.Despite its flaws I would say it's still worth it.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,4,2018,√âtats-Unis

"Nintedo took kind of a ""less is more"" approach to some aspects of BOTW in my opinion. The less-is-more approach does not apply to the map, which is HUGE and the scenery is amazing. The dungeons do not follow the tried and true Zelda formula; solve puzzles in a dungeon, find a piece of gear that will help you, defeat the boss with the item, repeat. This is not a bad thing, there are no special items used to defeat bosses and the dungeons can be beaten in any order you want, you could even fight the end boss right away if you wanted, if you could get to him. There is a bit of nostalgia that Zelda fans will recognize, but the game doesn't get carried away with it nor does it distract from the game itself. The open world concept is nice albeit a bit overwhelming at first.Pros:- Big, beautiful map with a lot of nice scenery- A lot to do, many side quests mixed in with the main story- Holds on to what makes Zelda Zelda. Nintendo succeeds with some new concepts but doesn't completely deviate from the tried and true series modelHowever, there are cons:- RPG style, not necessarily a con, but you could get so powerful to the point the end boss will be incredibly underwhelming- The sword combat mechanics are clunky, so much so it feels like sword fighting was designed to be a secondary combat method, which is not the Legend of ZeldaThe cons are minor and shouldn't stop you from getting the game if you're thinking about it, I am a Zelda fanatic and I really like how this game fits into the Legend of Zelda series, still not my favorite (Link to the Past, Twilight Princess), but any Zelda fan will really enjoy this game.By the way, your gear will break, no way around it, get used to it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
"In 1987 there was a gold cartridge that was obviously better than the rest. That's when I played Zelda for the first time. I was a toddler and still remember what an adventure it was. Since there was little text I could still play even though I had no one to read it to me. It was my driving force to learn to read and count. It was my favorite game year after year. Now 30 years later and this is almost the game I imagined from staring at the manual art and blocky pixels on that limited palette of the NES. I have not bought a Nintendo game in over a decade, and this was the first game that made me buy a nintendo console since the Cube.The world is vast and feels old giving a real feel of a adventure, the combat is ingauging, the difficulty is perfect, physics are the best around, cooking is accually entertaining and worth while, the ability to climb really adds something, the art design is great at hiding the 720p/900p resolution, and the ammount of things to see is awesome, the puzzles are well done for the most part, and the lack of direction harkens back to the NES game.On the downside the story is not in the league of say Witcher 3, the music can feel to subdued in my opinion, voice acting is sparse and should have been fully voiced or not at all, and the weapons do break to often.The gameplay makes up for all of this though. I am addicted to the gameplay, and you set the pace. I'm typically a 60fps4k pc gamer, but this game is just done so well.So is this game a nostalgia trip. YES! But it is an amazing experience. So here we are 30 years after the original golden cartridge that first really got me into video games and this is a worthy successor. My 4yo son sits with me when I let him. I help him play, and read him the text. It is one of his favorite things to do. He is starting to sounding out words with me and counting his money. Though he has me to read to him. Seriously this cartridge should have been gold.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Your weapon is going to break.  You just picked it up, you hit one dude with it, and now it's going to break.  Probably on the next hit.  It's going to do extra damage when it breaks, but then you're not going to have a weapon anymore, so there's that.You've picked up probably a hundred and fifty weapons over the two hours you've been playing, and every one of them has broken.  You think fondly of the one that lasted three battles.  That was fine craftsmanship, you think, as you pick up a club some dead goblin just dropped and hit another goblin with it and the game tells you your weapon is badly damaged and it's going to break.You've tried to account for this, but your inventory is limited to a handful of melee weapons, and no matter how many times you shoot somebody with a bow, every fight ends up being a melee fight.  Also, your bow just broke.Also, your club just broke.This game is an impressive technical achievement that is incredibly playable and fun and interesting and you found a new sword and the game just told you it's about to break.  Breath of the Wild will keep you coming back for hours, maybe days‚Äîlike it did me‚Äîwith a vast and varied world to explore and the sword you picked up a minute ago just broke.It sort of makes sense--this is postapocalyptic Hyrule, where even the tripods from War of the Worlds are mostly just broken-down wrecks (that will still kill you because it takes forty or fifty weapons' worth of hits to kill them and you can only carry six) but given the number of critters there are to kill and the rate at which weapons break (and yours just broke) you're really starting to wonder how they didn't run out of weapons about 13 minutes after the apocalypse all this is supposed to be post-.Overall, you think as your weapon breaks, this would be a five-star game--probably one of the best games of all time if not *the* best--if they had addressed some balance issues before it shipped, like how often your weapons break.By the way, your weapon just broke.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"The only thing that I could say is that I didn't like was that your items break. Having said that, the fact becomes insignificant next to the abundance of ways in which you can recover items, money, and everything else. There might not be any of the 4 classic dungeons that all Zelda fans are used to but there are many puzzle and riddle like challenges that one must overcome in order the achieve game completion. The game does take a lot of time but even if you have a full time job like I do you will not get lost when you come back to it since the game provides an easy and not at all time consuming way to keep you on track.

"Whether you want to kill enemies, cook food, hunt animals, explore gorgeous scenery, paraglide the skys, mountain climb everything, and/or horse back the beaten path, this game has just about everything. There is no wrong way to play. You see something cool, you can freely travel there anx explore. I grew up on gameboy color Zelda, Oralce of Ages, followed by Oracle of Seasons. On the SwitchLite I feel like I'm playing a Gameboy Color for the first time again. Everything is done so well. Some parts of the game frustrate me so much. But everything has a reason. If you think something is a puzzle, it probably is. I overlooked horses most of the time I played, but recently discovered how amazing a mechanic it is. Everything about this game made me fall in love with Link, Zelda, and Hyrule all over again. Hands down top 10 best games I have ever played. The use of motion control in the game is truly the cherry on top. I can finally aim in a game with stick controls. Finally have a game I would rather play than browse the internet. Been waiting 2 years to play this game. And oh boy has it delivered! So much information/walkthroughs is/are available online, but I keep reminding myself the best part is figuring it out for myself.

"I see a lot of people giving this game a perfect score and I honestly don't see how you can when it has so many faults/flaws.  It is a great game, but not even one of the top 3 Zelda games in my opinion.Pro'sOpen world+truly a huge world.  absolutely massiveTons of exploration+120 shrines, each is 1-2 rooms of a traditional Zelda gameTons of mini questsActual voice acting for about 10-15% of main story (none for link, and there are still large walls of text to read).Cons (IE, things people overlook when giving it a perfect score-Graphical popping, texture issues, slow down when near big/numerous enemiesThe switch isn't really that powerful and it struggles here on a launch title.  This has me a little worried for the console.- All those quests...95% reward you with 100-300 rupees. But the things you actually spend money on cost 1000-10,0000.  And many quests take 30+ minutes.  So you spend an hour doing 2 quests for 200 rupees.  It feels very unrewarding.-Very very very small story.  You get Intro 4 shrines, 4 main town dungeons, and last boss.  Super speed runs aside, you can beat the full story in about 5-10 hours.  You're supposed to supplement that time with all of the side quests, but see above.- Dungeon wise, you have 4 small (by Zelda standards) dungeons and then 1 massive dungeon with the last boss.  I am accustomed to 8-10 dungeons in a Zelda game so this was super short.- You start the game with all of your tools.  I loved the old style of new tools in new dungeons unlocking new areas.  Starting with everything makes the 4 dungeons you do seem less important.------The biggest issue for me, weapons and shields break.  So you have to constantly stock up on more.  I have never cared for games with limited durability weapons/armors.  You like that shiny new sword?  Aw, it broke one enemy later.  Even the master sword breaks...though it does regenerate after 10 minutes without it.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Breath of the Wild places you in an unfamiliar world and challenges you to explore it. It slowly and cleverly teaches you how to interact with its world while allowing the player to discover (and fail) on their own.My favorite part of Zelda games has always been exploring for the overworld for heart pieces/items and using dungeons to break those up. This game is almost entirely exploration and it's so fun to climb mountains, attack enemy camps, and search for shrines. I honestly find dungeons kind of frustrating in Zelda, as I usually end up getting stuck because I forgot to look behind one spot or missed a key somewhere. The shrines are perfect for me, a quick 5-10 minute puzzle that I can run through before moving on to the next thing.They also nailed the major issue I have with 3D Zeldas, namely that it takes too long to get anywhere. Fast travel opens up almost immediately after the game starts. What's better is there are tons of stuff to discover on the way to new areas. People on the roads, enemy camps, shrines, new plants, and animals etc.Finally, I have to comment on the people scattered throughout Hyrule. They're an utterly charming bunch of characters. My favorite was a man who offered to give me a tour of Hateno Village. His brimming enthusiasm about his town even though he was out of breath running from place to place put a big smile on my face.Even after putting dozens of hours into the game I can't wait to go home and play it some more. I haven't felt this way since Super Mario Galaxy and I've never had this feeling sustained for 60+ hours of gameplay. Nintendo pulled off an incredible feat, making a Zelda in the style of open world classics while outdoing other games in the genre in almost every way.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"El mejor juego que puedes comprar si piensas adquirir un nintendo switch, y el juego por el que vale la pena comprar uno. Es un juego inmersivo y extenso, un tanto diferente a los dem√°s juegos de Zelda, ya que no cuenta con calabozos muy complejos, pero hay santuarios que ofrecen desafios con diferente nivel de dificultad.

"Easily one of the best Zelda games ever, and also the most difficult.  But that is a good thing, since I rarely ever died in other Zeldas.  In this one, you will probably die a lot, especially in the earlier stages before you get around to doing armor upgrades.  As the game progresses, you will die less, but it is still more challenging than any Zelda before or since.If there was 1 thing I wish they focused on more, it would probably be the storyline.  While the cutscenes are good, they are quite few and far between.  After you finish the Divine beasts, you will probably want to finish the shrines and upgrade armor before fighting Ganon.  At that point, there is a HUGE gap in story.  Ultimately, I wish there were something a little more linear.  I also wish all parts of the world could have been more connected story-wise.  Hopefully BotW II will focus a little more on this.All in all though, solid game and highly recommended.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Love this game. I had been following the development cycle of it since I first heard about the game back in 2013 for the Wii U. I'm not a big gamer, my list of games that I've invested time in is very short from my adult life over the past 22 years. That short list includes Mario Kart 64, 007 Golden Eye, Perfect Dark, Resident Evil 2, Transformers Fall of Cybertron, Wii U Mario 3D World, Transformers Earth Wars, and (on the Switch) Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and finally Zelda Breath of the Wild.I don't really like to play video games much, but every now and then a game catches my interest. BotW is a winner. My daughter and I (and her buddy next door) have had a lot of fun exploring the world, fighting bad guys, collecting things from and exploring the open world environment, getting a horse, playing the mini-games, etc. We love that you can just do whatever you want to do. Want to climb the mountain? Have fun. Want to cook some food? Enjoy! Want to go hang gliding from mountain top to mountain top? Knock yourself out.We've been playing it for about 2 weeks and have managed to cover very little ground (just made it to Kakariko Village). We haven't gotten far in two weeks but we have been exploring everything, taking it all in. We won't be finishing this game any time soon. It's just too damn big! I'm OK with that though. I'm getting my money's worth out of this game and if it takes us a year or 3 years to play at our leisure and just explore everything, that would be AOK with me.Like I said, I'm not much of a gamer. We're just having fun exploring this open world environment where we can do whatever we want.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Hands down one of the best Zelda games I've ever played.PROS:-The graphical style is kind of a mix of Twilight Princess and Wind Waker - should help the game's graphics age well while enabling an immersive experience.-The huge open world.  Normally when you see a mountain in the distance, it's just a picture.  Here, you can walk to it.  At any point in the game.-Runes and climbing provide ample means of exploring and manipulating the environment.  I'd say there's plenty of opportunity to sequence-break, but there's not really much of a ""sequence"" to start with.  The game is yours.-Compendium:  Adds an element of collectathon to the game.  Something for completionists to strive for while being useful to they leyperson (can be used to track items/monsters or let you know if you've seen it before)-Amiibo usage:  you can get unique items in-game (such as the Fierce Deity Armor).  For those without Amiibo, worry not, these don't count at all towards 100% as none of them appear in the Compendium-Durability helps keep the gameplay from stagnating.  You have the best weapon in the game?  Not for long!  Particularly with the weapons you find laying around, it also makes a lot of sense.  I wouldn't expect a 100-year old, rusted sword to fare well in a fight with a Lynel-Master Mode provides ample challenge for those who seek it.  Don't believe me?  Go fight a Lynel with a stick on the Great Plateau (fortunately this mode is optional)CONS:-Durability can sometimes get old.  Like, I don't want to use my Fierce Deity Sword because it'd break, and then I'd need to Amiibo farm for a new one.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Let me preface by saying that I'm not a huge Zelda fanboy. I hold nothing against the series, I was just never that into it. Based on the reviews, I was expecting the pinnacle of open world gaming on the Switch. Instead I am treated to a seemingly never-ending sequence of climbing, gliding, fighting, and cooking. Although an aesthetically beautiful game, with simple mechanics, there are some flaws that are really killing my buzz.The shrines are too far in between and far too short. I've found one repeat shrine (Small Test of Strength) and assume there are more. After the tutorial area shrines, there's no storyline requirement to hit any shrines. They are merely there for you to grind hearts and stamina. The Divine Beasts are more enjoyable dungeon experiences due to their size and complexity. I wish there were fewer, more involved shrines with better rewards.There is little variety in the monsters you'll come across, except that some groups are substantially stronger than others with no visual indication. A major source of frustration to me has been hopping one region over and being OHKO by the exact same creature that was previously hitting for a half heart per hit. This KILLS the open world feel for me because I feel as if I'm being herded through the easier regions.The weapon and shield inventory limits are ridiculous considering how quickly these items break. I have this gripe with many games, but monsters don't play by the same rules. Hit their shields as much as you like--they won't break. Tank as much damage as you want--they're still holding pristine weapons. The handful of repairable weapons in the world just don't cut it, as they can only be reforged by certain NPCs and it costs a stupid amount of resources. This is the first game I've played in close to 25 years of gaming where weapons break with this frequency and it is maddening.The world is expansive, but it's mostly open, empty space. I do like that there are little secrets sprinkled throughout a region--not concentrated around a settlement or something. But by and large you can make a bee-line from one point of interest to the next without missing anything important. In light of my above complaints, this is probably the safer way to play. And that's really the problem. If a game doesn't reward exploration, why make it massively explorable?",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I love this game it brings back that wide vast open world feeling that the first Zelda game had with its vast huge open world with no limits you can go anywhere! Though I must say it may have too much open space because with this huge vast open world game it tends to feel almost too big with enemies being sometimes way to far apart of way to close together, unless you get a horse you will find yourself running around all over the place to the point they might have just implemented a Pok√©mon go thing in there (I'm sorry about that).Combat can be a little dull at the beginning since advanced combat training isn't taught until later in the game (because now these days games just don't come with manuals anymore like the old days)I must say though weapon breaking which is highly in this game tends to be annoying and you'll often find yourself breaking your 12 damage sword and then have to use a 6 damage club that you picked up from the dead enemy you just broke your sword on until later in the game.Grinding and collecting materials for food that you can cook or monster parts you use to create elixir is something that is fun to experiment but can also be annoying and it's highly encouraged you bring foods that can heal you up faster.As for gameplay it's a solid 5/5 stars, not once have I had lag issues or freezing and not even frame drops has happened to meThough as any Zelda fan knows they would agree that this game does break some old Zelda tradition such as the weapon breaking, another is how in past Zelda games you were able to name yourself but in here you don't get that option.I love this game and can't get enough of it and I would highly encourage getting this game (especially over the 1-2 switch game)",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Simply sublime. Huge map to explore, densely packed with fun and interesting optional details. Day and night cycles, lunar phases, treacherous thunderstorms and brilliant sunshiny mornings. Chirps of songbirds, cries of wildlife, tall grass and snowy peaks, forests and beaches, capes and islands. Walk, ride, climb or fly. The soft palette just caresses the senses.Uncover the map by searching for towers and shrines that power you up and unlock fast travel. Puzzles and enemies are challenging but fair. I completely eschewed any guides just to savour the experience. There are amusing treasure hunt challenges that expand your inventory - mitigating the weapon durability mechanic which prevents over-reliance on any super-weapon. Controls are simple and intuitive, even for a mouse/keyboard user like myself. X-Y inversion is available.There are nice cutscenes with dialogue whenever the story transitions, but mostly this is a quiet, meditative experience, backed by a sweet, unobtrusive, unrepetitive score. I could go on but i will just end by saying that I waited 3 years to afford this game (and console) and now it‚Äôs one of my all-time favourite things.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,12,2020,Singapour
"One of the best games I've played.  I love Zelda games but to be honest it's been a long time since I been entranced by a Zelda game.  I just didn't think the latest Zelda games prior to Breath of the Wild lived up to their hype.  So I didn't think BotW would either and the videos online didn't really capture my attention either.  But it's hard to capture how fun it is in a video.Normally I lose interest pretty fast in open world games because there is just so much to do and the growing list feels daunting.  BotW's world is insanely massive, as in it makes Skyrim's world look small, but I don't find myself losing interest.  In fact I have the opposite problem.  Once I feel like I have asserted my dominance in one area I see another area off in the distance that piques my interest and in BotW you can go anywhere you can see.  No invisible walls or mountains too high.And then the game rewards you if you like to experiment.  It doesn't punish you and try to limit it eggs you on.  The potion/cooking system alone will give you useful rewards for experiments.  But it doesn't stop there.  You can change the properties of many things just by exposing them to the elements.  You may be weak to an element (heat/cold) but you can use items in various ways to overcome the environment.  You may also find yourself weaker to an element by what you're doing.  (e.g. don't wield a metal weapon during a lightning storm ...or swim)  Sloshing around in puddles will alert your presence to the enemy but sometimes bad weather and/or nighttime can help you sneak up on them.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,11,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I can still remember my father taking me to a Toys R' Us to pick out a new NES game back in the 80s when I saw this bright gold box and cartridge  on display for the first Legend of Zelda game.  It absolutely blew me away at that the time and for many years after through Ocarina of Time I couldn't get enough Zelda but for a few generations (Gamecube/Wii/Wii U) I haven't enjoyed much of what was putting out including Zelda.  Now as I'm a bit older with more disposable income I decided to preorder the Switch and Breath of the Wild to give Nintendo ONE more try.  I am so happy I did because this is hands down the best game I've played on any current generation system.I finished Final Fantasy XV recently and had a blast but it was by no means perfect.  I then picked up Horizon Zero Dawn thinking it would keep me  busy for weeks if not months to come but unlike most who have enjoyed the game I just didn't get into it.  This is what brings me to the new Zelda, it might not be a graphical powerhouse but as a game it is so much more fun in terms of gameplay alone that everything else suddenly pales in comparison. Showing that at the end of the day it isn't just about resolution.  Heck, I have the Switch hooked up to a 4K Sony Bravia (75"") and Breath of the Wild looks beautiful.  If you have a Switch right out of the gate then this is a no-brainer.  There isn't much more out there and this is the must own title.It has been quite a few years since I would consider myself a Nintendo fanboy but with this one title alone Nintendo has made me a believer again.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Like the headline suggested, I don't really play open world games, I've try so many time with GTA 1-5 and playing it always burns me out before actually finishing the game. I'm a big Zelda fan since the the first Zelda and Zelda 2 (couldn't finish it)came out on nes, played each games that came after and even the handheld s(my favorite is Link's Awakening).Given my history with open world games I didn't know what to expect from BOtW, but I love zelda and I figured I'll keep and open mind about it and I'm glad I did because BOtW is awesome and no words can explain how much I love this game.So much little details that'll youll miss first but after a few hours in you'll notice it or someone would point it out or you'll read it online somewhere, there's so many things going on the world that you just have to really sit down and explore. BOtW is by far the best Zelda game I've played to date, as much as I love BOtW and its gameplay I still missed the motion control and the puzzles that uses it in Skyward, if I had to say although there are tons of puzzle shrines in BoTW they are still the same with minor variation and I think they're to me personally is why prefer skyward sword. I love the open world apporch in BoTW but also love the gameplay in Skyward.BotW is an Awesome entry to the series that does a good job breaking away from the traditional Zelda but in a good way, but I wouldn't say the first time Zelda players should be discourage from playing the past games because they're great on their own.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"First I have to say I‚Äôm a huge Zelda fan. Ocarina of Time is my favorite game ever made period.So I went into this with high hopes to begin with, then IGN rated the game a perfect 10, a masterpiece? Whoa....okay so is this the game that justifies me spending $300 for a new system?....by Nintendo?So, to answer those all in order....Yes, God Yes, and Hell Yes! This game is everything and more. As of writing this I‚Äôm a good 20-30hrs in and I feel like I‚Äôve only scratched the surface. This game is insane and a love letter to anyone that looked up to a little hero named Link. First thing out of the gate are the graphics which are stunning. It‚Äôs a newer Windwaker type of grown up art? If that makes sense...anyway the cell shading and style are stunning. I have honestly sat there staring at the screen and just drinking up everything I see. The controls are tight but do getting some used to. That is more of my own personal learning curve then anything against the game. The story is engaging and makes you want to keep working to uncover more of it. I never felt like something was repetitive and each shrine challenge felt like I was getting something out of it and growing my character.  Overall I‚Äôve been blown away. I knew this game was going to be fun, but I had no idea it would be as incredible as it is.  This game and Mario Odyssey are now two of my all time favorite games ever made and so make buying a new system totally worth it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,7,2018,√âtats-Unis

"It was certainly overhyped, but still really fun. The game plays its cards too early; except for four helpful but ultimately unnecessary abilities, the game gives you everything you're going to get right at the start, rather than parceled out like in the other 3D titles, but also without the amount of variety that Link Between Worlds had in its item rental system. As the game moves on, upgrading armors becomes a chore and the Master Sword is ultimately underwhelming. The 'Apparatus' puzzles are just generally awful. The bosses are too easy, and far from the most difficult enemies. The ending is so anti-climactic. BotW has some of the best dialogue writing of the series, especially in the side quests, but the voice actors for the cinematics are all so stilted and robotic.What the game does do well is innovate on a stale IP. There's less platforming overall, but the platforming there is is far more forgiving since the player now has much better control over jumping and gliding. The slow motion aiming mid-air is a fantastic touch. The ability to climb literally anything makes for an open world game that *actually* feels open world. Though I wish that some of the shrines had been more challenging, there was a great amount of variety in them. The combat learning curve is nearly perfect. And as someone who didn't give a rats patoot about the previous games' fishing mini-games, I loved the new bomb-fishing method. Of the two 'stealth' missions, one was fantastic - the other was a chore.Change is good and the franchise needs more of it, but it also needs to remember some old lessons again. I'm really torn between this and Windwaker as my top title in the series - BotW does open world far better, but Windwaker still beats it in so many other aspects.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

"and I gotta say, this game really blew me away.  I'm a huge fan of open world games in general, so it already had that going for it, but I honestly thought it did just about everything right.Visuals:  Absolutely beautiful.  The world is incredibly colorful and beautifully rendered.  The character designs are lively and do a fantastic job of evoking their original iterations from prior games with a new flair and visual appeal (I said I didn't put any 'serious' effort into the old games, not that I hadn't played them).Sound/Music:  Also beautiful.  Updated takes on classic sounds and tunes melding perfectly with some newly orchestrated pieces.  The voice acting is a little 50/50, but the ones that do a good job (like the actress voicing Zelda) are FANTASTIC and the others are nod BAD per se, just kinda goofy, like saturday morning cartoon goofy.Story:  Waaaaay better than I expected.  The memories you unlock of Link and Zelda's past are quite well written.  Some of the side characters are your standard character archetypes, but nothing too cheesy.Controls:  I would probably take a half point off for the horse riding and the countering mechanics.  Those are harder to use than I feel they should have been.  Personally, I just never used a horse and did more dodging that blocking, so it evened out.  Everything else is really solid.  Combat, movement, inventory management, all fluid and intuitive.I'd give this a solid 9/10 (rounded up to 5 stars)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"There are only three things I need to say about this game.1) This is everything I ever wanted in a Legend of Zelda game. The open-world nature lends greatly to hours upon hours of restless exploration. I personally am infatuated with exploration games, and I feel as though Breath of The Wild does an incredible job at giving the player a vast world to explore.2) Equipment durability is a pain in the butt! But it adds a layer of depth to the experience, requiring you to get tactical. Save your strongest weapons for the strongest enemies. A variety of weapons will save you. Varying materials will also save you. Few situations suck more than being stuck in a lightning storm with only metal shields, bows, and melee weapons. If you have no wooden equipment, prepare to have a bad day.3) Many conventional Zelda tropes are dropped, such as doing things in a specific order. This is similar to how A Link Between Worlds allowed you to tackle challenges in any order you desired.Those are the three most important points of this game, I think. An open world in which many previous tropes are cast aside and new mechanics give new challenges to a series that has been largely the same from iteration to iteration. That's it in one sentence.The short and skinny is this: If you are a fan of The Legend of Zelda, I think you owe it to yourself to play this game. Even if you find that it's not for you, you can at least say you gave it a fair chance.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,6,2018,√âtats-Unis

"I am a huge Zelda fan and this game is breathtaking.  The graphics are great with still having a ""cartoon"" like feel.  What is great about this game is that you can complete it in any order you wish.  You have the freedom to choose how to play while strengthening Link.  There are so many side missions to complete and fun shrine quests.  I highly recommend this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,4,2022,√âtats-Unis

"This game is impressive. Initially I was put off by the high price of Nintendo games, but the number of hours of gameplay makes it worth it. However, you have to have enough free time to enjoy it. Prior to the corona shutdown I wouldn't have enjoyed this game at all because I was way to busy.  Instead, I stuck to games that allow for quick gameplay (e.g. Smash Bros, Mario Kart, etc).  As one review mentioned, you can spend a lot of time just travelling, and that is frustrating if you only have 30 min a day to play. I have tried to do most of the game on my own, but I have used a number of online videos to get through some parts since I don't have THAT much time :-)I have almost completed the game and am currently completing side missions before taking on the final boss. I know that once the shutdown is over it will be a long time before I will be able to dedicate so much time to a game üòä",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I want to give this five stars... but it's closer to 3. My love of the series DEMANDS I give it four though - here's why:--Your weapons have durability. Horrendously low durability. You will often break your weapon before a single fight is over, or maybe multiple weapons. And you have limited weapon slots. The real kicker is many clever puzzle solutions require that you have a certain type of weapon on hand (A hammer, axe and korok leaf are often required) but with the harshly limited slots AND extremely low durability, you'll find yourself carrying 5 different weapons that you don't even like because everything you DO enjoy fighting with is broken in seconds! And yes, even the master sword breaks. No joke!-- They've broken tradition and left the grandiose music of yesteryear behind. I want my Saria's Song and Song of Storms, Song of Time, Song of Healing, Midna's Song, etc back! Hyrule isn't the same with dull, passive music playing instead of deeply immersive tunes I still find myself unconsciously humming DECADES after playing those games.Otherwise the game is fantastic. A little too childish with certain characters (the Zora's are sickening!), but it's Zelda and I'm an old man now so of course I'd say that (Majora's Mask, where art thou?). Great challenge - I play with only base-3 heart containers, have fun kids - clever puzzles and a wonderful world to explore. So close to perfect... but the weapon breaking is a terrible, terrible, at times even crippling design choice (you can be totally unable to fight if there are enough enemies at once).",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
I never thought that a Legend of Zelda game could be this awesome. It‚Äôs a MUST HAVE on your Nintendo Switch.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,7,2022,√âtats-Unis
"I don't mean to jump on the bandwagon, but this is honestly the best Zelda game I've played so far. Here are some complaints that I've read, and my response:1. The game is too hard: Get good.2. I hate the weapon durability: It's just an added mechanic to make you have to think more. There are PLENTY of weapons throughout the game where you really don't feel defenseless. You can also expand your inventory to hold even more weapons.3. The game is too easy: Have you explored EVERYTHING? Sure, just blazing through the story isn't too difficult, but there is so much to do, and none of it seems repetitive. In addition, hard mode DLC is coming out.4. Frame rate drops: Is this really an issue that detracts from the gameplay? It very seldom slows down.5. The rain is inconvenient: See answer to #1.6. The graphics don't compare to PS4 or Xbone: Graphics aren't everything, but also the style is more artistic than realistic. You feel like you're immersed in a Miyazaki film.7. I don't know what I'm supposed to do next: Really it doesn't matter what you do next. Pick a direction and go that way. Something will pop up. The whole point of this game is to give the gamers the freedom to do what they want.8. The voice acting is bad: I personally liked the voice acting, but that's just my opinion. I also appreciate the use of the voice acting. It wasn't too frequent, and it was only during important cutscenes.Definitely a 10/10 game",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Breath of the Wild reigns as the most positively overwhelming game I've ever experienced. It went very much beyond the high expectations I had for it, especially considering my long history with the Legend of Zelda series.The best part of the game easily comes down to the engagement the player has with the environment. Pretty much anything that's around you can be engaged with. A bird in the background? Shoot it with your motion-controlled bow and collect it's meat to then cook it in the game's complex cooking system. Hear a cricket? Find it in the beautifully rendered fields and combine it with other materials to make elixirs. The list is practically endless with the countless amount of activities that you can get yourself lost in.From climbing any visible cliff or mountain, to exploring the world for the 120 puzzle-based dungeons or the 900 hidden Koruk seeds (used for inventory expansion), Breath of the Wild captures everything you could hope for. The graphical design of the game had me stunned when I first opened it. The typically peaceful music that plays as you explore the massive world of Hyrule creates an incrediblly unique experience. Because there are too many things that I can list to praise this wonderful game, I'll conclude by saying that if you want to satisfy any kind of entertainment you're looking for in today's era, pick up and play the hundreds of hours to come on the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Wow.  Just wow! I'm so impressed with the actual game play.  (Not into those first person shooters).Kids don't like it because there is not enough action.  It takes some patience.  There are also lots of in game videos that repeat themselves.But the game is amazing.  Winter, rain, sun and wind.  Gravity is even amazing.  I'm also impressed with shadows.  The bad guys are hard to beat and the shrines which are mostly mini games are challenging.If you Are a fan of Zelda,  you know you  must talk to people in the towns and read their every word.  They often unlock new challenges or redirect game play or lead you to places. Their talk is sometimes funny and sometimes annoying.  (Best talk and in game videos for me was Ratchet and Clank).There are unique towns and characters everywhere.But the scenery is truely breath taking.The controls are a little difficult to get used to.  Pushing on the left joystick causes Link to crouch and sometimes when I'm fighting a boss person and game play is intense, Link crouches because I've pushed a little too hard.  Of course not good when someone is attacking.Crouching is good when you want to get closer to your enemies or hop on a horse.Hopping on a horse is exciting.  Some horses are easily won while others need more effort in controlling them.so much more to say and not enough room.  Well worth the purchase.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I'm going to start by saying that I have owned the Wii U version of this game.  With that said, I can tell you the difference in resolution is barely noticeable, and in just a few cases only, and even then, it doesn't affect the visual; in fact, the Switch's version visuals are a big upgrade from Wii U's.  There are more details, more colors, and there are more little details like more grass and flowers around.  Not necessarily a good thing all the time, as they can sometimes hide goodies... but in a way, it makes finding stuff more satisfying.  Also, there are slight, but welcome addition to detail on shadows and reflections.  That aside, I played the game first without the updates installed.  Not much difference in terms of framerate and smoothness from the Wii U version.  AFTER updating, however, the significant increase in smoothness of framerate and overall animations in the game has made me go ""WOW"" all over again.  Loading times aren't that different, however, but Switch is still faster by seconds.  Overall, I believe this wonderfully huge game, where you are free to roam the vast land of Hyrule to find treasure, upgrades, tools, food, and fight baddies, while following a slow, but interesting story that is barely there to interrupt your exploration, is worth buying and playing from one corner to the next, and back, and I do plan on getting the DLC contend for this very soon.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,8,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Beautiful game. I loved playing it. So much to explore landscape wise anyway. I only wish they had put more into the story...like being able to control the weather. It rained a lot in the game and that took some enjoyment out of the game for me. And when I say it rained a lot...I mean it rained...a lot! If they had worked some sort of weather control into the story that would have been cool. But this is only one small complaint that I had about the game because as time went on and I conquered the Divine Beasts, the weather didn't matter so much...and I'm talking about climbing here.One other thing I wish they had done would be to have some diversity into the dungeon bosses. They all looked the same to me and all but one of them were pretty easily beaten once you had gotten far enough into the game. One of them, was kind of tough...but I have no doubts in a replay, I could easily take him down as well.Also the final boss was WAY too easy to beat. I couldn't believe it when I finally faced Gannon just how easily he was conquered. I expected more out of the end fight than that...this is after all, The Legend of Zelda. I found some of the over world bosses much more difficult to beat...and I'm talking about the Lynels here. They were really tough...but I did enjoy fighting them, much more than I did fighting Gannon.Again the game is beautiful and I loved exploring the landscape and all it had to offer, but I just wish there had been a little more.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I am a huge Zelda fan and when I heard some of the things about the new Zelda game coming out I started getting nervous. I feared that this game was not going to satisfy me like its predecessors.When I got the game and about half way through it I realized something...I realized that this is not a Zelda game. That this not the same game that I fell in love with throughout the years.They took out all the things that make a Zelda game great. All the characteristics of a Zelda game.such as giving you all the of your gadgets right up front. In the past I loved it when you came up to a rocky ledge and realized you had to wait and get the hook-shot to get up there, which you had to wait until the 3rd dungeon to get! You didn't appreciate your weapons as much in this game because you didn't work hard to get them. I remember in Majoras Mask and Ocarina you had to do various quests to get the most powerful swords in the game and that that gave you a sense of pride once you obtained them. In Breath of the Wild they gave you a plethora of fancy looking weapons....that brake! Too much is not always a good thing.One of the other things that got to me was the side quests in the game. The rewards are crap! There are so many quest that sound fun but give you mainly rupees or other items you can just sell for more rupees. Why do the side quests when you can just seek out ore deposits that deliver more goods? Where's the heart pieces that give you an urgency to find and collect them?? The best items in the game you can just get from shrines or mini bosses.And how 'bout those shrines? They were fun for a little while and then it just gets repetitive. Just when I feel like I'm doing something new it reveals another shrine. It seamed like everything revolved around  these shrines. Where are all the Temples and dungeons that take an hour or two to complete which give you another sense of pride? Or the cool gadgets that help you to finish the dungeon and defeat the dungeon boss? And now that you have that  gadget you can go get some more heart pieces you saw earlier... There's only 4 dungeons that take 15 maybe 20 minutes to complete. The bosses weren't half bad. The Ganon boss was okay.The story... You went around finding memories that slowly gave you details to a predictable ending. I did connect to Zelda's struggles though.Some minor problems with the game are that they got rid of cutting grass to get items, hearts, rupees etc. Bottles.I think the freedom of the game was not a good thing. In this game you don't earn freedom, but you were given freedom. Which ruined it for me.I feel like the creators sacrificed quality over quantity. I give this game a 7. And as a portable game alone, I give it an 8.5.I fear that because this  game got high ratings that Nintendo will keep up this Zelda trend. I hope i'm wrong.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"So I love this game. It‚Äôs very expansive and the world is entirely open! I love all the references to old characters and storylines.What I don‚Äôt like about the game is that it is almost everything the Zelda series has never been.**Spoilers below!**I hate how you can literally just get off the Plateau and head straight for Ganon. You literally don‚Äôt have to do any of the rest of the story. All of the big parts are optional! You don‚Äôt have to get the Master Sword, you don‚Äôt have to recover all of Link‚Äôs lost memories. You don‚Äôt even have to recover the divine beasts and put your friends‚Äô spirits at rest. Perhaps for the avid roleplayer this is nice, having no restrictions, but that takes away what makes a good Zelda game.Personally, I enjoyed the dungeon-driven Zelda games. I liked the dungeons, I liked the item requirements for certain areas. None of this ‚Äúrune‚Äù bullshit. I don‚Äôt like how my weapons break.**END SPOILER**This is a good game. I have put like 200 hours into it. It‚Äôs just not a good Zelda game. Most of the elements associated with Zelda are gone. It feels like someone took characters named Impa, Link, and Zelda and just tossed them in a completely different genre of game and expected it to come out to be a good Zelda title. It‚Äôs not. Regardless, it was a fun game and I don‚Äôt regret my purchase.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This is by far the best Zelda game to ever be released.  Link to the Past, great, Orcarina of Time, amazing, Majora's Mask, now my number 2 Zelda, and Link Between Worlds, 3rd favorite.  This trumps them all.One part Skyrim, One part Dark Souls.  While there is a story line, you are free to go where you want, if you can survive!  Which leads into difficulty.  This game is not as easy as past Zelda games.  Weapons break, so you are constantly swapping them out.  The boomarang for example, you have to actively catch it when it comes back.  No more throw away and forget about it.  No hearts lying around, the crafting system lets you cook food to refill lost life.  The combat system is amazing, challenging, unforgiving, and rewarding.The story I have played so far is very good.  I am not sure how or where in the Zelda timeline this game fits, there are plenty theories around the internet though.  While games like Halo were enough to get people to buy an Xbox, this game is a system seller.  If you dont have the cash for a switch any time soon, pick this up on the Wii U if you have one.  Game is worth twice the asking price compared to the garbage Ubisoft and others have given us the past few years (though I hear Ubisoft is back on the up and up lately).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Si tienes una Nintendo Switch, el juego de Zelda: Breath of the Wild es una compra obligatoria, es f√°cilmente un juego que te puede dar de 100 a 300 horas de juego dependiendo de como lo juegues, ya que tu decides en todo momento como jugarlo, sin que el juego te gui√© de la mano como suced√≠a normalmente en entregas anteriores. Aunque si bien en esta entrega de Zelda le fallan algunos detallitos m√≠nimos es demasiado bueno en muchos otros aspectos y hasta revolucionario se podr√≠a decir. Soy fan de Zelda desde la generaci√≥n de Nintendo 64 y si bien esta en duda decir si es o no el mejor de la franquicia si se puede decir con total seguridad que esta entre los mejores.Por el otro lado el producto que me llego es nuevo, original y sellado, llego en la fecha de entrega establecida y no tuve ning√∫n otro problema ya que lo tengo desde hace unos meses, 100% recomendado comprarlo en esta pagina ya que quien lo vende es directamente Amazon M√©xico.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,9,2020,Mexique
"I'm usually not a big fan of open world games. Also haven't played much Zelda in general. That might give my review more value, since I didn't really have the level of hype that most fans did and my perception of how the game actually is wasn't potentially clouded by excitement.What I like so far about BOTW is how atmospheric it is. When your not fighting monsters, it's so quiet you can hear the trees rustling or birds chirping. It just gives you that sense of 'calm before the storm.'I also like how your not bombarded too heavily with side quests and tedious tasks that have put me off with other open world games. You really do feel like you can do whatever you want and you have so many options available to you like when it comes to attacking a Bokoblin camp.On the other hand, it does bug me how often your weapons break, but that's not so much a problem I have, as much as it's just an aspect of the game that ensures your constantly getting new equipment. It definitely sucks when your surrounded by enemies and your sword breaks üò≥.Overall, I am really enjoying the game even though I don't typically like open world games, and I haven't played a lot of the Zelda franchise. The parts that frustrate me aren't issues I have, but just difficult sections of the game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Really fun game to play. Has a massive open world with really good graphics and a great artstyle that shows off a beautiful world. The story is easy to follow, the main quest is accessible even for casual gamers. It could have been harder in some ways, and some gamers might miss that in areas.I found the casual enemy encounters to be scaled well in difficulty. Especially as you advance in the game. The fighting mechanic is pretty good as well. You can just run in and mash buttons but the enemies are tough and smart so dying is likely with that method which encourages thinking before acting or honing your fighting skills to effectively dodge or counter an enemies attack.There is voice acting in this game for the first time ever. It wasn't bad but I think it really could have been better. At times I felt it was really disjointed and I hope if Nintendo does voice acting again that it will be executed better.All in all I have put almost 200 hours into this game. It is completely worth it. I had so much fun, there's a ton to do. Those are really the only complaints I have. It is a very great game I have played a ton and have watched a ton of people play. And it's amazing the difference every person makes in their play style. I love it, so much variety. I would recommend this game to everyone I know.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is the Zelda I have been waiting for since Ocarina of Time. This game is not perfect, however its strengths greatly outweigh its flaws.The open world is more rewarding than other games with a similar open world. Fighting still feels similar to other Zelda titles, however the difficulty of enemies is much higher. The AI is incredibly interesting, they might seem dumb at first but they are so well programmed it will shock you through the whole game. The weapons break and this keeps you searching for new weapons all the time, and also encourages you to be resourceful. Bause of this you use weapons you might other pass up. Boomerangs in this game are amazingly fun. Shield surfing should be in every Zelda from now on. It is the best way to get around in an open world game, ever.There are small frame rate drops in TV mode (not in handheld mode) in areas of thick grass and forest. There arent as many dungeons as I would have hoped, but the 120 shrines make up for this. The bosses dont feel distinct or unique, which has always been a key feature of other zelda games. Rain in this game makes it impossible to do anything almost, and because the rain is so frequent it becomes very inconvenient.These are my only ""cons"" that stand out to me. Overall this is a must play game if you enjoy nintendo, zelda, or open world/adventure games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Like... dang. This game was not made it was crafted. The map is HUGE and impossible but covering every corner, every mountain, every stone or pile of leaves. It's all rewarding. This game encourages you to spend hours climbing and doing nothing productive to the story... and it's still so entertaining. No you're not required to climb that huge cliff in the distance. But... why not?The story and gameplay is still Zelda but the openness of it has you going places you shouldn't be and feeling proud of still accomplishing something in that area. I find myself seeking out towers I shouldn't be near yet. My most victorious moment so far was activating a tower in Hyrule field surrounded by Guardians that will one shot kill you and somehow surviving with a new price of the map - with only 4 hearts.The story is pretty awesome and I can't help but rave at the comparison between you as the player knowing nothing of what's happening and the amesiac Link also knowing nothing. The comparison is even more apparent when searching for memories. As the player you are doing what Link would do.My only ""complaint"" is that weapons go bad QUICK. I'm constantly searching for more swords, bows, etc. But that's just another excuse for me to climb more mountains to search so not big for me.Just wow Nintendo, wow. This is probably the best game you guys ever made. I'm so impressed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"The world is too ‚Äúopen world‚Äù. I think they should leave the open world games to the dozens of other games, and stick to making more of a ‚Äúgame‚Äù and less of a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù.Fighting enemies is pretty fun and feels good (almost feels ""Souls""ish, but after a while I didn‚Äôt even care to engage enemies anymore, as there wasn‚Äôt any benefit. Since there is no XP gained or any drops that are actually beneficial, there‚Äôs really no reason to battle once you‚Äôre past a certain point.Completing shrines became a chore after a while, and many were not very challenging. They really should have reduced the number, and made more ‚Äúdungeons‚Äù, or other random experiences where you could gain an orb.I really miss classic Zelda dungeons.Though the glider and climbing ability are cool , I feel like they caused me to miss a lot of the game. I would just glide and climb everywhere and not really experience much. When I just decided to run everywhere, it was a much more immersive experience.The ‚Äúisland‚Äù was a great surprise and experience.Cooking is super cool. Not having a ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù is not.Using the Wolf Link Amiibo is cool, but it‚Äôs super annoying having to constantly scan it. They should have just built the wolf into the base game. I can‚Äôt believe so many people are never going to even have a wolf pal.Still on the fence about weapons breaking.I‚Äôm amazed at how good this game looks and how big it is, considering how tiny the game card and the Switch system are.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"This is one of those game changer Zelda's. The very original brought changed the way we perceived video games. Ocarina of Time once again did as well. After a few games of the same Zelda format Breath of the Wild really stands out on it's own. Once again it reinvents the Zelda franchise. It's not your typical Zelda game. It's entirely open world and most of the story can go untouched if you don't seek it out. I would say this is a exploration game. It's not linear at all. It's entirely exploration. This world is huge and you'll be doing hours of exploration. The story is rather simple but very interesting since the story tells of how Link lost and this is his redemption. It resembles the first Zelda game where as it's open world, limited story, non linear and many things that you can miss out on. But if you enjoy the Zelda universe I definitely say this is a must play. You could beat the game in any length you want. Play it for 10 hours or 200 hours. The choice is up to you. Fight Ganon right away or explore and build your skills then fight him. Be the legend.And for those whom are giving it a score of 1. No words can explain what's going through your mind.

"I've been playing video games for 28 years. I haven't played a Zelda game since the first two on the NES, and I never had a particular allegiance to either that franchise or to Nintendo in particular. But Breath of the Wild is one of the all time best games across all platforms. I bought a Switch primarily to play Xenoblade 2, and got this because ""Well, I guess it looks pretty cool."" Fast forward a few hours of gameplay, and that synopsis became: ""Oh hey, it's like they took every moment of my childhood spent watching Saturday morning cartoons, added the ability to scale sheer walls and hang-glide, and injected it back into my heart."" If you don't have the adequate memories for gamer nostalgia, grab this game and start making some. The combat is fun, varied, and rewarding; the world is gigantic and alive with wind and weather and light. There's a sense of distance and reasons to explore. There are lots of things to do and lots of ways to do them. There is a full spectrum of moods from tranquil to majestic to intense. Few games come this close to getting everything right. Now of course I can't guarantee that any game is for everyone. If you're a cool kid and you think your friends will tease you if they catch you outside of Dark Souls, by all means, stay away.

"Incredible game‚Ä¶.gameplay for about four weeks and have gotten all the towers and conquered the four beasts and ganon. Impressive problem solving skill challenges, creative and vast. As I go through the game I keep thinking it‚Äôs unbelievable how they developed this game. My kids and I are having a blast going though the shrine challenges and exploring. My 6 year old enjoys walking through the villages, my 9 year old enjoys the shrines and exploring and I go after the main missions. Win-win and enjoyable for everyone.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2022,√âtats-Unis
"We have logged over 80+ hours of playing this game, and still haven‚Äôt ‚Äúbeat‚Äù it. There‚Äôs just sooo much to do! If we wanted we could race to finish it but we have chosen to put it off as long as possible, and still are finding countless things to do, find, make. We constantly are finding new shrines and koroks and missions. Fantastic purchase!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2022,√âtats-Unis
"This is a beautiful game. I have played some of the old Zelda games and didn't really enjoy them too much. I don't generally like action RPGs. This game, though? I love this game. There are often many different ways to tackle any problem and your only limitation is your imagination. It took some time to get used to the controls (might take less time for someone who is more used to fighting games), but they make sense once you do. The worst part of the game is that it uses the button function of the joysticks, so if you apply too much pressure (as you might during an intense fight), you will either crouch or go into scope mode. Obviously, these are both very bad things when you're trying to maneuver around an enemy. Some people complain there are too many shrines. I don't think so. I love the shrines. Each one is a puzzle and though some elements are repeated, I do not feel they are repetitive as each requires you to think about how to use those elements in a new way. I've also seen people complain about the korok seeds, but I don't see how that's a problem? It's a fun little bonus to find and it only helps you by expanding your inventory. If you don't want to go around looking for them, don't. Trust me, you will stumble across plenty as you're exploring.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2018,√âtats-Unis

Regarding Amazon's delivery: The product arrived on time and properly sealed.Regarding the game: Literally a must have. All the hype that you heard about this game? It's true. It's an amazing experience that you'll pour hours and hours of gameplay and still find things to do and explore.I'm honestly amazed by it. It stands high above all switch games in my opinion and it's one of the easiest ways to convince someone to buy the console.You will not regret this purchase,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Though the traditional Zelda formula that has existed since Ocarina of Time is enjoyable, Nintendo's break from convention from this game is a technical masterpiece. There are no limits as to where you go or in what order (besides the level of some enemies in areas, which you can still ignore) and you can spend hours just exploring, foraging for food, doing quests, shrines, etc. I've just beat the game on the 21st and I played at least a few hours every day, but I still didn't complete everything. If you are a Zelda fan, this game is a no brainer, if you're into open world games and haven't played Zelda, this is the perfect one to get started.If you are really wanting to play this on the switch, absolutely get this game, but if you don't have the money just yet and/or waiting for more games to come to the console, either hold out on getting it until Mario Kart comes out or just get it for the Wii U if you already have on.The only critiques I have for this game:-Some frame rate drops here and there-Story could have been fleshed out just a little more-A couple more memorable soundtracksEven with these gripes, they are very minor and are easily overlooked with how good the game is itself. This game has set the bar for future open world games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I have been a huge Zelda fan my entire life, and so I was so disappointed to see any negative reviews for this game. I almost didn't buy it because some people feel so strongly against it. DO NOT LISTEN. I cannot think of even one thing about this game that I don't like. The map is insane (it would take hundreds of hours to see everything), it's beautiful, the puzzles are difficult enough to keep you working but not frustrating enough to quit. Same with the monsters, they're difficult but not so much you feel helpless. I love the fact that you can come at the game from any direction you want, completing whatever you want at any point. It is truly fantastic and I recommend it to long time fans and people who haven't played Zelda alike!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Despite all the hype it is very good. At first I missed the lack of a structured leveling system, but it makes stealth a much more usable form of game-play. You don't have to grind out every enemy you see. In-fact with the limited amount of use you get from a weapon it seems that BOTW encourages avoiding conflict, or high tailing it out of there dropping bombs behind you; running across mountain ridges above the trail to avoid the ambushes... Some of the monsters are brutally difficult, at lest early in the game.Puzzles galore. I've come across some that really allow the freedom to solve creatively with multiple ways to solve. The abundance of wildlife is phenomenal. The game is full of surprises.Also, Link SUCKS at swimming. It is a frustratingly slow pace and he drowns constantly. I kind of wish it kept track of recipes, especially with cooking being such an important part of the game. A cookbook that kept track of things you already made. I suppose I just have to keep an actual journal :(.*spoiler below*Seriously you get the suit that lets you SWIM UP A WATERFALL, but he still doggy paddles at snales pace. WTF Nintendo?Frankly, this game is a system seller. If something of this caliber ever came out for Wii U I probably would have bought one.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"After many years of waiting for Breath of the wild I was finally able to get my hands on a switch and this gem. This was such a fun experience and It has so many hours of juice you can take out of it. Even now I‚Äôm still not done with everything and still have more than 50% to complete. This is definitely a departure of previous Zelda titles. This is an open world masterpiece where you can explore everything and everywhere. There‚Äôs no spaces where there will be empty or fluff, you can explore everywhere. A new addition was the voice acting which was welcomed and I think a great addition. The shrines were so fun and side quests were great and some difficult but for the most part the shrines were a bit easy but enjoyable. Somethings that may need improvement are the weapon system, where your weapons break pretty easily and it becomes frustrating but bearable. Also the bosses felt way too easy and casual to me. Even the final boss seemed extremely easy and maybe should‚Äôve been a bit more challenging. Bottom line, this game is so great and will have you glued to your seat for hours and hours a day. This is by far the best Zelda ever made and I‚Äôm looking forward to more from Nintendo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Playing Zelda: Breath of the Wild was everything it was hyped up to be. The gameplay, graphics, and price was to me, it was all on the mark.9/10 First, the gameplay in this Zelda was crisp and clear, it showed the power that the Nintendo Switch was capable of. The world that I played in was so massive, it is a truly a free world platform. I only wish it played a little like previous Zeldas, but this issue is not a big deal.10/10 Second, the graphics were amazing as well. I hardly saw any error in the frame rate or stability of the graphics. It's amazing the fine detail that was placed in every object in the game. It for sure has the best graphics of any Zelda game to date.10/10 Third, the price was very good for all the time and hardwork that was placed in this game. Taking almost 5 years on one game I know they could have raised the price and people would have still bought Zelda: Breath of the Wild.As a result, I thoroughly enjoyed and still do enjoy this game. I felt they worked hard and gave Zelda fans a great gameplay experience, beautiful graphics, and a price well worth paying. I highly suggest buying this game even if your not a fan.Posted by David Fults",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"When I first booted up the game I thought it was a little slow at first. I was overwhelmed with how big the world looked and didn't play it for a while. After watching some speed runs of the game, I decided to give it another try and oh my God is it amazing. I'm a sucker for open world games and you can climb literally ANYTHING. it felt like I was playing a cartoon version of skyrim, but a little more difficult. I felt nostalgia from this game even though I've never played it before. The quests take you right in and there's some grind to it, but not to where it's annoying or unbearable. The shrines are fun to do and I love the battle mechanics.This game is so good, I'd force my friend to play it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"It is sad but this game is now evil. This game has some spiritualistic undertones for example Demon ruler, god you pray to, spirits, resurrection etc. I can't believe Nintendo ruined this fantasy series by taking it down this path. None of the prior games were like this at all. The thing is none of this was needed to make the game great. The game would have been great had they stuck to Zelda traditions of the triforce and defeating Ganon.Now Ganon is a ""Demon"" and the King (Zelda's father) is a sprit, Link died in a battle long-ago and was resurrected. You gain spirit orbs from evil looking statues and have to pray to some god to gain hearts. I am sure there is worse as  most of this content is revealed shortly after you make initial progress and gain the ""paraglider"".I am saddened Nintendo ruined such a great series by adding all these unneeded spiritualistic themes/content to what is supposed to be a game safe for kids. I expect the sword fighting and fantasy monsters/enemies, but what me and my kids saw was inappropriate for kids - Everything about this game screams evil.All this qualifies as a ""Teen"" game under the suggestive theme content as per below:TEEN""Content is generally suitable for ages 13 and up. May contain violence, suggestive themes, crude humor, minimal blood, simulated gambling and/or infrequent use of strong language.""Had this been a Teen game, many people don't buy it for their kids (like me) and I know Nintendo knew this... I am appalled at this oversight by the ESRB (look at their game description) and Nintendo hiding this content....As it stands both my kids ask me about the game being evil....You have all been warned.As for content, I figured I give those who don't care about the spiritualistic side something to think about:1. This game has not been polished, there are technical issues/glitches and gameplay frustrations that show poor quality control. For example, you are given meaningless tasks that are intended as filler for time such as having to create a specific dish and figure out the last ingredient required from your 1 million food items picked up. It gets better though, one of the ingredients for that dish you can only get by hunting an animal that produces two steaks per kill. The best part is there is only one animal (Bison?) that shows up in one location randomly which is fairly large and you have to explore to find (because that is totally realistic that only one would appear). The point is the task is made a difficult as possible and fills like a plot to get you to waste time.It gets better, some mountains that you can climb up you will randomly fall off from even if you still have stamina. Also, the bisons I spoke of earlier (that you must hunt) will disappear if chased even in an open field (enemies will also stop following after a while). All these screams poor game design.2. These random tasks get become frustrating as you have to figure out things on your own with very minimal hints. I suspect a group of people will get bored and stop playing here.3. The dungeons take like 5 minutes to compete and don't have more than one basic puzzle to solve. It is actually more difficult to find the dungeons than to spend the 5 minutes to clear them.4. The combat is basic and you will not die fighting until you fight some mini-boss type of character in the open field that kills you with one hit, of course since enemies have no intelligence, the game would be too easy without this cheapness.5. While supposedly a huge game there is very little to directly interact with that serves any gameplay purpose other than to waste time - the producers of the games could have focused development on the inhabitants of this world rather than making everything so random.Now you can decide if this game is worth your money based on these issues.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"My family is now addicted to Zelda, we are rotating shifts on the couch. The older ones get the swing shift. Hunting, gathering and riding the horses are my favorite. I sometimes wake up in the middle of the night only to find our 12year old red-eyed and glued to the game like a mindless zombie. You know its bad when our 2 year old knows when the blood moon is coming...my other half never plays video games but we hooked him, when he plays he looks like a teenage kid from back in the day that moves his whole body when he is fighting a bad guy while starring intensely at the screen. Our kids get angry at anyone who walks in front of the tv, sometimes yelling profanities at us. I'm thinking of joining a zelda anonymous group or having some type of family intervention...I sometimes wake up screaming, ""Link!Link!"" And wake up to Jake making the horse sidestep up the hills with the horse and laughing. I love cooking too, I'm making a cake right now with a dragon scale for unlimited hearts. The house is starting to smell because nobody wants to bathe anymore and we practice our fight moves while drinking elixsirs our 5 year old has prepared (usually consisting of beetles, mighty bananas and tree moss).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Este es el Zelda mas grande y ambicioso que hemos visto hasta el momento.Esta entrega en la franquicia se separa bastante de la formula tradicional. En este juego nos encontramos en un mundo abierto fisicamente mas grande que hemos visto en la saga. En esta ocasion, la formula de avanzar por templos en un orden especifico, fue arrojada por la ventana, y desde el inicio somos libres de decidir en que orden vamos a hacer las cosas, inclusive puedes ir directo al enemigo final sin preparaci√≥n si asi lo deseas, aunque seguramente perderas tragicamente.Este juego esta plagado de cosas que hacer, lugares que visitar, vistas para apreciar, cosas por coleccionar , y personajes completamente encantadores por conocer.El gameplay es mas tradicional a los juegos de accion que conocemos, pero por primera vez en la serie tenemos un sistema de administraci√≥n de armas y equipamento. Las espadas , escudos, y arcos, todas tienen un limite de usos, pues se desgastan y se terminan rompiendo. Esto es muy frequente, pero sera muy dificil encontrarse en una situaci√≥n donde no tengas opciones para recolectar armas para su uso en otra ocasion.Las misiones secundarias son muy entretenidas, y los peque√±os Santuarios nos presentan con algunos de los Puzzles mas creativos que la serie ha engendrado hasta el momento.La historia del juego deja un poco que desear, pero el viaje hasta el final es lo que hace esta entrega algo bastante especial.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,6,2017,Mexique

"Having fully played through the entrire game, i can say it was truly fantastic. It is a beautifully crafted world and filled with tons of content to enjoy. It is filled with some great detail, with each area of this open world, having some meaning or use. You will find yourself doing numerous side quests for fun and finding intriguing and challenging puzzles and enemies to test . it feels as though it is a unique artstyle as many games take a modern approach to games in terms of realistic graphics, so this is a welcome differentiation. Whilst there is a story in this game, it  However the story is quite nice to see and the cutscenes are fully voiced,About 2 hours later and I was in love with the best game I've played, certainly in a generation, probably ever.

"Been playing Nintendo since as long as I remember (NES days). Never had interest in Zelda - much more into platformers and sports games. Was told by my high school students I simply had to buck up and play. I did use a guide in many places to know where to go, but also figured a lot out on my own. Very cool. Reminded me a lot of Skyrim, which I played tons of hours on and have never even come close to half the story. I feel like I could still be running through BOTW aimlessly having fun, if not for the guide.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,9,2021,√âtats-Unis

"I've been playing The Legend of Zelda games since I was a kid.  And this is by far one of the best games I've ever played.The open world concept is great.  The million different ways to accomplish something. The extras. All of it is great.Three things I didn't really like about this game compared to other Zelda games...1. The camera angles are HORRIBLE.  I don't know how many times I had a hard time seeing something.  It actually hurt my neck cause I felt like I needed to look up at something as well.2. The crouch button.  I don't know how many times I got killed because I was in a tense part of the game and accidently held the left analog stick too hard.3. The story.  I know the first few Zelda games didn't really have a story.  But one thing I liked about games like Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess is you felt a great connection to all of the characters.  This is not the same in BOTW.  I cna't even remember the names of half the main characters off the top of my head.Overall, PLAY THIS GAME.  It's amazing.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Presumably you‚Äôre a parent or grandparent buying this for a kid (because if you were a kid you‚Äôd already know this), so this is easy...if the kid has a Nintendo Switch, and they don‚Äôt have this game yet (and make sure, because there‚Äôs more than one ‚ÄúZelda‚Äù game for the Switch‚Äîthis is ‚ÄúBreath of the Wild‚Äù sometimes abbreviated ‚ÄúBOTW‚Äù‚Äîthen just get it, they‚Äôll love it.  Most people agree it‚Äôs one of the top games not of just the year, or the decade or of its genre, but of all time‚Äî-and I mean back to Pong.  Note it is very much a single player game, although it‚Äôs so entertaining that one sibling may get sucked into watching another play for a while.

Now, after completing the game, that statement is 100%. This was one of the first games I got for my Switch and I almost wish I had waited to play because every other game is so mediocre compared to BOTW.If you‚Äôre anything like me and have never played Zelda, don‚Äôt worry about feeling like you‚Äôre missing something. This game doesn‚Äôt rely on storylines from other versions.My personal favorite part of this game was the lore, symbolism, and spiritual aspects.

"Real great openworld exploration with crafting, fishing, forraging, and hunting. Combat feels good. Then your weapon breaks after 5 hits and you have to wheel to another or use your social abilities real creatively. Kinda a crap Zelda game, but the world and the story are too great to ignore. Not your traditional dungeon crawler.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Breath of the Wild will throw you off your zelda game a bit.  It maintains the puzzles and adventure of the old style while adding much much more and changing a great deal as well.  I noticed that the game is a lot more about strategy than the previous where one could rush into battle against any enemy and usually live.  The world is massive and incredible to explore and the characters and stories add a wonderful life to the entire game.  The music is often soft and sometimes only the sound of the world can be heard which is a refreshing change from that of other games.  I, having played and owning every Zelda game to date, find Breath of the Wild to be my new favorite for adventure.Those of you who enjoy the structure of dungeon after dungeon will be disappointed as Breath of the Wild does not follow this pattern and can be accomplished in any order or even without completing some portions.  It is the player's responsibility to decide if he or she would like to find out more background to the story or simply destroy evil.  Also, there are a great deal of side quests, making this game similar to the elder scrolls series.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is probably one of the best Zelda games ever, I regret nothing! Sure, some (very few) people would argue the opposite. But bear with me:This game has hours, and I say HOURS of gameplay, I have about 120 hrs played by the time I write this review and I haven't even explored half the map. It has amazing scenery, likable and relatable characters, a powerful story and a lot of easter eggs and side quests. I do, however, agree that the weapon system is quite frustrating in the first few hours of gameplay, but once you start getting the hang of it it's not a hassle anymore.So, if you're a completionist, or you've got ADD like me, this is going to be a long journey because you will get lost just goofing around, or exploring and climbing and trying to get to every little corner in this game's vast world. So if you want a lot of frenetic action or a fast-paced game this is probably not a game for you, and probably not any Zelda game for that matter... You could try to go to fight Ganon right away and see how you do, I believe some frenetic action would be in place lol.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
This game bored me at first i did not see it. Once i got out of the starting area with more bad guys and fun locations i got hooked! I love riding my horse and finding new places to explore. The loot from chests through is the only negative i can say about this game. I wish it was more cooler wow a new tiny bit better weapon or whatever. I want more stuff like hard to find perm weapons that do not break and outfits and other cool rewards maybe horse armor lol. I hope the next one they make the chests feel real special finding them. I like hunting and finding stuff like that. The rest of the game ohhhh so good so far and best game on switch i played so far. Must own!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"This game is everything I never knew I always wanted in a Zelda game. Sure, the basic plot (play as Link, save Hyrule/the princess, defeat Ganon) is still in pristine condition, well preserved since the series' inception in the 80s despite multiple uses. But the execution in Breath of the Wild is so different from any of the other console Zelda games that it's easy to forget that you're playing the same plot points, and fighting the same main boss, for the umpteenth time. This game is exactly what the franchise needed.For the record, I haven't had any fps or other frame issues playing on the Switch, at least not that are noticeable or impede gameplay. It runs beautiful on my tv (midsize, LG) and the music is lovely.The only complaint I have about this game so far is the text. It's awfully small in places (like item descriptions) with no options to enlarge it. It also shows as a fairly bright white on mostly dark backgrounds, and I had trouble reading it from where I usually sit in my room (about 10-12 feet from the tv) so I had to move closer (to about 6 feet away) to really feel like I was able to read and enjoy the game fully.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Breath of the Wild is in strong contention for my favorite video game of all time, regardless of platform or genre. The artistic style is minimalist perfection. The music will calm you and stress you right out within a few seconds (I listen to the former to help me focus at work). You can spend hundreds of hours collecting every korok ""seed"" or finish the game in...I dunno, maybe 20-30 hours, if focusing on the primary story. Mastering Lynel combat is daunting yet satisfying. Riding horses is just as good as it was in Ocarina of Time. The variety of landscapes, the pure expanse of the map, is truly amazing.

"I can't say enough good things about Breath of the Wild. I've loved games for a long time, but the Zelda series was never too interesting to me. They were always more charm than good, but this one has drawn me in in an incredible way. More than 50 hours of game time in, and I haven't yet come close to completing my time in it. It's as engaging for me as it is for my girlfriend who is not nearly as well-versed in games as I am, and for her two kids, ages 6 and 10. It's a family obsession right now and to me, that's well worth the cost of Switch (especially once Mario Kart 8 and Mario Odyssey are out)!The way the game's systems interact in the world means everybody plays a little differently, and it's been incredible to see how we all approach it differently. It's incredibly striking, visually, and the gameplay is as deep and fun as you want it to be.There are some small annoyances related to inventory management and weapon degradation, but I don't think they hinder the game much.If you've ever been interested in playing games, play this.

"With past successes like Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker I thought no way could they make a new game in the Zelda series to top those. Boy, was I wrong! This game turned the series on its head and reinvented the whole formula and I couldn't be happier! This game is perfection. I went into it with relatively modest expectations as I just didn't know how well Zelda would mesh with a true open world ""do anything, anywhere"" kind of formula. Yes they've tried that with the original Zelda but it's never been done on this scale. I tend to get overwhelmed by open world games just because of the massive scale but I never once felt the world was too big. If anything I was excited to keep exploring and see EVERYTHING the game had to offer. There are a LOT of things to explore and collect in this game. Being that the game is just a massive shift in the Zelda formula, it does ditch a few key things like traditional dungeon design and accumulating items, while adding in things like cooking for survival. But as the game is I wouldn't change a thing. It could be the most perfect game Nintendo has ever released.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I bought my boyfriend a Switch for his birthday, but held off on buying this game to see if he actually wanted it. We're both really big gamers and own every console, but neither of us was ever into Zelda games until now. I started to watch him play not thinking I would have any interest in playing myself, but now I can't put it down! This game reminds me of a combination of different games (Skyrim, Jak and Daxter, and others), all of which are among my favorites. I absolutely love open world games, it gives you the freedom to explore wherever you like, which is half the fun of this game! The combat is pretty different than most games, weapons break fairly often which can be irritating, but there are some that have incredibly strong durability. I play this game whenever I can; in the mornings before work, when I get home from work, and all throughout the weekend. And I love that I can go from the TV to the handheld in seconds! There isn't one thing I dislike about this game, except the fact that my boyfriend and I argue over whose turn it is to play :P. Might have to get a second console and second game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I absolutely love this game, it's visually appealing and the gameplay is wonderful. There's lots to do and just that right amount of difficulty. Probably one of the best Zelda games out there and I can't wait for the sequel to BOTW!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2022,√âtats-Unis

"If you are a Zelda fan and/or a fan of Western RPG's like the Elder Scrolls series (for example) then you will LOVE this game. Hundreds of hours can be spent playing this game and exploring the VAST map that this game touts. Like nothing else the Zelda series have ever seen and that's all before the DLC that will be released later this year.Gameplay and the story is largely engrossing. You won't want to turn off your Nintendo Switch and you will be glad you purchased one if for nothing else than for the ability to play this game...but don't sleep, there's TONS of great Nintendo 1st party titles on the horizon that Nintendo fans will WANT TO PLAY!Back to Zelda though, the atmosphere, graphics, sound and gameplay are all SPOT ON. There's crafting of Food, Potions, Weapons and Armor as well as a bunch of quests, side quests and tons of hidden content to keep you engrossed for at least the next several months... The Game of the Year buzz that this game has received is 100% deserved. Get this game! You will LOVE It!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Soy fan de la antigua f√≥rmula de Zelda, me encanta su forma lineal de ir venciendo jefes, obteniendo los √≠tems de cada mazmorra e ir creciendo con la historia; cabe mencionar q no me gustan los juegos de mundo abierto ya q en muchas ocasiones te aburres de no hacer algo.Cuando me enter√© q iban a cambiar la f√≥rmula pens√© q la esencia de Zelda hab√≠a muerto, pero q equivocado estaba, es cierto, se extra√±a los grandes templos y un poco m√°s de historia pero este Zelda lo compensa con arte y estrategia, cabalgar sin rumbo fijo, escalar una monta√±a para averiguar q hay arriba, realizar las misiones secundarias, etc., es un deleite y te vas a pasar horas y horas jugando, estoy seguro.El mapa es gigantesco y puedes hacer lo q se te de la gana.Yo lo tengo para Wii U, pero jugar en donde sea en el Switch va a ser un verdadero deleite.Y no crean en las opiniones q dicen q solo dura hora y media, si siguen la historia es muy largo y si te vas a enfrentar al jefe final desde el principio mucha suerte y a√∫n as√≠ hora y media es muuuuuuuuuuuyyyyyyyyyy poco.Es un t√≠tulo q debes de tener en el Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,5,2018,Mexique
"To be honest, while I have much respect and admiration for the Zelda series of video games, I have never truly had that moment with a previous entry in the series where I felt compelled to immerse myself in the game and finish it up to completion.  Before Breath of the Wild, the bulk of my experience with the LoZ series came from Link's Awakening on the original Game Boy.With that being said, those who feel right at home with open world games, where exploration takes a central role in the adventure, will feel at home with the latest entry in the Zelda franchise.  It never feels too overwhelming, which is a good thing because this entry introduces a lot of new elements that players of previous Zelda games have never encountered in this franchise before.  It is a stunningly beautiful game, one that is meant to be explored at one's own pace.  Similar to Skyrim and other open world games, the main quest can be ignored and completed at one's leisure.  There are plenty of areas to explore, tons of secrets and hidden things to find, and loads of side quests to take on and solve.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This game offers an excellent sense of exploration and a huge interactive world to explore. Unlike any other games that I have played that mostly sell themselves on exploring an open world, locations and regions in Zelda feel alive, interesting, and carefully designed.  The game does an excellent job of rewarding exploration and making the world field infinitely interactive. This game has an odd difficulty curve and the non-linear story due to the way the game was made so that you can do anything in any order you choose, but to me these are not negatives. Everything about this game gives you a sense of first danger, then wonder, then  a success as you grow more  a powerful. The leveling system feels very natural, and I personally like the way that weapon durability encourages you to strategize and switch up your weapons frequently. Great NPC interactions, enemies, and hundreds and hundreds of both open-world and closed puzzles to discover and solve. The sandbox nature means you can play forever if you wanted, but after over 100 hours of play I may be bringing my time with Breath of the Wild to a close. However, it has been an immensely memorable and enjoyable time discovering the world of Hyrule.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is the single greatest video game of all time. I've never been one to get lost in a video game for hours but this game has it all.  You don't have to go in any order and can explore for hours at a time discovering all kinds of things for you. Can't wait for BotW 2 to come.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
"It might be worth getting the switch for Zelda alone. This game redefines open world games, redefines zelda and recreated the sense of discovery that old school games used to have while implementing a ton of modern ideas better than any other modern open world title on the market. You can't go back to games like Skyrim after this, Nintendo outdid Bethesda in every way in terms of worldbuilding, exploration and just capturing the pure fun of discovery that Morrowind had but Oblivion and Skyrim crushed.You'll want to talk to nearly everyone you see in this game, characters are almost always interesting and the game's sense of humor is very reminiscent of older 3D Zelda titles. This is also in contrast to western open world titles like Skyrim where seemingly every character is bland and a chore to talk to.If I were to pick out a few flaws; the frame rate sometimes drops in docked mode, some of the shrines are significantly weaker than others, and I could've used a bit more music - especially in the shrines where there's only one music track. These are relatively minor issues in what is undoubtedly the best Zelda in years, possibly the best Zelda of all time...it completely shattered my expectations",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I grew up with a NES in the 80s, then had Ocorina of Time for the N64 (still one of my all time favorites) and now my 8 year old has found his own passion for these games.  He really enjoys this and the remake of Link's Awakening on his Switch",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,1,2022,√âtats-Unis
"I remember years ago when the Wii first came out.  Nintendo basically said, ""Let Sony and Microsoft go at it with the big graphic games, we're going to do something different.""  I was a bit skeptical, but they seemed to own the cartoonish look of their games, and just made games that were fun and engaging and I was impressed.  I've tried sticking with Nintendo since, but I'm starting to find that they're being outpaced in such a big way now.  Playing any open world game on another console and you have big, expansive worlds; graphics that are great; in-depth environments; and fun game-play.For example, I recently finished Assassin's Creed Origins and am now playing Far Cry 5.  Not only are the environments that Ubisoft makes just plain beautiful, they're fun.  I've only played a few hours of Far Cry so far, but I've ridden a ATV through a forest, taken a speedboat down a river, ridden in a helicopter, explored several unique buildings, come across several surprises in the forest, and had some fun gun battles.In contrast, BOTW I've played for several hours.  What have I done?  I've gotten some melee weapons and had some ho-hum battles swinging at enemies.  I've spent a large part of my gaming time in the menus equipping weapons that (for some strange reason) constantly break and need to be collected and re-equipped.  I've explored some comparatively unremarkable environments, and cooked some items I gathered.  And I've died a lot because of the crazy fatigue system built into the game.  Fall off a cliff near water or swim just a little too far and you die.  Oh, and don't let it rain in the game if you want to climb.  Rain makes you slip, and if you're in an area where you need to climb, you're basically just stuck until the rain stops.  A lot of the game-play seems clunky.  Riding on a horse, battling on a horse, or even having a battle just seem un-intuitive.I'll try with almost any game, but I fell like I've given this one a fair try and it's just not grabbing my attention.  I feel like I'm just wandering around aimlessly and when I find a challenge it's kind of a grind more than a thrill ride.If I had to say some positives, I'd say that it's nostalgic feeling, if you like puzzle games the shrines offer some nice mini-games, and obviously if you're traveling then you can play an open world game to pass the time.Still, if I compare this game to games like Witcher, Skyrim, or any big open world game it feels almost childish in a way, and maybe that's what I don't like about it.  Maybe Nintendo is just meant more for little kids than adults and it's time for me to let it go.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I never expected to be so hooked to this game. I'm enamoured with the world and the freedom they give. I've had over 30 hours and haven't even done the main storyline as yet. Exploring is not the means, it is the objective.Every review I've read or friend I've spoken to me does not do Botw justice. The greatest thing about this game is that you can play it however you want to. Your experience will not be my experience and vice versa.This game stands out like Ocarina of Time did for the N64. Undisputedly the best game of that year, one of the best of that period and a masterstroke by Nintendo because they pushed the boundaries of what's possible in the medium. Every other game I've played since feels like a tiny box because of Botw.Get it, play it and see for yourself.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"From the moment I saw the graphics, I was smitten with this game. This world is full of beautiful, vibrant colors and captivating designs. It's eye-catching visuals are quick to draw you in.Along with the gorgeous world, the gameplay is exciting. Battles are difficult and you need proper equipment. You constantly have to collect items to keep going, including weapons which break after too much use. It is not tedious at all, but fun as you find new things to keep you alive throughout the map. You may find a sword charged with the power of lightning, or a shield with extra strength to block incoming attacks.The storyline and unique characters are sure to keep your interest as you travel, meeting various races like the Ruto and the Zoras. Every bit of your travels are at your whim. You go where you want to, when you want to, only restricted by your skills and the items you have.Without a doubt, I consider the game a must for anyone who owns a Nintendo Switch. If you're anything like me, you will put hours into finding out everything you can about the land of Hyrule.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2018,√âtats-Unis

"This game is one of my top ten favorite games of all time. Everything from the story, game physics, music and characters will be you away. I do have to say that the weapon durability can feel a little tedious at times. You'll often have to find new weapons to get. I also did find that the game got too easy once you make a lot of progress. Although overall, it's a must have game. It takes open world to the next level with the game physics.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,9,2021,√âtats-Unis

"This game is terrible for a number of reasons:1.  This game makes me tired.  I can't get any sleep anymore because I'd rather be climbing these endless mountains looking for secrets.2.  It makes my small children complain. I guess they ""don't know how to make their own dinner"" yet.3.  It makes my days off from work disappear.  I swear I had a bunch of days off before I got this game, and now I have next to nothing.4.  It makes my home business suffer.  What would you rather have: some extra cash that you're just going to spend on eating out, or a bunch of cool weapons and gear to help you rescue a princess?5.  It makes me fat.  After running at night with my stealth gear and and hasty elixir or soaring off of cliffs with a hang glider, running around the block seems so boring.I have not seen any evidence that these problems are going away any time soon.  I have played for hours and hours, and as far as I can tell, I have not even scratched the surface of what this game has to offer.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Es un excelente juego en general, la historia tal ves no es muy interesante y en general pasa a segundo termino, lo mejor del juego es el mundo abierto, sin duda uno de los mejores juegos con este estilo. Es un juego complicado al principio, principalmente si uno no esta acostumbrado a este tipo de juegos, la curva de aprendizaje es algo lento pero cuando se le entiende a la mec√°nica del juego, es un juego bastante disfrutable.  Su mundo abierto lo convierte tal ves en el mejor juego para esta consola.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2021,Mexique

"Este juego se volvi√≥ no solo mi Zelda Favorito, sino uno de mis videojuegos favoritos de todos los tiempos. El mundo que nos presenta es inmenso, Hermoso visualmente, con climas que afectan las cosas que puedes realizar, lleno de actividades y personajes variopintos. Ademas, uno tiene la completa libertad para ocupar su tiempo como mejor le parezca. Las misiones secundarias son entretenidas de hacer, el buscar los santuarios y los kolog se vuelve casi una necesidad autoimpuesta y el combate premia la experimentaci√≥n. Aunque la historia es la de un Zelda clasico, tiene sus puntos interesantes y los personajes que la componen tienen mucho carisma y dif√≠cilmente no te vas a  encari√±ar con alguno.En Fin, es un juegazo. SI a estas fechas aun no lo has jugado y tienes una Switch, no s√© que estas esperando. Vale absolutamente cada centavo, tanto en duraci√≥n, como en calidad de Gameplay.

"Un gran cambio para la serie, en su mayor parte para mejor, es muy entretenido explorar, pr√°cticamente todo lo que se ve en el horizonte es posible explorarlo con el equipo y upgrades adecuados, hay todo tipo de mazmorras y cuevas escondidas y un sin de monta√±as a escalar.El armamento es vasto, al igual que los diferentes tipos de armaduras  con diferentes funciones y estas √∫ltimas es posible reforzarlas en las fuente de hada.No obstante, las armas no son duraderas y no hay forma de repararlas (excepto aquellas relacionadas con el plot), hay sistema de crafting pero es limitado a cocinar alimentos curativos y hacer posiciones que rara vez realmente se usan.Otro factor es que ya no hay calabozos con √≠tems especiales, todo lo que vas a necesitar se te da en la zona tutorial, y el resto se las mazmorras son peque√±as con un par de puzzle a veces ingeniosos y solo dan Orbes de Coraje que sirven ya sea para aumentar los corazones o stamina (la cual se usa para escalar, nadar, planear y ataques especiales), y si acaso alg√∫n tesoro con alg√∫n arma, los calabozos grandes pr√°cticamente no existen en esta entrega.El combate en s√≠ es adecuado, pero nada muy especial se limita sobre todo a esquivar a tiempo y golpear con el arma; eso s√≠, este Link es probablemente uno de los m√°s d√©bil casi cualquier golpe lo manda a volar y le roba 4 corazones.Con todo es gran un juego, pero no perfecto, es algo que podr√≠a pulirse m√°s en pr√≥ximas entregas",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,12,2017,Mexique

Pero este juego es una excepci√≥n, el juego te puede entretener por bastantes horas, es ese tipo de juegos que cuando los llevas jugando como por 3 horas, sientes que fue menos.Se los recomiendo, se va poniendo m√°s dificil, eso si. Pero no quita el hecho de que puedes llevarte horas por buscar por todo Hyrule para buscar materiales de comida y poder aguantar contra ciertos enemigos, pelear contra los climas, etc. Sin duda, si tienes Switch es un juego obligatorio que debes comprar pese que ya tiene poco m√°s de dos a√±os de su lanzamiento :)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,12,2019,Mexique

"You start off this game as clueless, weak, and scared. After a hundred hours of collecting weapons, increasing your health and stamina, concocting hearty dishes, and practicing your parries and bowmanship, you emerge as a hero of Hyrule. But really you will spend most of that time exploring what is over the next hill, being surprised by monsters, and uncovering secrets. This is a game where you don‚Äôt need to follow a scripted path but can set out in any direction you choose. If there is one caveat, I definitely recommend looking up Hestu‚Äôs location because it is easy to miss him and without finding him you will not be able to upgrade your inventory slots to be able to hold enough cool weapons. If you have a Switch, you need to invest the money and get this game. It‚Äôs one of the greatest gaming experiences out there.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,2,2020,√âtats-Unis

You need to play this game as soon as possible.For perspective, I am in my mid 30s and grew up with Nintendo products in my life including the Zelda series. No other game game has felt so open, so immersive, so engaging. Maybe it‚Äôs the nostalgia speaking, but I am blown away so far. Right now I am only 60 hours into the game but I still have a significant amount of the story still to go. I have spent the majority of my time just exploring the landscape and what hides inside each cave or on top of each mountain. Even my kids, 7 and 10 each have about 10-15 hours in the game. I can easily see 150 hours of gameplay before the extended content. I am extremely happy with this game so far.If you are lucky enough to have found a switch and you don‚Äôt have this game.

"I do not have a long history of playing zelda, actually much of nintendo actually.  The first game I bought for my switch was lego city undercover because I was interested it the game regardless of the platform it was on.  I went and purchased Zelda in part due to a lack of games for the switch, and because it was an open world action adventure.Presentation:  I think the game is very attractive, do not really see any flaws and it runs well.  My issue is with everything else.  There is not much music and not much of it is memorable.  Not many spoken lines with mostly reading which I am normally fine with but with all the high praise I thought this game would have more spoken lines.  Sound effects are fine.Gameplay:  Is solid with all the buttons being used for different actions and a lot of different ways to conquer an opponent.  I don‚Äôt feel like the game does a lot unique but the package is tight and the animations smooth.  The land is pretty barren overall so that is why the draw distance is really good because not much to render.  I can‚Äôt stand the weapon mechanic with them always breaking.  I don‚Äôt mind weapon breaking over time but when you are in a short fight with 1 enemy and it barely last then getting a new weapon does not bring much excitement.  There are also a great many fetch quest that seem to only lengthening the game than add any depth to it.Conclusion:  I like the story, although not told in a deep way, It is a good one that gives you purpose.  The game is overrated to me as I see this as an 80-85 type of game.  There is just nothing that is outstanding about this game. I feel it is solid but with the weapon breaking, fairly empty world, boring fetch quests and what you have is a good game not amazing at all.Update: After playing it for a bit I realized I'm not having much fun.  I start to see this game as a justification to enjoy the switch, like I was pushing myself to play it. What really decided it for me though was playing Horizon Zero Dawn and having a blast and then trying to come back to Zelda.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,8,2017,√âtats-Unis

"If you never played Zelda series before, you are just like me.I could read all the reviews and still be in doubt if I should buy this game or not, because all of them seems to be coming from Zelda fans.So, consider these humble points:- First, Zelda is not the main character with the sword. Probably you already know this.- If you don't like open giant worlds with sidequests and feel confused about it you shouldn't buy the game, otherwise go ahead.- The game is suitable for kids and grown up kids (like me)- If you like stunning amazing arts, really, take this even if you don't like games. Play it in a friend's Switch in this case.- You will see some physics like wind carrying your things and spreading the fire. Similar in the real world when you leave money next to the window.- If you don't have much time to sleep, properly schedule your activities. Sleeping 3 or 4 times a week should be enough.- For real now, I loved it. You don't need to know previous story to play, you just need to be looking for fun.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I  bought this for my kids because of the great memory I had playing Zelda 2 when I was a kid.  That was one of the most challenging and rewarding games I had ever finished.  I've not played video games for over 25 years until getting the switch and BOTW.  I am amazed at how much gaming has improved and how much I've missed out!  I like that this game is not all about fighting and is not too violent and gruesome.  The game is fun for all ages and even my youngest 5 year old boy enjoys playing it, although he mostly just explores the villages and experiment with cooking.  The biggest problem with this game is that it is so addictive that we'll play it all day and don't want to do anything else. So my wife is not too happy.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,7,2017,√âtats-Unis

I would like to talk about the pros and cons for Zelda Breath of the Wild.ProsWhen you die (and you will) you won‚Äôt loose all of your stuff.Lots of fun boss fightsA variety of equipment to earnOpen world means lots to exploreWorks well with the handheld or dockConsa lot of reading is confusing at firstopen world also means you may get lostYou have to put in a lots of hours to progressI highly recommend this game because it is fun to play when you‚Äôre not playing online with friends.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Una maravilla de juego, espere mucho tiempo para jugarlo y la verdad es un grandioso juego, los santuarios son lo m√°s divertido ya que en algunos tienes peleas, si no eres seguidor de la saga y es tu primer juego de Zelda, la verdad te gustar√°, es dif√≠cil pero la dificultad vale la pena, a√∫n no termino el juego y espero tardar m√°s en terminarlo ya que disfruto mucho jugando el t√≠tulo, la libertad que te dan en el mapa es lo mejor de todo",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,7,2021,Mexique
"This game is MUST have if you‚Äôre a Switch owner. First played it back in 2019 experiencing a Zelda game for the first time and I was simply blown away. There‚Äôs so much to do in this game. If you‚Äôre into games that let you do a lot of exploring/fighting/doing side quest/solving puzzles/collecting items/etc this game is definitely for you. I put in about 160 hours and was never bored once. Hands down one of my favorite games ever. If you haven‚Äôt played it by now, I definitely recommend picking it up. It‚Äôs worth every dime & your time",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I've basically played this every single day since I got it. It is addictive and there is so much to explore in the game. The map is huge and even after you have unlocked the whole map, there are tons of things to find and do throughout Hyrule. My husband and I take turns playing, it really is great for any level of gamer. My husband has never played any Zelda game before (more of an FPS guy) and I played almost all of them since the original Legend of Zelda on Nintendo's first console. It's a great game and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun game that gives you plenty to do and customize without being as complicated as something like Elder Scrolls.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
No issue's. I did check and open this game up to see if the game was inside the case and yes it was. Because this was going to my son as a Christmas gift I wanted to ensure the game was in it. Because of all the reviews I was seeing that the game wasn't in there I had to check and ensure it was. Now with people missing their games I do know that inside packing facilities and warehouse many of the worker's steal. So that could be why your game wasn't in it. But mine was in the case so I have No complaints.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2021,√âtats-Unis

"I purchased this game for my grown son. We are both huge LoZ fans. I asked him for his thoughts. Here's his review:""See an important destination on the horizon, set off to reach it, climb a mountain on the way and find something really cool at the top. From the top of the mountain see 3 other mountains with 3 other cool things at the top. Set off to find all of those really cool things and all of the really cool things beyond them, and arrive at your original destination 50 hours later.You get out what you put into it. If your skilled enough you can march straight to the final boss and be done in 5 hours. If you need to better prepare for the final boss or just want to let your will to explore guide you you'll get lost for hundreds of hours and still find new things even at the 200 hundred hour mark.I'm a big fan of previous 3D Zelda games but those games feel like truncated and abstract representations of the adventure that Breath of the Wild provides.""",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

"My second go at a Zelda game and this was a way better experience by far.This open world that Breath of the Wild provided I feared would have been too overwhelming just at the thought and fear of becoming lost with no way of ever thinking I could finish the game.I become confused until I learned the importance of recipes and cooking.I would definitely recommend a guide book or a youtube video once in a whileBut by far it has been awesome I played 2 weeks straight and racked up 35 hours of play time.So it is safe to say I love this experience.With puzzles and different enemies with different way you can get the results you are looking for, you experience is entirely up to  you.If you become stuck on something, try a different area on the map and you will become occupied once again.This game shows how much love and care went into the design to appeal to just about anyone.Do try it if you have the opportunity",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
"BOTW is an amazing first party title, reflective of the general quality of Nintendo studios. I compare this to Skyrim because it really reflects the thoroughly engrossing and mystifying nature of Skyrim. Where you can set out to get something done. Get distracted by something going on and just run off; hours later you realize you never got your original goal done. The world is lovely, immersive and vibrant.The only major complaint I have is the design decision around weapons breaking. I just don't care for it. Otherwise a nigh-perfect experience.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
I'm 45 and I love to play video games.  I have played this and it is still one of my top favorite video games.  My 8 year old boy plays this every day and plays it again and again.  My 5 year old son likes to play it as well when my 8 year old is at school.  I try to play it when the kids are all at school and when I am not playing minecraft.  We enjoy it tremendously and can't wait to get the new one for Christmas and play that.  Highly recommended for the entire family.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Love Zelda, Breath Of The Wild! If I bought no other game for my switch, this game would have made the Nintendo Switch worth the purchase! Without cheating, my husband, I & the grandkids played this for 6 months before anyone defeated the game. My husband after winning created a new character & he has started all over.As a school teacher, grandmother I highly recommend this! Pros: There are clues, strategies, create your own path, challenges without directions, and context clues, overcoming adversity. School gives all the answers - kids need to think there way through things. This game is you & a character (great team).  Cons- time consuming - great during this corona virus! Enjoy!!! We also bought Mario Kart, not as time consuming.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,4,2020,√âtats-Unis

"I had to convince my daughter to let me get this game for her. She has said ""thank you"" to me so many times for talking her into it that it's kinda funny now. She has played every Legend of Zelda, except perhaps the very first, which her dad and I played like crazy. She has spent hours cackling madly over the game, reveling in the mechanics, the story, and playing Link again. She's given us running commentary on the best horse, why it's as good or better than other LoZ games, etc. Ocarina of Time has been her favorite until now, and it's having a run for its money with the sheer size of the world in Breath of the Wild giving it an edge. I'm afraid Ocarina of Time may be falling from it's pedestal. This game is worth every penny twice over at least.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I tried, and tried, and tried ... I've put in maybe 30 hours to date, and I've gotten basically nowhere. And I don't really feel like moving on at this point.This is a huge, HUGE game. I've explored maybe 10%. The graphics are excellent, the soundtrack is great if a bit minimalist. It's big, it's WIDE open, and it's super-involved. Weapons break on you. Stocks of ammunition (i.e. arrows) run out. If you want to eat, you need to collect and then cook your food. If you want to cook your food you need to find yourself some fire. And on, and on.Big, open, involved -- all of these are probably plusses for a lot of gamers, and this game has certainly received its fair share of great reviews. But here's the thing: I'm an adult, with a real life and responsibilities. And every time I sit down in front of this game I spend two or three hours collecting supplies and cooking food and fighting various monsters, all without making much progress. Why bother?!Breath of the Wild, maybe it's not you. Maybe it's me. But you're no Link Between Worlds. You're certainly no Ocarina of Time. You feel like a big mess of a game that just doesn't quite come together and, as phrased so brilliantly by Sweet Brown, ain't nobody got time for that.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This game is beyond what I could've imagined. The only real experience with The Legend of Zelda I had as a child was A Link to the Past, only recently didn't I get more into ""newer"" games, like Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask, but Breath of the Wild does not even compare. Get ready to invest countless hours into exploring the vast expanses of the universe that Nintendo created for this newest Zelda title. I can play several gaming sessions solely exploring new areas I haven't explored. The combat, ill admit, took some getting used to, and there are some shortcomings to the combats aspects, which you will see for yourself once you start playing the game, but nothing that makes it not worth buying. So far the only downside is there aren't any of the classic gadgets like we used to have like the hookshot or big hammer, but, granted, I'm not very far into this game yet. So, yeah, if you've played any of the other Zelda games, you will be more than delighted with this one! 10/10.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,9,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Had not played a game console basically since nintendo 64, bought this one with a Nintendo Switch and loved it. Even though I'm not a video game expert, is a beautiful game, amazing music, and very very immersive...I think I've never spent as much time as I have spent in this game, is basically limitless. Even thought I already finished the game is just fun to play around, ride the horses, battle enemies, or try to beat the imposible DLC of the master sword for 100 time...I heard Nintendo was going back to their throne regarding the quality of their games and playing this game can't doubt it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,9,2020,√âtats-Unis

This game looks beautiful half the time if I'm not fighting or exploring I'm taking in the beautiful scenery and making screen captures. I really love the climbing aspect if you see it you can pretty much climb it I love it so much and I can't put it down it really just draws you in with the atmosphere you feel like you really are in this massive world curious ready to explore. When you die it's even awesome to die you might get angry or you might laugh maybe even feel sad but hey saving is wonderful so when you come back you can try again or run like crazy both great options. If you buy this game you will get 60+ hours just from exploring and doing other stuff so you getting you money's worth I enjoy this game so much and I hope you do as well!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

No es ninguna broma y no soy un fan ciego de Nintendo puesto que tambien cuento con Xbox One y PS4. Pero este juego vale mucho la pena. Este juego es gigante son como 20 juegos en uno puedes hasta surfear en Nieve. Surfear en Arena. Te gustan los calabozos bueno este juego cuenta con mas de 120 digo mas por que para encontrar algunos calabozos necesitas hacer algunos acertijos que contarian como otra manera de hacer calabozos para que aparezcan los otros calabozos. Hay semillas regadas por todo el mapa mas de 800 y cada semilla es otro acertijo. Y 4 calabozos principales de la historia. Mas de 300 armas demasiadas armaduras demasiados escudos. Enemigos poderosos el sistema de batalla es impresionante. Ya no me acuerdo de tanto que da este juego es casi ilimitado si lo quieres acabar al 100%. He pagado ese mismo precio por otros juegos y la verdad no contienen ni el 15% de contenido con todo y si bajaras el DLC de lo que te da este Zelda solito es impresionante. Bien por Nintendo me impresiono. Pagar este precio por zelda la verdad se me hace muy barato y mas que te da mas de 300 horas de juego si lo quieres acabar al 100% con todo.No me lo espere.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,5,2017,Mexique
"Yes, best game EVER!  You can roam free and pick your own path to adventure (you are not locked to a sequence of events and if you're good enough you could defeat the game from the start or meander at your leisure). Even my young kids like this title!  Pretty sophisticated UI, advance attack techniques to master are well worth the effort. Cooking is a treat! do it right and you will be doing well.

"I stop playing Nintendo games since 1996 and I bought a switch this past holiday season to basically play Mario Kart with my girlfriend and friends once and a while. I also bought Zelda because of the hipe but didn't really thought I would get much into it. Boy I was so wrong... I haven't finish the game yet but I've played for maybe around 25 hours and even my girlfriend likes to sit next to me when I play. It's hard to describe it other than saying ""IT IS TONS OF FUN"" I've started playing Zelda when I was already playing RE2 remake on PS4 (amazing game also) but I haven't returned to it because Zelda just got me trapped.It is true, if you have a nintendo switch you must get Zelda otherwise you'll miss one great game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,1,2020,Mexique
"4.5/5 stars. Best game I've played in a long time. Very gorgeous open world with endless things to do and discover. If you like climbing than this is the best game you'll ever play because there is ALOT of it here. I especially appreciate how they threw in a bit of heart felt story-telling, I would have liked a bit more story but I know that's not in the vein of a true zelda game. All-in-all great game in the open-world action adventure genre. Know that this is every bit an open-world game with all that comes with it, tons of nodes to visit and items to collect. If that's not your thing than this might not be for you.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2020,√âtats-Unis

Solve complicated puzzles that will make you want to throw your switch across the room! (seriously, that maze ball thing where you have to flip the ball over to the other side of the room at the end? Really?)At first I thought this game was too easy, but in time I found it to be rather enjoyable. Suitable for all ages, I'd definitely recommend this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I have been a Legend of Zelda fan since Ocarina of Time.  That was the first Zelda I have ever played.  I skipped out on the Wii and Wii U.  I just never got the concept of either.  I bought the Nintendo Switch because it is a portable console that is unlike anything else out there.  I am currently deployed and I am accustom to gamming on my PS4 with my 4K TV.  The last game I played before deploying was Horizon Zero Dawn.  When I purchased this game I was thinking ""how could this game hold a candle to that game""  I was very wrong.  This game is epic in every sense of the word.  It is simply breathtaking and mind boggling how much things you can do.  This has to be one of the best games of all time, if you are on the fence like I was, than you have to give this game a shot.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

"The scope of this game is far larger than I would've imagined. Puzzles and dungeons range from being easy enough to complete within 5 minutes to being complex enough to have you scratching your head for a while.

Still a great game in 2021.First play through I didn‚Äôt try to do everything and spent around 40 hours.Second play through was extremely thorough getting most things and spent a good 50 hours. Take into consideration that I already knew most the game the second time around. So how to get stuff, beat enemies and solve puzzles was easy quick.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"It arrived and plays prefectly. At first, I wasn't heavily into it because the weapons and shields breaking was frustrating, especially when fighting really difficult enemies. After getting into a certain part of the game and finding out what I could really do in fights besides just wildly swinging weapons, dodging, and blocking, the game started to get really exciting, especially when you get good at preforming perfect guards. The puzzles, challenges, and endless quests give you a lot to do. The game also doesn't penalize you for completing challenges in your own way. As long as you complete the goals, it's satisfied. So this makes for quite a bit of replay value.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,5,2020,√âtats-Unis
"This is hands down one of the best games I ever played in my life. It took me 120 hours to complete. I am not a perfectionist but tried to complete all the quests I could. It was my first game on switch. The way the world has been created is very unique. I have played Skyrim, Witcher and am a fan of rpgs in general but never knew a console can make a difference. Nintendo makes few AAA exclusives but the ones they make are worth few times over their cost.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,5,2021,Inde
"This is probably one of if not the best Legend of Zelda game ever made. It takes the series in a New Direction by being the first Zelda game in an open-world setting. That adds lots of new opportunities for players. The game takes over 100 hours to beat with all the side missions, and at no point do the side missions feel underdone or watered down. The game features a lot of customization. You can also cook a variety of different things‚Äã which is really fun. The storyline is really easy to understand, especially for someone who hasn't played a game in The Legend of Zelda series before. It's also been one of the more challenging Zelda games in a long time. If I could combined three games to describe this game I would use Skyrim, fallout, and Minecraft. It has some elements from each of those games and of course it has the signature Zelda feel. If you're thinking about picking up this game you won't be disappointed even if you've never played a game in the series.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"After finishing my first play through of this game 2 years ago, I made the mistake of giving my other copy away to a friend who had not yet had the privilege of playing it. I spent a good amount of time thinking about whether I wanted to be the kind of person who would pay 120 for a single game (2 copies, but still). I decided it was more than worth it and the one proud expense I would ever make twice.The replayability of this game is so big that I  felt it was worth buying it again. I will hold onto this copy for dear life and hopefully one day I'll beat the trial of the sword in master mode.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"As a gamer who was able to enjoy the original Legend of Zelda during it's prime, BoTW is an incredible achievement to the series. I haven't been so taken in by a Zelda game since the original.  The world is so huge, with so many paths to take and ways to accomplish things. Too many games are plagued by being linear and needing to do X before you get to Y.  I love that Zelda gives you a quick intro and then basically tells you to ""have at it"" as it sends you out into it's gigantic world. It helps to produce that ""epic adventure"" feeling while playing the game.I feel like i've put a lot of time into the game until I look at my map and see how much of the world I still have left to see and explore. If you are looking for a game that you can really sink some hours into, Breath of The Wild is definitely a game to consider. It's a MUST OWN if you are a fan of the Zelda series for sure.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Gorgeous game with plenty of appeal. I held off buying this for over a year, but all the hype about the game ending up being true. I played for about an hour a day for a week and eventually gave up in annoyance of the flimsy weapons the game provides. You only get some much use out of the weapons before the break and you must find a replacement. I'm a fan of anything Zelda and am too accustomed to having a sturdy sword and other obtainable weapons as I progress in a game, but it's just ridiculous to have a sword break in the middle of a fight.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Anyways, I absolutely love this game and would like to give it 4.5 stars. I think it deserves better than a 4, but not quite a perfect score of a 5. Given the number of rather large gripes that I had with the game, I felt it important to round down to a 4 instead. I really look forward to the next game but I hope people can acknowledge and admit the game's shortcomings, otherwise, these things won't be fixed in order to give us the most refined and amazing follow-up that we all are already salivating for.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,9,2020,√âtats-Unis

I was not even sure if I wanted to buy a Nintendo Switch but so far i'm really enjoying it, and I've really only played Zelda thus far after owning it for a few weeks.  I originally decided to buy the Switch mainly because I travel a decent amount for work, but now I find myself playing the darned thing in my office too!  I'm my own boss so I've got to discover some self-discipline soon or I may be in trouble.  And my god this game is so addicting.  I have put about 20 hours into it already and I feel like i'm still just beginning the game.  You can get lost in the open world, the cooking, crafting, side missions, main missions, gear upgrades and puzzles and hidden surprises etc etc.  All in all one of the best open world experiences ever created in gaming.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,2,2018,√âtats-Unis

This game really proves one thing, people flock to hype.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2022,√âtats-Unis

Honestly, I did not grow up with Zelda games, so I am not very familiar with the monsters and characters you come across in the series, but my girlfriend knew everything that popped up, and I found it so adorable that she knew. I have now been converted and only wish that I played Zelda games early on. (Although he was my favorite character in Super Smash Bros lol.) This is an absolute must for Zelda fans, old and new. The music is serene, chaotic, and whimsical, and the mechanics are sweet. I love the attention to detail but the one thing I don't like is WHY CAN'T LINK PET THE DOGS AT THE STABLES?? Would've been so satisfying to watch the puppies enjoy the caresses of a Hylian. Sigh. Anyway, 5 stars out of 5 I would buy this again.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2019,√âtats-Unis

"As a delivered product it came quickly and in great shape; absolutely no complaints there.As a game I'm a huge fan of the direction they're going.More survival aspects here without being overwhelming for the casual player. I'm not a fan of the motion control based puzzles as it makes the very minimal amount of latency IN those motion controls substantially more noticeable. This game is still going to go down as a masterpiece in my humble opinion.The combat is less forgiving than in previous titles; if you throw a boomerang you must manually catch said boomerang. Going into a fight absent mindedly and thinking you'll reflex your way through it is also not going to end well for you.The puzzle solving is still here, but the dungeons are in greater number on average but with less of a time commitment individually. This does NOT take away from the feeling of epicness/adventure.Overall I still believe this game will be regarded as a masterpiece.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,7,2018,√âtats-Unis

"I've read many 0-1 star reviews here and on metacritic, and most of them appear to just be complaints about shipping speed or framerate drops. I don't understand how picky you could be about a game with heavy hardware limitations. You don't need perfect frame rates or fluid motions or everything immediately loaded to enjoy a great game unless you really enjoy complaining about trivial matters. These are the type of people who need 1ms response to make even minesweeper enjoyable.This game looks absolutely amazing on the switch itself and still vibrant and pretty while docked. Mechanics are intuitive, but may require some prior research. Shrines are short, but with the addition of motion control based puzzles (oh god), I'm happy that they aren't too long.I normally hate open world games because of how repetitive they get and how quickly they morph into walking simulators (even FFXV with all the quick travel took forever), but zelda is large enough to feel vast, but the gliding and teleportation makes getting places much easier.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Certainly one of the best games ever made. This game is very different from past tittles, the open world experience is unlike any other. I found it fun and addicting, even got my wife who doesn't like games besides Tetris and Mario kart 64 addicted, and if that is possible then this game did things right.It's fun and easy to get into, the game offers tons of side content to keep you busy for probably +100 hours. It has so much to offer that it feels like I been playing DLC without the DLC (and that's something even more to look forward to). After clocking over 60 hours I'm till finding all sorts of new locations and things to do. Best of all, almost everything in the game is optional, you'll get stronger and find better equipment the more time you clock in, however the game does let you dive into the void as early as you want and face your death.A great game for both new and old Zelda fans.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"First things first package came in right on time, no damage, still in its new game packaging. I was a little late on the BoTW game since the second one will be released soon, but I'm happy I did. The game is very immersive and you can play for his and still find something new. It's a pretty large map to explore. The quest line was fun and the dude quest help fill in the between quest phases. My only complaint is the voice acting in English was very cringe worthy so I turned my audio to literally every other language to compare and they all sounded much more like I imagine Zelda would. I ended up playing the game in Japanese with English subtitles.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Speaking as somebody who is not a huge Zelda fan, I loved this game to pieces. In about a month I put in over 200 hours, which is quite a bit considering I have a full time job. The game is beautifully done. It is easily one of the best games I have ever played. This game isn‚Äôt just about finishing it and beating the boss and seeing what happens next, it‚Äôs an experience in itself. It‚Äôs a whole world that feels alive and quirky and very explorable. I feel as though it has tons of replayability. Many people say that the story is lacking but I don‚Äôt believe that to be the case. No, the story is not front and center of this game like many other Zelda games but I think that‚Äôs okay. I believe that the characters are still well fleshed out. Zelda herself is amazing and well rounded. I believe this game is well worth the money.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I'll probably make a more extensive review at a later point, but for now here's one that will be hopefully useful to others.1. This game is highly well-recieved, critically and casually.2. It takes ""open world"" to a new level--once you get off the great plateau (which doesn't take long) you can do whatever you want, anywhere you want. If you want to go try to take on the final boss, naked and holding only a tree branch and cooking pot lid? Go for it. See a mountain or tree? Or wall? Or...monster? Climb it. You can climb anything. Everything you see, you can interact with or go to.3. This is different than most Zeldas in a few ways, but since no two are alike, that's fine4. This is probably going to be too difficult for the younger audiences, but they'll likely enjoy watching.It's a good game. Best of all time? That will come down to your opinion. But, it's worth playing, that's for sure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Awesome I would say borrow it and see if you like it first but really fun and challenging game,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Este t√≠tulo es un ‚Äúmust‚Äù para todos los fans de la Nintendo Switch: Sonido y m√∫sica perfecta, gr√°ficos incre√≠bles y excelente jugabilidad.S√≥lo hago notar que el juego es de mundo abierto y te adentra en el personaje haci√©ndote pensar qu√© hacer, es decir, el juego no te da una gu√≠a de como continuar con tu aventura, cada pista y peque√±o logro que hagas ser√° porque tu lo deduzcas....salvo que busques gu√≠as por Internet. Por lo que si prefieres jugar videojuegos en los que constantemente se te est√© guando en tu aventura (como por ejemplo Pokemon Sword/Shoeld), quiz√° este no sea el juego para ti.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,12,2020,Mexique
"My whole family is hooked. We were Twilight Princess devotees - even once my kids and I started playing, but the open, non-linear game play quickly grew on us. This game has a story and quests with an ultimate goal, but there is lots of freedom just to explore and roam. It is more fun ""getting there"". All of us are approaching the game different ly and completing tasks in different ways. It is fun just. to immerse yourself in this world and get lost. Plenty of cool things to do (or not do) along the way with lots of challenges, puzzles, quests, and gear to collect. Worth the price.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I'm revising to 5 stars after playing to completion.  To say BOTW differs vastly from any other game in the series is an understatement.  But to be fair, so has essentially every generation of Zelda release.I found a few areas frustrating as all get-out (i.e. Yiga Hideout), but the sense of freedom allows you to tackle the main quest objectives in almost any order and do as many or few shrine quests as you prefer.  Speaking if which, I believe there are 100 total shrines to be found, each with its own puzzles and rewards.  Traditional dungeons aren't completely dead though.  There are 4 ""Divine Beast"" dungeons that must be completed as part of the main quest.Overall, this is a fresh experience for a 30-year veteran of the series.  It took a bit of patience, but in the end a truly awesome experience lies in this game.  Now, Nintendo, please give us a Metroid game that so well matches ambition with execution!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
This game is absolutely amazing! It's jam-packed with a ton of amazing gameplay that will last you months. It's outstanding and is definitely one of the greatest games of all time. It's graphics are amazing and story is super fun and not too easy or hard. It makes minecraft sit in the corner and cry because of him much more effort and reward this game had. The 120 shrines that you can do are amazingly challenging and have great reward for completing all of them. The story is not too long or short so it is very good to play through. The games layout is breathtaking and has a great play style and has multiple great game mechanics like climbing up mountain tops and fighting giant robots and freezing in midair to shoot an arrow at your enemy. There is nothing like a nice Zelda game to get your adrenaline pumping and your heart racing. This game is the best game I have ever played and probably will be forever.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
I love this game. I had previously played it on the Wii U and decided to get it for the Switch as well and experience it all over again.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,1,2022,Canada
"Breath of the Wild is exactly what it sounds like... a breath of fresh air in the LoZ franchise. Everything about this game feels great, and all the new mechanics really give this game a unique feel. If you are expecting a normal LoZ game, this is not it (I recommend watching some gameplay to decide if this will be a good game for you). If you‚Äôre looking for an interesting new combat style, beautiful landscapes, challenging new enemies, and tons of mini-puzzles rather than the normal dungeons, this game is for you. This game gives me the little kid feeling I had when I was 10-11 years old playing Twilight Princess on the Wii and I cannot say that about many games. A must buy if you‚Äôre open to a new LoZ experience",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,8,2019,√âtats-Unis

"Un juego muy completo, horas de diversi√≥n, incre√≠ble historia y personajes bien desarrollados, en lo personal este es el mejor Zelda que he probado, obvio todos queremos a Ocarina Of Time ya que fue el que m√°s marco en la industra de los videojuegos, pero la verdad prefiero mil veces BOTW.Una compra que no te arrepentir√°s.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,10,2021,Mexique
"I love Zelda, but this game as well as the Switch are ridiculously overrated...It is touted as one of the only open-world games to not feel empty. This is because of the Korok seeds that are spread throughout, which are only annoying to have to find all of them. I wouldn't call that not being empty...The trials are fun, but short. The beasts (dungeons) are laughably short and the boss fights are easy. The only bit of challenge comes in the form of unintuitive controls, which you cannot change (with the exception of swapping 2 inputs, run/jump I think). The cutscenes are nice, and the ability to change the audio language is nice; however, the English subtitles are the English script, not a translation of the Japanese.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,9,2019,√âtats-Unis
"The controls are difficult. I keep accidentally bringing up the camera or zooming in using the binoculars function when in the middle of a boss fight, and it's very frustrating. Also moving and firing the slate runes are done with the same thumb, which is very inconvenient. Very pretty game, fun to explore everywhere until I run into something far above what I can handle and have no idea that I can't handle it. I keep dying, which is mostly my own fault when it's not because of the issues mentioned above, but it is difficult to know how hard an enemy will hit, so sometimes it's a major surprise when all the hearts are gone. I wish there was a way to cook food in larger quantities rather than just one at a time.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I... have never been so taken aback by the vastness of a game. You really don't need to read another review, Zelda alone is worth the price of a switch. Like if they sold this game for 300 dollars I would probably buy it. In fact, it's the only Switch game I own, and have no real plans to purchase anything else because between the original game and Master Mode, I will be getting a divorce soon so I can spend more time collecting mushrooms and climbing mountains.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
The game is legit (not an illegal knockoff) copy that comes in its original case. Plays as the game is intended to play (flawlessly.) Only drawback is the game did not come with an instruction manual.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,11,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I've been playing Zelda games since they came out.  I've played them all.  I've also bought almost every guide for them.  I love the ""Breath of the Wild"" game.  I don't usually buy a hard cover book, but I am sooooooo  glad I bought this one.  (I'm an old lady, so print is a bit small for me) but it is so good to have all the information I need when I get stuck.  This book is great!  I'm not a bit sorry of the cost!  Thanks Trump.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
"If for some reason you own a Nintendo Switch and DO NOT own this game you NEED to buy it!  It is an open world RPG with endless options, quests and adventure.

This game is huge and really fun,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2022,√âtats-Unis
"The aliasing is disappointing but not terribly detracting from the experience.  Same with the FPS drops in busier areas.  It all exists, but the gameplay is engrossing enough for it to be more or less ignored without a problem.  I've yet to encounter significant framerate issues whenever I'm doing something that matters.The controls are both excellent and terrible.  Little things like the motion controls to aim and shoot your bow are fantastic and extremely natural feeling, whereas bigger things like aiming yourself to throw a held object (like a bomb or a rock) feels like I'm using an 8-way D-pad.The voice acting, as has been pointed out, is less than good.  The first guy you meet is, thus far, the only good voice acting I've heard in the game.  Zelda and other characters you meet who have voice acting are all just... not good.I'll definitely be picking up the DLC and sinking a decent amount of time into this game.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"My god, great game.  Part of me misses the old school not having to cook tons of stuff or explore a seemingly endless world with dispersed plot lines and the thing I miss most is the big dungeons and dungeon boss battles.  But this game is soooo cool in other ways and still in a lot of ways pays homage to the N64 zelda games.  Like even though I want those old school things, this game is so incredible in it's own way.  It is vast and fun and very realistic feeling.  This game makes you think at times and doesn't hold your hand which thank god I don't have tips telling me I move around with the left joystick like yeah I've played a game before in my life.  Nice to see Zelda for a grown up crowd.  Fantastic visuals run polished controls.  Endless weapons.  Puzzles, trials, upgrates, powers all that good stuff.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I was on the fence about this for a long time, mostly because it was so expensive and I'm pretty tight with my money. Finally bought it and, wow, this really is as good as advertised. Almost too good. Like the way I've heard people describe what it's like to take opioids is how I feel when I play this. Entire hours go by, so be careful. But if you're looking for a good game to buy, it won't be wasted if you buy this.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The package arrived with streaks ending in multiple clumps of‚Ä¶ something. Wiped it down (was gonna anyway, pandemic and all) and opened and the game itself plays OK but like I can‚Äôt get over trying to figure out what was on the outer package lol.

"El juego me lleg√≥ r√°pidamente y en perfectas condiciones. Este juego es algo verdaderamente sensacional sin importar que conozcas los juegos de Zelda o no. Hay miles de cosas por hacer y muchos retos que pondr√°n a prueba tu ingenio y habilidades de juego. Aconsejo que si compras el juego tambi√©n compres el DLC puesto a que ofrece muchas cosas que complementan bien el juego.Mi √∫nica ""queja"" es que la caja donde viene el cartucho es excesivamente grande considerando el tama√±o de los cartuchos de juego. Fuera de eso, este juego es imprescindible si es que decidiste comprar un Nintendo Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,12,2020,Mexique
"This is one of my favorite Zelda games to play on my Nintendo Switch Lite.

The adventure game provides lots of enjoyment on completing adventures though the gameWorks great with the Nintendo switch,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,3,2022,Canada
"I still have Ocarina of Time as being the all time best Zelda game, but BOW is in a close 2nd place.  The BOW map is insane!  The amount of detail that the creators put into it will blow you away.  It will take you an ungodly amount of time to explore every area of the map and to complete all of the available quests.  If there were anything to improve on it, it would be that they should have returned to the charm of the characters and music that Ocarina of Time had.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"So do I love adventure? Traveling, sight seeing, swimming, flying through the air on an ancient paraglide? Yes I sure do. It‚Äôs a beautiful game with lots of fun. If you‚Äôve played any Zelda games you know what‚Äôs up. If you haven‚Äôt you should try it. Even if you were disappointed this game is a hot seller you could probably get most of your money back. I loved making food and potions that gave me defense or attack power. I loved chasing after those luminous stones in the distance. So much so I twinkled a teal color through my neighbors window and I wanted to set said on adventure!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,3,2020,√âtats-Unis

"Breath of the Wild is very open world and let's you go at your own pace. For a game released in 2017, it feels like the graphics were from 2021. It is perfect for something to do during the summer because it has so many hours of gameplay, not including expansions. Anybody, Zelda fan or not, will find this experience brand new.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I am completely new to this genre of game, I never even played Zelda back in the day (though I was a fan of N64). For a newbie like me the game is a little hard at the beginning but oh my god is it fun. When you're feeling discouraged about a specific quest or you want to practice elsewhere - guess what? There's a whole freaking world you can do that in! I almost have FOMO with this game, knowing I won't be able to possibly do everything, but also it's super exciting because I don't feel the need to blaze through it. I'm taking my time and really enjoying the gameplay. The switch is a crazy-fun console and this game is truly amazing, I would definitely definitely recommend it.Updating review - after probably 60 hours of gameplay I'm still loving it. If you must, just buy the damn switch for this game alone.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,5,2018,√âtats-Unis

Something for everyone.They took the great design and nostalgia of the original game and brought it to life.This is like Skyrim but in the world of Zelda. Open world, lots of hidden gems (literal and figurative), side quests and mail quests, armor and weapon upgrades, horses, exploration.

"Para mi el juego es lindo y entretenido, hay mucho por explorar y las din√°micas son geniales, su √∫nico defecto es que a partir de cierto punto se vuelve repetitivo. El juego para mi fue una nueva tecnolog√≠a que Nintendo est√° explorando, y no alcanz√≥ a desarrollar una historia y calabozos propiamente, por ello recurrieron a din√°micas repetitivas, sin embargo el juego es disfrutable. La expansi√≥n (comprada a parte) lo hace much√≠simo m√°s entretenido y para mi la expansi√≥n y el modo heroico deber√≠a haber sido el default, pero a√∫n as√≠ es un muy buen juego y merece todos los premios.El castillo de Hyrule es hermoso, y las voces en espa√±ol son buenas, aunque lo mejor es que puedes escoger el doblaje original en japon√©s y conservar los subt√≠tulos.En general un excelente juego.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,1,2020,Mexique

I was hesitant on buying BOTW because I heard that it was hard, but a review stating that it was ‚Äúas hard as you want it to be‚Äù urged me to buy it. Ultimately, I did. It is my favorite game right now! Definitely a must buy. Sure, some things do take a while, but it‚Äôs such a great feeling when you finally accomplish it! Super fun. The graphics are AMAZING!

I have put 120+ hours into this game already, and am still amazed at how much there is to do and how fun it is to do it all.. the game manages not to feel tedious at all.I don't think this is the type of game that people will be mulling over, whether or not they want to buy it..

I've played all of them, mostly on a high powered gaming PC, but not even the simpler graphics of this console will bog down your experience with this game. BotW is definitely one of the best games ever created. The scope and magnitude are unbelievable, however this is one of the best populated games ever made, very inch of the map is filled with excitement and it will take a ridiculous amount of time to see it all.It's a game that will let you take your time and go as fast or as slow as you want, but be sure that there's no dull moment in it.

Then this game came along, and now I'm torn between choosing favorites. The sheer vastness of the world and what you can do is truly incredible, along with the beauty of the graphics and the scenery.

"For the first time in a long time, Nintendo treats gamers as though they have played games before. There is no tutorial, most of your abilities are unlocked in he first couple hours of the game, and you have the freedom to play this game however you want. You may beat a shrine using a completely different strategy than someone else. Dungeons can be completed in any order. Areas of the map can almost all be accessed at any point, regardless of progression. There are mini bosses located randomly throughout the world. Many different weapons and armor. Survival aspects are present in the breakdown of weapons and cooking system. I still have another dungeon to complete before heading the castle, and I have 85 hours in the game. Bottom line, fan of Zelda or not, this ia a great game. Don't listen to the pessimists that are angry because they couldn't find a Switch, this game is fantastic and totally worth your time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I can't say enough about how much I love the game. Long playing hours, great game mechanisms, surprising and fun details in the open world, nice graphics. I bought NS just for this game and it's already worth it. It's not like the typical RPG game in which you need to spend time doing tasks and leveling up, this game doesn't have levels but only a huge world awaiting for you to explore (you can die if you're not strong enough though).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Absolutely amazing game.  Open world with similar Zelda franchise mechanics while introducing new resource management concepts.  Over 100 hours of first time play value if desired.  More for repeat play if that's your thing.  Less if you're in a hurry to finish.After the initial four shrines that teach you the core mechanic and opens up the entire map, you're left to your own devices to explore and continue the story line.  As you continue you can opt in to side quests and world exploration before progressing the main arch.  I didn't feel like I wasted any time on the side quests and exploration I did until I was about to face the final boss.  At some point you feel as though you explored 95% of the map and the extra time isn't adding value.  I never completed 100% but definitely got in over 100 hours before completing the main story line.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Really fun game currently I have like over 75 game play hours into the game. I love the open world and being able to enter basically any part of the world. I am a newcoming fan of the legend of Zelda series, but I am a huge fan of games with quests and an open world where I can go out and do what I please. The only thing that I have to complain about is just one part of the main quest only due to me not being sneaky enough to be fair but I just believe there should be a sneaky way to avoid having to sneak through the place and just be able to get right to the boss or at least have checkpoints. Other than that the fact that you don't have to follow a set way to do things is amazing in my opinion.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
This game is amazing! I‚Äôve wanted it for a long time. It went on sale finally. Definitely recommend this!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,1,2022,√âtats-Unis
"This was the perfect launch title for the Switch. Personally, I would say this title alone is worth getting a Switch for. The amount of care and effort that has gone into this game is very evident from all the fun that you can have.This game goes back to the roots of the first Zelda on the NES, and lets you loose in a vast open world (after completing a tutorial-like section). A lot of the story is implied, not said out loud. As such there aren't many talking characters but the few cut-scenes are a joy to watch.The game looks fantastic even in portable mode, and the new art style for this game adds another layer of charm to this game.This game is slightly challenging however, as the enemies you face always scale up to you and inventory management becomes slightly tedious because of the mechanic in which all shields and weapons will break after some usage.If you want, you can run straight to the castle with link in his underpants to defeat Ganon with a stick. The game won't stop you, though the fight may convince you about the need to collect better gear from the various enemy creatures first.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2019,Inde
hi i am on my dads account but i am reviewing.i really enjoy playing this game and i think this is one of the best if not the best game for the nintendo switch i would recommend to pretty much anyone even if your not a fan of zelda im still playing through it and im loving it i beated divine beast vah ruta and got the master sword with my dad and its amazingly fun for all ages but i thing younger kids would find it hard.i hope this helped!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
I bought it as gift to my boyfriend. He loves it! He plays every day and abandoned other games. First choice for the first switch game! You will never regret.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I pre-ordered this game at my boyfriend's insistence when we bought the Switch. I'm not a big gamer (I was mostlty looking forward to playing Mario Kart) and I've never played any of the Zelda games before, so I assumed I would never play this. When the console arrived, this was the only game we had for it because our other pre-ordered games haven't been released yet. I decided to give it a try, and after a few days of learning the controls and figuring out the gameplay, I've become totally obsessed with this game. I played for four hours last night and had to drag myself away when it was time to go to bed.The graphics are phenomenal, the storyline is interesting, and there's so much more to do than I could have imagined. You could entertain yourself for hours just running around exploring and collecting things even if you didn't want to play the actual storyline. I can't recommend this game enough, even for non-gamers and non-Zelda fans.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I love the open world but, at times it was just vast emptyness that takes forever get over things, Some of the side missions were alot of fun like monster hunting ones but 70% were boring puzzle's or fetching things for people that for me at least was just frustrating and dull which brings me to my next problem, WAY TO MANY PUZZLES, some of the puzzles where very fun and intresting to complete but most were just dull time consumers,Oh and though the side bosses around where fun but most of them are just copys of each of that are slightly altered, and the weird cross-dressing at that one part made me want to die. despite its flaws there is so much that it does insanely well so i was torn between giving it a 3or4 but with how different and original this game is it deserves a 4 star.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Game is great, but a bit over hyped. Would give 4.5 stars but not possible so 5 stars it is.Gameplay wise, it felt alot like a FarCry game (tower climbing to receive map of area) but without the fun sneaking around and silent takedowns that made capturing a Base or Camp in FarCry fun. Shrine puzzles were a little too easy IMO, it was harder to find all 120 then the puzzles themselves.Combat can get a bit repetitive (dodge,attack,dodge,attack,weapon breaks) and once you figure out certain enemy weapon weakness, its becomes fairly easy.And lets not mention the breakable weapons mechanics, which is a bit annoying.Story wise, well lets just say that, if it wasn't a open-world game, alot of people would beat the game in an hour.Overall a Great/Good game and would definitely recommend to any Switch owner to get ( also because there aren't that many games for the switch",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Best gameplay loop of any Zelda game, but not enough big dungeons or bosses. You can easily play the game a hundred hours before beating it, but there are only four main dungeons besides the final boss level. Twilight Princess, OoT, Wind Waker and Link to the Past all have far more bosses and dungeons, which are the highlights of the Zelda series. The moment-to-moment gameplay loop makes up for it, and it's probably the single most impressive portable game on the market right now.Breath of the Wild is a wonderful introduction to the Switch, and a great way to pass the time until other great games launch on the system. There's tons to do, from shrines to quests to main missions, and a wide variety of enemies, flora, fauna and equipment. If there were more bosses and dungeons, it would be the best Zelda yet, but instead it's merely an early contender for Game of the Year 2017.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Todos conocemos la saga Zelda, esta entrega es el pin√°culo de la misma y establece las bases para los pr√≥ximas entregas de la misma.Es un juego sumamente sorprendente por el nivel de detalle, las f√≠sicas del mismo son fuera de todo lo que se ha hecho en la industria, es una obra de arte.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,9,2021,Mexique

"So let me start by saying, I'm not a Zelda fan. I've never played the games nor had any interest in them. I bought this for my husband who has played the games his whole life. However, after watching him play a couple weeks, it caught my attention so I gave it a try and FELL IN LOVE with it! It was so beautifully done with so much content and a great story line! The learning curve was steep for someone who is not super into gaming but when I did learn all the controls, I had a blast and spent the next 3 months obsessing over this game! It turned out to be a present for the both of us :)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,8,2019,√âtats-Unis

"A great addition to the Zelda universe and a pretty solid game for breaking from the typical LOZ formula. You can spend hours exploring, fighting, and collecting in this game and still only break the surface. The minor drawbacks (and they are very minor) do nothing to hinder how enjoyable the game is.  Possibly one of the best Open World games ever.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Many have already gone into lots of detail about the game, so I'll spare you my lengthy detailed thoughts. I'll just add my voice to the throngs and say that THIS GAME IS FREAKING AMAZING. I never thought I could like a Zelda game more than Ocarina of Time or Wind Waker, but I never had nearly as much fun playing either of those as I do while playing this. I literally haven't been this hooked on a video game since I was like 10.So there you go. This game is good. REALLY good. And SO worth $60, because you can literally get over 100 hours of play time easy, and still have more to explore.My one tiny little gripe would be that the controls aren't very intuitive and don't make a lot of sense. DOESN'T MATTER. STILL ONE OF THE BEST GAMES EVER CREATED. High five, Nintendo, all my frustrations after two delays have melted away.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"What to say even?! This game is just what I remembered when I got the golden cartridge N64 Ocarina of Time. And that was years after I got the original gold NES cartridge (I'm 34). The game is huge, fun, challenging, nostalgic (personally if they switched *haha* a few names they would just be a darker sequel to OoT) and just flat out immersive. The ONLY complaint I have is the weapons breaking just a bit too easy and no way to craft weapons. That literally is the only flaw IMO. And I am retro as hell besides FPS and LoL (which I will use this forum to reiterate that League has the worst community ever). My friends watched me play and they were in awe. I played for 5 minutes and I was hooked (which doesn't say much, I'm just a huge Nintendo and Zelda fan) but I bought the switch and this and I have no regrets.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

I normally play a lot of Xbox One and PS4 action/adventure type games, but this is an awesome change of pace.When I was a teenager, the original Legend of Zelda was released and I got it for Christmas. I loved it so much!  It changed console gaming forever, introducing a new type of game where there was a story you care about.Over the years, there have been some Zelda games I have played, and some that I have skipped. I am so glad I didn't skip this one.Best part of this game is the puzzles. They are so smart. You can tell a great deal of thought has gone into these.This game makes the Switch worth the purchase. Even though there aren't many other games right now for it, there will be some awesome first party games. Maybe even a new Metroid.Thank you Nintendo!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"As of currently I'm still playing The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and I have to say this Zelda game will be passed down for generations in my opinion it's open world is so beautiful, the story is very well detailed & everything (despite some issues I had on the switch) is well done. The weapon system makes you be careful on what you use as a weapon withing your quest & this works well for people who use there weapons carelessly like I have before. I love the environment feel to the game as well. I would say this is probably one of if not the best Zelda games in a top 5 list the creators sure did step it up with this direction and I'm impressed so far I recommend this game to anyone who hasn't played a zelda game at all or anyone who loves these kind of games you won't be disappointed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm a life long Zelda fan so I had to get this. I've not beat it yet as of this review, but I'm pretty far along in the game. If you're a Zelda fan then it's a must buy as it expands on the Zelda formula in great ways. My only gripe is the small usage of motion controls in a few portions of the game (a few shrines and the bow aiming although you can disable bow aiming motion controls, but not the shrines where you have to use motion controls). I always play my Switch in docked mode so can't say how it compares docked vs undocked and I also use a pro-controller so can't say how playing with the default controller stacks up. This is definitely going to be the definitive Zelda game from thus point forward ... unless they somehow combine the best of WindWaker with BOTW then I'd be in heaven.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Can't decide if I want to buy the master quest/hard mode dlc, because these boss fights were disappointingly, almost sleepwalkingly, simple. Arguably, the hallmark of the Zelda series is twofold, boss fights and treasure based puzzles. Nintendo has switched up this formula to primarily physics puzzles and exploration choosing to limit boss fights in favor of more intense everyday encounters, which I don't dislike and a staggeringly large map that boasts some truly splendid vistas and amusing secrets. I can honestly say I enjoyed this game, played it every day to completion and was invested enough to get the best ending completely by accident on the first playthrough, but the story, ultimately, is a little weak and relies heavily on tropes and bad character archetypes; you will hate the voice acting, but love the character design. I want the Zelda series to branch out and offer more, but I would rather it be more compelling.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm ashamed to admit how long it's been since I played a Zelda title, but this was the first game I bought when I got my Switch.  While I'm not a huge fan of the ""no permanent gear"" aspect, it's manageable.  The more I play, the better this game gets, taking the best ideas from previous games and adding it's own unique feel.  I'm especially a fan of the Ghibli-esque quality of the game design and the subtle changes to the music as you navigate the world.  And it's so expansive!  I'm certain I will not complete this game before the sequel arrives, but I look forward to playing that too!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,9,2019,√âtats-Unis
"We won a Nintendo Switch at a Christmas raffle.  I looked up the games available.  I thought over $50 was kind of high for a video game, but Zelda was one of the highest rated.  So I got it.  And it is really good.  The animation is pretty amazing.  The first month, of discovering different areas, was pretty fun. Discovering the world of Zelda is like exploring Disneyland.  There are different areas, and each area has it's own special character, landscape and weather.  There are three levels of quests.  The main quests like destroying Ganon, or freeing the Divine Beasts.  Then shrine quests, and less significant quests.  And then after awhile you figure out what sort of things to look for to find Korok seeds.  The variety of challenges and puzzles is very creative.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"After years of not understanding the hype behind gaming, I bought this when it first launched. Now that I have loved it to bits and explored every vast nook and cranny imaginable in the past almost four years through multiple run throughs, I have been left to try to find a game that lives up to botw. I have not succeeded. Can't wait for the sequel, this game deserves and even exceeds its 5 star overall score.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,11,2020,√âtats-Unis

I've read the reviews and watched some gameplay trailers but i have to say that none of that does it any justice.  I'm about 10 hours in and I can't put it down.  Gameplay, graphics, sounds, and music are all top notch!  Whqt a fantastic game!  So far I would let my younger children play it.  WOULD being the operative word.

"And being among the best Zelda games ever makes it one of the best games ever. I'm sure you've heard about it breaking the tried and true Zelda formula. It most definitely does, but the development team somehow managed to make Breath of the Wild FEEL like a Zelda game with a modern spin. I absolutely love Ocarina of Time, A Link to the Past, and Skyward Sword. I've got to let the dust settle to decide where BotW fits in. For me, it'll be anywhere from #1 to #3 on my all time favorite Zelda games.In short, purchase this game. You or the person you're buying it for will most definitely get your money's worth. You'll get at least 30 hours of entertainment out of it (that's $2/hr; cheaper than a movie), and that's if you fly through the game with a guide and YouTube. But what fun is that??",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Shouldn't need anyone to tell you how amazing Legend of Zelda games are. I've literally lost days of sleep and I'm maaaaybe 1/5 through it. I've been a LoZ fan since I've been gaming. While there are certainly games in the series that don't match quality - this is not one of those! I like few returning themes, charaters, and game play styles. However I LOVE the new lore, charater and play styles. I really enjoy challenging the new world and everything it's capable of.If you are complaining about this game:Just like when it comes to the core elements, ""Every book's already been writen"". The same goes for games. Take each game for what it is and stop comparing. If you could make something better - by all means go do it! Of course if you stillll don't like it, DON'T PLAY and give it to someone who'd love it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"11/10 must play I love BotW. The controls are solid, the flexibility in how to engage or avoid combat is incredible and so much fun. The world is massive. There are upgrades, exploration, labyrinths, puzzles, climate changes, weapons, armour. hidden stories and side quest galore.Besides my 11/10 score the game has one annoyance; rain climbing. Rain makes you unable to climb, which tends to take the flow of exploration away. The rain mechanic is great for everything else, including a plot related reason, how it changes the flora of the world and how lighting works. If I could mod the game I'd make climbing in the rain possible and use more stamina, but only after a related rain quest was complete. Water and climbing gear would negate the rain climbing penalty or be what makes it possible.Despite it's one annoyance BotW is a game everyone should play :)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

Its also challenging which is awesome compared to other games so dont get mad  becuase i can tell you you're gonna die ALOT lol. This game isn't like other games that try to sell you on just photo-realistic graphics alone but  the  art style of the game is remarkable, the story. how you play it  all the way down to the sheikah camera and how it focuses on different subjects when you move around ect.  most wouldn't  care but i did and im a photographer so nintendo def put in real detail.

"Great game with a very open world for you to climb all over. The only negative is there isn't a lot of variety to the activities, shrines, searching for 900 (not even kidding) hidden fairies, and a few side quests (some of which are pretty good). The voice acting is kind of awkward but nothing new to english dubs unfortunately.  The weapons are well varied with different fighting styles for each weapon type. The weapon durability is a bit of an issue in the beginning but as you progress you'll end up throwing out more stuff than you break. The music is a bit underwhelming for a zelda game but it's still good and you can listen to it for long periods of time without getting annoyed (no instrument to play in this game though.)

I sort of hate it, mostly love it, but I've only rarely been this frustrated with anything since the last Zelda game I played, but I think I hated that one. Weapon durability is dumb, make a crafting bench to repair items you like, so you don't have to get rid of weapons you do like, and get stuck with terrible weapons. I couldn't tell you how many bows I lost to the three hirnox's. I wish I could have kept the good ones, or at least repaired them to slightly worse condition.

I play a lot of games, and it's been a long time since I've felt this way after completing one.

The world is huge, but I still get distracted walking for five feet at whatever puzzle, shrine, or mysterious place I happen to run into. The only complaint I've heard about this game is that the weapons break. I actually really like this. There is something freeing about not having to worry about collecting and keeping amazing weapons when you can just as well pull an arm off of a skeleton and kill things with that.Did I mention that this game is gorgeous? I've played 60+ hours and I'm still finding interesting things that I've either missed or didn't have time to look at before.The switch may not have many games out now, but I honestly think just having Zelda: BOTW is worth the money.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Even after only have played the opening hours of the game thus far (the great plateau) I can't describe how much I love this game. The style of the game may not be AAA Battlefield 1, however the animation and use of colors always looks vibrant and crisp. I have only played the game docked (tv mode) so I can't speak for playing handheld. I think my favorite thing about the game is the shear sense of descovery and self learning. The game gives you a sandbox of mechanics with little explanation. This is something some people could be frustrated by, but staying open minded lets you have a ton of fun with it. I actually found myself laughing out loud by some of the animations and details (not the ""lol"" kind, the legitimate joy kind). This game is a 10/10, without a shadow of a doubt.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild‚Äôs sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild‚Äôs systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I‚Äôve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I‚Äôm in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.""IGN",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Compr√© el juego desde su lanzamiento y estoy muy satisfecho, he jugado muchos juegos de Zelda antes y pr√°cticamente todos brindan una buena experiencia de juego porque en cada t√≠tulo cambian determinadas mec√°nicas de juego que le dan un aire novedoso pero familiar a la vez.En este caso se ofrece much√≠sima m√°s libertad de acci√≥n al jugador, es decir, tienes la libertad de explorar donde quieras, el orden en que visitas determinados lugares clave, hay muchas opciones de combate o de evitarlo por completo.Seguramente existen muchas rese√±as en sitios dedicados (y que recomiendo leer antes de comprar), en mi opini√≥n esa libertad de acci√≥n hace que el juego lo puedan disfrutar un amplio sector del p√∫blico. Me refiero a que gamers apasionados encontraran un reto de buen nivel y calidad a lo que esperan, si eres un jugador casual puedes enfocarte solo en ciertas partes importantes del juego y a√∫n as√≠ disfrutarlo y si eres una persona que se est√° iniciando en los videojuegos puede disfrutar con calma la exploraci√≥n y tomarte el tiempo necesario hasta estar c√≥modo con todas las opciones que ofrece (en ese tiempo no perder√°s el inter√©s, estoy seguro).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,5,2017,Mexique
Been playing Zelda since 1987.  All I can say is this is absolutely my favorite Zelda title. It...Is... Huge. The detail that went into this game is insane. For instance... It's the little things that get me. Run with different items on your back and it'll make an appropriate clanking noise depending on what's back there. The physics are amazing too. I could go on and on ...On and on and on... But basically it comes down to this.  Do you like The Legend of Zelda? Then you really outta stop reading this and buy the game already.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Wow, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. It is evil good! It will monopolize ALL of your time. It is crazy fun and a huge world to explore. Spending time with family, friends and activities outside, house projects, hobbies and work all will take a lower priority. Gotta go and play. Gotta go find the next shrine.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game does not hold your hand. Whether that's a positive or negative depends on the person. Normally that's a negative to me but this game just does something right that makes it feel good. Probably the most fun I've had with an open world RPG in a long time.BTW, get the DLC too.

"I haven't played a lot of Zelda before, having dipped in a few titles here and there. I had originally bought this game because I always wanted to try the game as a first timer. Seeing as this is my first Zelda game I actually own, it exceeded all my expectations. The game looks absolutely beautiful. The graphics are so beautiful to look at, and it being so open world as it is I found myself wanting to explore everywhere. The controls were a little hard to get through since they are a lot of controls, but you get the hang of it afterwards. The game is just a bunch of fun for there's a lot of things you can do, and you can never get bored. This really is one of the best games I ever played, and you won't be disappointed if you get it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I had never played a video game in my life. I grew up on a farm, barely even had TV. I bought a switch to play Mario Cart and I bought Zelda on a whim because of the reviews. I DID NOTHING ELSE FOR THREE MONTHS! I even used the portable version for plane rides. I‚Äôm an adult. I have a degree and a job. This sucked me in and I could not put it down. I even completed it, then played it again to 100% completion (still working on that one, but at least I can put it down now...)!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is THE BEST game of 2017. If you love open world games, you will love this game. If you love exploring, you will love this game. If you love breathtaking visual, you will love this game. I loved every second that I played it. Currently, I have put over 200 hours into this game and I've yet to get sick of it. This was the update that the Zelda series needed. Everything about this game is a delight - the combat system (yes, I love the breakable weapons), the visuals, the shrines... everything about this game is great, trust me. If you have any doubts about this game, put them aside. I guarantee you that if you buy this game, you will have an amazing time. You will not regret it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,9,2018,√âtats-Unis

"I think I'm going against the grain, but this game is ok.  The camera is too slow, even at its fast setting, to battle some of the bosses.  I wouldn't mind the weapon deterioration so much if it didn't happen so fast.  I actually don't care as much about losing weapons as I do about having to swap out in the middle of a battle when one breaks.  Cooking is interesting, but WAY to tedious cooking up a bunch.  Having to wade through all of the materials and wait through the cooking animation is annoying.  Skipping the animation doesn't even save time.  Having a huge world is ok, but having to cross that huge world is tedious.  Fast travel is good, but I'd rather traveling by horse be a bit easier.  Just letting us call the current horse from wherever we are regardless of distance from the horse would help.  Being able to register a horse at more locations rather than having to travel so much out of your way.  As it is, I never use a horse because I don't want to go so far out of my way to get it.But, it is fun and the characters are interesting.  Having played lots of Zelda games it is cool to see references to other games and see old characters and monsters show up in a different form.  Figuring out the puzzles and how to beat the bosses is always an enjoyable challenge.  Exploring is fun and the graphics are beautiful.  Weather effects are cool, though rain can be irritating.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

You can tell that creators of this game spent a lot of time making this game and they did it right.  I am still early in the game but I am excited for more things to explore.  The game challenges you to be creative with cooking with different ingredients you have acquired.  Depending on what you cook with, the outcome is different.  I am loving this new aspect of the game.  I have only played the very first Zelda in the 80's and the Ocarina of Time on 3DS but you don't need to worry about the storyline.

"I'll admit, I'm a Zelda fan through and through!  I've even liked their games that folks weren't too keen on, even the ones that people grew to like down the road.  I know its a step away from the classic format, but I like the exploration of the massive landscape, having nearly all the tools I'll need from almost the beginning, and doing the mini shrine puzzles that are easy to consume while still sometimes providing a challenge.  Its a game that makes you rethink how to play Zelda.  So far, the landscape and map zones almost feel like they're part of the dungeon crawl system, and can actually be puzzles in their own right.  I've only just started with one weekend under my belt in this new game, but it already promises to be one of my favorites!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Great game...In no way would I say one of the best games of all time though. Really was pumped for this plus with the hype up so damn high I was super excited.The story is bland, this link is one of the most unexpressive boring links to date, the vast majority of side quests are borig filler. Most of the characters are underdeveloped or just bland tropes. Zelda comes off well though.The best part of this game is the transversal through the world. I want every open world game let me climb everything.If your buying a switch just for Zelda I would recommend downloading Cemu and trying it there first. It's not nearly as amazing as the reviews said it was. In no was is it a bad game...It's just not exceptional.Still fun though",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

This is an absolute must play game for anyone who has the Nintendo Switch.  The great thing about this game is you get to choose what you want to do.  You can head straight to the main story and beat it or build up your heart levels and inventory before taking on Gannon.  I would highly recommend buying the strategy guide along with this game.  It's much more convenient instead of having to get online for help.  Some shrine quests required that of me.  I followed the walk through in the guide.  After that I started trying to improve inventory levels and heart vessels.  Now that Super Mario Odyssey is out I will put this game away.  I've spent plenty of time on it.  Beautiful graphics and story.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,10,2017,√âtats-Unis

"A must own! If the price came down any lower it wouldn't do the game justice. If your fan of the series, especially Ocarina of Time, this is it. You can lost in this game for hundreds of hours. BOTW is a masterpiece and don't know why I waited two yrs after the original release. Then again I barely just got the switch two yrs after lol.

However, starting the game from scratch makes everything much more manageable and a joy to play! I also bought the DLC stuff which is fun as well. If you like Zelda games, you'll love this one.

"I love this game! The last video game system I owned was the Wii, and I used to play it all the time. I had a great time playing Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword, but in thinking back, those games feel almost elementary to the vastness of this world. I haven't had the opportunity to play this for more than 3 hours at a time yet, but in previous Zelda's I was able to make significant progress in that amount of time. In Breath of the Wild I keep getting sidetracked on other tasks. I haven't been able to put a sizeable dent in the game yet, where in other games I'd probably be 33% done by now. This game will be fun to play for the foreseeable future.The controls, while complex, are relatively intuitive and easy to catch on to.Highly recommended!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I may be biased, as Zelda games have always been my favorite, but I feel pretty safe saying that this is my favorite game ever. Whether you have a few minutes or a few hours to play, there's always something fun to do in this game. The world is massive, and there's always something new to explore. There are familiar elements from other Zelda games, namely some major characters and races. However, the story is told in a refreshing new way, and there are plenty of new gameplay mechanics to make it feel like a whole new world. I was hesitant to buy the Nintendo Switch seeing as this was the only big name game out for it, but even if this is the only game I ever play on this system, I'll feel as though I got my money's worth.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

Not only is there a ton of content, but most of the content has some level of challenge to it, which is nice.  What I like most about this game is there's no one way to play it, like most games.  You have the freedom to play it how you choose.  Overall, this is an excellent game, and definitely worth the money if you are into open-world experiences.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

It's obviously the only reason anyone bought a Nintendo Switch. There isn't a single good first party game out for the Switch besides Zelda. Every other game is literally a pile of horse crap. If you own a switch you literally own this game because there's no other choice of games besides this game. With that being said This is obviously a Master piece!  Mario Kart 8 is coming soon but that's pretty lame because I already bought it for the Wii U. I don't want the same Mario Kart and will most likely avoid this. I Demand Mario Kart Maker since  Nintendo is too lazy to make a proper Mario kart and doesn't have the man power you can just give us our own track creator and be damned with the lazy under powered staff at Nintendo.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm currently on step 5 of my 12 step program to curb my addiction to this game.But seriously, this is a fantastic game and merits the label of Adventure game. This isn't your grandpa's Legends of Zelda. This is far beyond the previous titles of this series. It requires more effort to progress in the game and find everything, but it is so rewarding to spend the time looking for melee weapons, food, bows, shields, and a host of other materials. The fact that weapons can wear out and break adds a little more realism, which bothered me at first, but later I saw it as an opportunity to swap out for new or different weapons. It can be frustrating when something breaks during a fight but it's not too bad to switch out normal weapons quickly.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"This game starts strong and appears to blend open world gameplay with the Zelda universe quite well, but very quickly you will realize all is not as it seems, and the game is quite lacking as far as a Zelda game goes.Dungeons are BLAND.  Seriously.  Same colors, simple puzzles, and the bosses at the end of these woefully short places are almost as bad.  Who remembers Skyward Sword, or even Twilight Princess?  Clearly, not the developers. There are only 4 dungeons on top of that.  Skyward Sword had like 6 or 7, AND THEY WERE BIGGER and took waaaay longer to explore.  Ganon (the main villain) has no personality, unlike other games.  He doesn't utter a single word in the entire game.  He was such a good character in previous games, and they just left him alone.  You see him a few times during the course of the game, but wow....It seems to me that they spent most of their time and energy on creating a vibrant and detailed world to explore, and they totally nailed that.  The game is enjoyable to play in this regard.  Exploring for shrines (puzzle rooms used to power you up) is fun, and doing random side quests, or just riding your horse around.  I give this game a 3 because it's a decent game, but if you are expecting a Zelda game, don't hold your breath xD",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2018,√âtats-Unis

While that game will probably be my all-time favorite video game I have ever played, this comes in a close second. All of the other Zelda games have fallen far below the level of these two games.

"There's a number of things I could go on about such as it's freedom to play and explore however you want, the variety of amazing weapons, clothing, or the story that is actually really well done. Going into The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild I was taken away by the amazing visuals and sheer depth of the world. After starting to uncover some of the plot I was excited and somewhat concerned as to how the plot would be affected if sequence were broken. Now that I completed the main story after a long 60+ hours I can say without a doubt that Breath of the Wild is the most complete Zelda game I've ever played.

I just finished my first playthrough, including completing all the shrines and around 300 koroks. Anyone who says the game world is empty hasn't looked very closely. Yes, at first it seems like there is a lot of open space, but there are secrets and quests to find all over the place, you just need to find them. Hunting for koroks has turned into one of my favorite things to do! They are EVERYWHERE if you take the time to find them.

There are many different types of quests all scattered around the world just waiting for you.The game itself is absolutely gorgeous!

The first time I got struck by lightning scared the hell out of me but I couldn't help but admire that it was thing that could happen and that there were triggers for it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
My son loves this game! The graphics are great and the actual game play look amazing! Lots of reading throughout the game is the only thing my little one doesn't care for but that's not a negative for me. Your little ones will love this game!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I have played the game for more than 55 hours now and I have had indescribable fun during these hours exploring the world of Hyrule and to be honest I have never played a Zelda game before but this is a game that was so much worth picking up. It feels like even after playing it for so long I have completed just half the story , now some people might like games that are long but personally I like games that are just about 10 to 20 hours long and that's why I gave it the 4 stare rating but it is arguably the best looking and the best game on the Nintendo switch.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2019,Inde
"Bought the Switch for my son, but we play Zelda BOTW together. We have made it to Hateno, which I'm guessing is less than a tenth of the overall game. Let me just say that it is insanely good. It is epic. It is like all the imaginings I had as a kid playing dice RPGs. The freedom of being able to explore such a large, rich, intricate and gorgeous world is fantastic. Climbing mountains, gliding down into charming villages, galloping through open countryside on horseback, running along wooded trails, hunting, foraging and cooking, dodging thunderstorms, conquering shrines. Even just gazing at the landscape from the top of a tower is just awesome.This game is so good we have to set timers to remind us to take a break.If only we could just climb in ;-)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,5,2018,√âtats-Unis
"As a casual zelda gamer, I always take all the perfect scores these titles seem to get with a grain of salt, there have been some times (windwaker, a link between worlds) where zelda games feel authentic and natural, this is one of these times.straying away from the usual zelda formula, serves this game just right. the open world is huge and there's lot to do, the physics are amazing, and the shrines can be fun and challenging.this game takes cues from Zelda itself, skyrim and even shadow of the colossus, what's more impressive, it makes it work in an amazing way.in a few words, this game deserves all the accolades it's been receiving, it may not be the best game of all time, but it sure comes close :D",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"My husband LOVES this game!  He originally bought it for our WiiU, beat it on regular difficulty, sold the WiiU for a Switch and bought the game again, and has started over.  This game has given him hours and weeks of fun.The graphics are beautiful, and the enemies are tricky, which is appreciated, as he can‚Äôt just fly through the quests.The only frustration I‚Äôve seen him express is in finding all of the hidden temples.  The beeping noise leads you on quite a goose chase at times, and climbing long distances is slow and tedious, but he hates to give up and look at walkthroughs.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,5,2019,√âtats-Unis

"There are no words I can write in this box to live up to how awesome this game is. It‚Äôs not a hard game, it‚Äôs not even a complicated game. Nevertheless it‚Äôs an amazingly well executed game. It should be the first game you own for Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
This game is amazing. I haven't finished more than 25% of it and if the game abruptly ended now I would still give it five stars and put it in my top 3 games of all time. When I'm finished it could possibly be literally the best game I have ever played.Early in the game you look off in the far distance at your new world and the game basically just lets you go where ever you want. I chose a particularly interesting looking mountain that looked ridiculously large. The mountain was so far away and it took so long to get there. When I finally got to the top I realized that there was more map/world beyond the mountain than I had traversed to get to the mountain. IT BLEW MY MIND!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Hasta el momento el mejor Zelda que he jugado (aunque puede ser una opini√≥n no tan popular) es el Ocarine of Time; √©ste tiene la capacidad de que se convierta en mi favorito.Llevo aproximadamente 20 horas de juego, y puedo decir que ha sido el Zelda mas retador que he jugado. Es complejo obtener armas, derrotar enemigos sencillos (no he llegado con ninguno ""grande""), link puede cansarse al nadar (ya no nadas de manera infinita) y tiene tanta atenci√≥n al detalle que inclusive la lluvia no te permite escalar por que te resbalas y los rayos persiguen los objetos met√°licos (tienes que deshacerte de tu espadda si hay tormenta el√©ctrica)El tama√±o del mapa es incre√≠ble, el mas grande jam√°s creado. Tienes la ventaja que conforme vas descubriendo punto en el mapa, generas lugares para teletrasportarte; sin embargo, a veces no es recomendable, pues el juego est√° plagado de misiones alternas que dar√°n muchas horas de diversi√≥n.Una excelente compra y mis felicitaciones a los desarrolladores.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,5,2017,Mexique
"I love this game even more than I expected. I haven't touched any of my other Switch games since I bought it. I love how you can play it to your own tastes - fighting monsters or avoiding them, exploring the wilderness or sticking to roads, completing shrines or ignoring them, completing main objectives or putting them off. I alternate between these strategies, so I never get bored. I thought this was a little pricey, but now I realize it will give me months of entertainment, I couldn't recommend this game enough.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I have to admit that this is one of my children's favorite video games. I thought it was a straightforward quest type game, but they beat it once, and then went back to recover all the memories to beat it again. We've had endless fights over how much they played, and I'm only grateful that I purchased it during the summer so that they could at least go once through before school started. I've used it as a bribe for regular dog walks, and other chores, so I guess it's not all negative. Definitely lives up to the hype.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,9,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I get stuck in the weeds of side missions and minor quests. But whereas some large world games leave me lost and bored, this one remains captivating even on my second run. Sometimes I wished I'd go right for the main story and just beat divine beasts in succession, but finding the shrine quests and side missions can be so rewarding and fun. I love this game and can't wait to wait a year or two and play it again.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"It flits between boring and aggregating and neither of those in a good way, like some games are built with those specific things in mind, butt they are very much the only 2 things i get from this. It's has been the most disappointing and possible worst game I played in 2017.Open world games, RPGs, fantasy story-telling, these are the things my gaming catalogue is made of, i have some sports in there, the odd FPS, but generally speaking this game SHOULD have been my bread and butter, it wasn't, the world doesn't make sense or feel real, the combat is built for fighting individuals but routinely has you fighting groups of enemies, the puzzles were fun at first but quickly started running out of new ideas and often just introduced things you would never think of (like hitting a boulder with an arrow to roll it, my bad for not immediately assuming a large heavy rock could be so easily swayed by a tiny piece of metal on a bending stick). I hate the weapon breaking mechanic, whomever thought of it needs to stop making games and start thinking about a career in water torture applications. The characters in the game are boring or much like the world they inhabit just don't feel real the way they're presented, now understand by real i don't mean ""realistic"" like a modern batman movie, but the world doesn't work, the world is almost completely empty apart from occasional enemies, and yet when you find settlements people seem to be living very normal unhampered lives, one guy has even opened up a clothes dying store, these are not the villages of a world under siege by the forces of evil. They talk about how the world is filled with monsters attacking everybody, and yet there's inns and stables just sitting between some trees, 200 years from an enemy camp, protected by a guy looking for recipes and someone cooking an apple. The world doesn't work, and the people in it don't seem real because of it.That's enough, i hate the game, it's just plain bad, it's quite pretty? there, a nice way to round things off.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I'm pretty skeptical these days when it comes to open world games. They're all starting to feel the same. So I was hesitant when I bought Breath of the Wild. Fortunately, I was caught by surprise. Not only does it have a new take on the Zelda series, it has a new take on open world. I genuinely enjoyed exploring this world. Many times while playing I let my curiosity take me away from the quest lines, for hours at a time. Its a world filled with creativity and I applaud the developers. Despite the redundancy of looking for shrines, the puzzles keep the hunt fresh. The world is designed wonderfully, add in the stunning soundtrack this makes the perfect game. A must have for everyone, no matter who you are.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I'm not really into games where I have to fight. I'm more of an Animal Crossing player. A few years back I played Fantasy Life which has fighting along with gathering and crafting and I loved that game. I once tried Ocarina of Time but never got into it and only played briefly and ended up selling the game. But Breath of the Wild grabbed me right away and I became pretty much obsessed with the game.. I'm trying to stretch the game out a while while waiting for the first DLC. If anyone is on the fence about getting this game, don't hesitate any longer. The games guides you a bit in the beginning as you learn what to do, so if you're like me and aren't into ""fighting"" games, don't worry.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"AMAZING. I love the Legend of Zelda series, and this is my favorite by far. Ocarina of Time will always hold a special place in my heart, but this game is just wonderful and makes great use of the different functionalities of the Nintendo Switch. It's a very balanced game that's great for beginners but has plenty to do to challenge experienced gamers.The graphics are amazing too! Not my personal preference for art style, but I still admire the quality of it. I even restarted my game so that I could re-watch the first few cut scenes, like when Link first leaves the Shrine of Awakening and when he activates the first Sheikah tower LOL. It was just that good!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,4,2018,√âtats-Unis

"The game of its generation. Loving detail and beautiful, artful graphics. It gloriously smashes the previous Zelda traditions of being linear and saying ‚Äúno, not yet‚Äù or ‚Äúyou need this item to do this task‚Äù with the concept of ‚Äúgo anywhere and do anything as long as your creativity allows‚Äù. A beautiful open world, a soundtrack that is masterful and a quest for a master sword to free a princess who is fighting Ganon.

"I don't know if it will end up in my personal favorites, but I can respect it as probably one of the best games ever developed. Deceptively simple in the opening hours, the layers and layers of detail and impressive mechanics make themselves more apparent the longer you play. This is the 3D version of the NES original where they give you a pointy stick and send you into the world to live and die. There's no little fairy or talking hat telling you what to do or how to play.That being said it's not perfect. Some of the motion control puzzles are nearly broken, and parts of the map feel a little too spread out and barren. The writing and voice acting for the dialogue is also pretty abysmal.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I haven't played the legend of zelda since 1986! I read a lot of good things about this game and honestly, I'm blown away! It's terribly addicting and there's so much to do! I've been playing this nonstop on my switch since (I got it on March 2nd) I guess I would be considered a newbie since i'm new to this but its not hard as I see people complaining about how the swords and weapons don't last that much. I didn't have a problem because I was side tracked doing other missions and going to shrines so I collected good stuff.There is so much you can do in this game. I don't have any complaints just that is seriously addicting",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
It is very rare a game lives up to its hype because everybody has a different taste and prefer something different in gameplay. I am one of the picky ones. I have a lot of dislikes in video games than likes but this game was sooo awesome. I have put in about 70 hours and am no where close to done. This open world experience is beautiful crafted and it‚Äôll be a shame to not give it a try. And this is totally worth the $60,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,1,2020,√âtats-Unis

"This is my review for as far as I got into the game. Game is great and there is plenty to do and explore in game; however, it has some drawbacks. One, when you are using your bow, it lacks lock-on...which make it highly inconvenient when you are in a tight spot with a difficult foe. Two, when you are using your melee weapons, it is highly advised that you have top notch weapons in your arsenal since they wear out after several hits. Three, the shrine locator used to finding shrines lacks direction...which makes finding a shrine difficult since you have to monitor your stamina. Overall, game is great and is definitely not for average gamers; however, lack of certain things make playing it a chore.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I don't normally spring for the next installment of The Legend of Zelda, but this got my attention because it looked like a good fresh take on a Legend of Zelda game, so I got the Switch when I could and bought this. Well it amazed me, the world is so immersive, the art style is amazing, the controls feel great(yes I like motion controls for the bow) and the game mechanics were fun and natural. If I had to be honest, if you want to play this and are almost flipping coins to decide on the Switch, I'd say go for it, the Switch is a great Home-Portable console and this game alone has enough fun content and secrets to find to make the investment well worth the ~$400.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is the best  of all the Zelda games that I have played so far in my life! I love the vast open world that is available, the armor options for both link and his horses, the fact that you have to cook meals to survive, and all the side quests available giving plenty of things to do while you‚Äôre just out exploring outside of the main quests... they did an amazing job creating this one!!!

I can't believe how detailed and huge the world inside this tiny little card is. There are a lot of ways to waste time, but I've never found anything as interesting or satisfying as this. Sure, you could start a meth habit, but this is relatively cheap compared to that despite being just as effective at causing you to ignore friends and work. And does meth keep your brain occupied with puzzles? No, it fries your brain.

The graphics are amazing and the open world of Hyrule is gargantuan!!! Everything about this game is so good I can confidently say that this title makes the Switch worth purchasing all by itself. Even when the main campaign is done I know I will be going right back to the beginning and playing it again and again. Nintendo made the right move in hinging the success of the Switch on this title for launch. Buy it, you will not regret it for a second!!! On a scale of 1-10 I rate this game a 100!!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is by far the best game I have ever played.  I have been away from the Nintendo world for a while now so I thought I should get back in and see how the newest system and games are.  I have had so much fun with this game.  The world is huge and there is so much to do.  There are challenging puzzles that make you think and when you think you can't figure it out you do and it is so satisfying.  Everything is so well balanced.  Did I mention how big this world is?  This game will help the new Nintendo Switch get off the ground.  This is just a great game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Drop the Zelda brand name, and you still have one of the best open world gaming experiences ever at the time of this writing. Future games will be modeled after this design and a great opener of a launch title for the Nintendo Switch.The game is amazing.... from its intense moments of combat against huge intimidating monsters that will kill you in one swing to the quiet moments watching the sunset as the grass wisps gently in the wind has left me in awe. No fairies pestering you where to go from there, just explore and take in the world of Hyrule at your own pace,I haven't sought out the first dungeon, and I don't care... it's a gorgeous world to get lost in.Highly recommended.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

Well this time they blew those expectations up with a hand grenade.This game is by far one of the most expansive, most engaging, most beautiful, most thoughtful, most wandering, most iconic, most in depth games I have ever played. I am almost 200 hours in and still finding new areas, new enemies, new shrines, and smiling every step of the way.It's also very compelling as it has loads for a completionist to do, but also has quick stories and main quest lines for the type that want to plow through.

The Wild in Breath of the Wild is the main character of this game. The detail of the natural world, the physics system, the sound design, etc. all make this a world you want to live in.The only drawback is that the plot sometimes gets in the way of enjoying a peaceful afternoon strolling through the woods. The world is so nice that I wish I didn't have to be Link and destroy Ganon again.

Would be nice if there was a way to turn this off or make some items indestructible. Kind of ruins immersion when you find a Zora sword ""made of a non rusting alloy"" breaks apart in 2 battles.Feels like I'm always fighting the camera.

The graphics are beautiful and the controls are good.It's one of those games that you start playing and next thing you know 3 hours are gone.I also love there is no need for a online connection, so many games were going that way.Buy a switch just for it, it really is that good!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This game is really great! Every time I pick up the switch, I'm not willing to put it down! I have defeated four mythical beasts, and now I don‚Äôt want to go to the castle because I don‚Äôt want to end this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
It was a birthday gift for my grandson.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
Es un juego muy entretenido y completo. No hab√≠a jugado algo similar. Totalmente recomendado tanto para los quebja han jugado alg√∫n Zelda como para los que lo hacen por primera vez.Quiz√° ser√° un poco diferente a lo que ha sacado Zelda respecto a las mazmorras ya conocidas en otras entregas pero es sin duda maravilloso.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,6,2021,Mexique
"Master Mode:  ActiveHUD Mode: ProWolf Amiibo: SummonedI walk this world with no map, wandering from town to town...  and it's the damndest thing, everyone keeps confusing me for some ancient hero.  Oh well, that horizon is calling to me again.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Es un juego bastante bueno que te puede ofrecer muchas horas de exploraci√≥n. En una Switch lite se puede jugar sin ning√∫n problema, sin embargo, hay algunas partes como el bosque kolog en las cuales se perciben un baj√≥n en los fps por unos instantes. No afecta a la jugabilidad realmente pero es un detalle a tener en cuenta.Si eres fan de Zelda es una compra obligada.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2021,Mexique
"This is the single greatest video game to come from Nintendo, ever. It should pretty much be bundled with every Switch because I cannot imagine anyone owning a Switch without this game. I am a Zelda fan to the core, and this game did not disappoint me at all. Sure, they changed the way dungeons work and made them less intense, but this game is about more than just completing dungeons and defeating Ganon. The amount of detail this game has still impresses me after putting 200+ hours into it.I know this may be heresy, but this game rivals (and in my opinion, surpasses) even Ocarina of Time and A Link to The Past. It's that good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Llego el paquete en tiempo y forma a lo estipulado lo que hubiese deseado es que me llegara la consola antes que el juego pero bueno solo 2 d√≠as m√°s de espera por la demanda de la excelente oferta; ah si,  llego en buenas condiciones, en cuanto al juego no se puede decir m√°s de lo que no se haya publicado solo decir que cualquier juego de la saga de zelda es meritorio de jugarse, es l√≥gico que a trav√©s del tiempo cada t√≠tulo vaya mejorando en relaci√≥n a lo anterior ya que las consolas evolucionan incorporando nuevas mejoras de verse y jugarse as√≠ que la versatilidad que se brinda en el switch es lo que ese extra, en cuanto historia no se puede esperar m√°s o diferencias y si las quieres ver pues creo que tienes que cambiar de saga, no lo creen? As√≠ que juegalo y disfr√∫tenlo, diversion y entretenimiento garantizado si te gusta este tipo y m√°s si sigues la saga desde sus inicios.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,11,2017,Mexique
The game was packaged well and arrived sealed and undamaged.The game itself is amazing! Beautiful graphics and it has a pretty strong storyline throughout the game. The final ending was kinda disappointing compared to the rest of the game which was a masterpiece. I spent over 150 hours playing it and still probably only touched half the content before beating it. If you're a completionist this will keep you busy for a long time.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I never was much a fan of Zelda 3D games in the past. I usually prefer 2D games such as A Link to the Past and the newer game, A Link Between Worlds, which were fantastic. I decided to give this game a try since it was the best option to buy when I purchased my Switch. I can't believe how addicted I am to this game. I have logged in 65 plus hours and I am barely half way done with the game, and honestly, I don't ever want it to end. I have purchased Persona 5 and I haven't even opened it. This game is this good. Do yourself a favor and at least play it once in your life.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"The best open world game I've played. I mean that in this way: virtually everything I've tried has worked out in one way or another. See apples in a tree? You can climb it and get them. It just works. Seamless open world for me, with great load times on any transitions.Difficulty scales harder than any previous Zelda game in ages. It feels like a modern take on the original Legend of Zelda, perhaps with a touch of the flavor of Link to the Past. I've played for hours and I've been simply exploring and slowly uncovering story. The world is vast, but it isn't empty. It is well designed with little touches of content for your to discover all over the place.  A real treat.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Perfect conditions and sealed. The games works perfectly fine. An amzing experience. One of the best Legend of Zelda (after Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and A Link to the Past).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,8,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game is enormous in scope, has a moving story, and the land of Hyrule is stunningly beautiful despite (or perhaps because of) being 100 years after a devastating cataclysm. Granted, a few of the challenges and fights might be too much for some casual gamers to handle (pity the casual player who encounters his/her first Lynel...), and 100-percenting the game can take a VERY long time, but overall it's a splendid game worth playing.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,10,2019,√âtats-Unis

"When I heard people calling it the best zelda ever I thought it was just a hyped game being called that way by kids who didn't experience the release of ocarina of time back in the day. I decided to try it out and check for myself.I have to say this is on par with arguably the best game ever (ocarina of time). Just the scale of the game, the art, attention to details, things to do and changes to the franchise. They could have played it safe and go with the original formula, and it would still sell. They risked changing and possibly saved a console by doing so.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Wowed. Just wowed. I am not a hardcore gamer but I couldn't put this one down. Haven grown up with Ocarina of time on N64 I was curious to see how this would connect, and boy did it connect!Hours and hours of progressive gameplay that all leads to a final showdown with calamity Ganon. I appreciate the way you have to understand the game, from what foods to cook, weapons to use, shrines to unlock and yes- the side missions that really give you an edge when you need it.Money well spent. Bravo Nintendo!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is an open world, and it is very fun to explore.  You are suppose to save Zelda again, this time she woke you from 100 years of sleep.  There are a lot of side quest.  These are optional, but do add to the story and gives you time to explore the world.  The tutorial gives you the chance to learn the game mechanics so you are not thrown into a situation not knowing how to play.  This is a really nice action adventure game and is a great addition for any Zelda lover.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,1,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is the best Switch game out there so far. And one of the best games I've ever played. The map is astoundingly large. There are quests within quests, and it is very open - it is the player's choice as to how much they actually want to do before accomplishing the main goal of the game, and if you wanted a real challenge, you could probably go straight to the main boss, though I wouldn't recommend it unless you are supremely confident in your combat skills. There are hours and hours of things to do within this game and I guarantee you will not get bored with this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,5,2018,√âtats-Unis
"A gorgeous addition to the series!  Whether you have played every game before or never touched the game(yes, even those of you who think Zelda is the guy...), this game is enjoyable.  There is an abundance of content and very minimal bugs even at launch which goes to show how much Nintendo still cares to release a finished product unlike some other games that launch with a plethora of bugs.  While I personally played this title for the Switch, I am sure that the game is just as lovely on the WiiU!The only thing to beware of is that it can be difficult to put the controller down and take a break or go to work!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I'd heard nothing but great things about this game. In my opinion, it's okay. High production values, large world with a lot to explore and do -  but there isn't much point in doing so. No XP (experience points) when killing monsters. All you possibly get is a new weapon or ammo to replace the weapon and ammo you just lost by killing the monsters. Shrines are the only way to build your character. All other exploration is pointless. It is fun - which, I suppose, is the main point in games. But there really is no incentive to explore the world. I was disappointed.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"In the first grade, my cousin sold his golden cartridge of the first Zelda game to young me. I don‚Äôt remember how much I had to pay him. He should have just given me the game. It was worthless to him and his brother who went on to buy every sports game that came out every year for snes and genesis. What was I saying.... Oh yes, I‚Äôm very old and have loved Zelda games most of my life. This one is the best yet. My wife has never liked a Zelda game until this one, which she loves.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,5,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I do not overstate the fact that this is one of the most incredible games I have ever played, and has been a constant source of addiction since I have purchased it.I have never seen a game that offers such rich rewards for exploration, that builds a story one day at a time, one piece at a time, so compellingly. It is a game that makes you think, strategize every action that you take. It is a game that can be so realistic, while allowing players to immerse themselves in its game world. I absolutely love this game, and truthfully it was worth the purchase of the Switch.Buy this game, it is an experience unlike any other.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

good game and price,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Possibly the best Zelda game I‚Äôve ever played. It really brings things back to the way the first Zelda was, as now the story and your obligation to see it through as the hero take the backseat (not entirely, though) while your own curiosity and willingness to explore drive the game forward. I bought this game back in November and I‚Äôm still not done with it.  There‚Äôs so much to do! I‚Äôd recommend this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2020,√âtats-Unis

"Beautiful game.  It is challenging.  There are captivating cut-scenes and a satisfying ending.  It also has excellent replay value as my son discovered all the downloadable content which pertain to it.  As a father of two boy gamers, I can say this game gave me lots of credibility as a gift-giver.  In conclusion, we are 100% satisfied.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,6,2020,√âtats-Unis

"This is a great game. I love open world games, and I love Zelda games, so this purchase was a no brainer. I've put in over 24 hours worth of play time and still haven't explored everything or completed the main objective/storyline (having said that, I'm an explorer and have completed many side objectives along the way, but still). So you really won't get bored with this game very quickly. Graphics are great for an open world game. Honestly love everything about this game. Definite must have/play.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,9,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I absolutely love this game. It is so much fun once I got it I couldn‚Äôt stop playing it. Out of all of the Zelda games I‚Äôve played (All of them) this is the best one by far. The graphics are amazing and there are so many things for you to do in this game. I highly recommend getting this games if you like Zelda games, like free roam games, or if you just want another game on your Nintendo switch. All in all this was a great purchase.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I normally don't write reviews on video games as I'd prefer to beat the game first, but this Zelda game is simply amazing. It's great to see how far Zelda has come along. This game is great and there is an amazing amount of things to do in the game that will keep you busy for hours and hours on end. You can choose to follow the main story or get lost in the immersive world with plenty of side quests and shrines (temples) to solve. I'd recommend it to anyone who is a Zelda fan as you'll enjoy it the moment you pick up the game.This game is a must own for all Nintendo Switch owners!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"This is the best game that I've played this year.  My nephew let me borrow his Switch, at first, I played Mario Odyssey (lots of fun) but I grew a little bored after getting 150 moons.  Then, I played Zelda:  BOTW, and 86 hours later, I've just freed 3 ""Divine Beast,' and... Before you know it,  my nephew wanted it back because he was going to visit Europe.  So I bought a Switch and bought Zelda:  BOTW.  This game is so great, I don't mind starting over again.  I love this game.

"I love Zelda games. This one is different than any other I‚Äôve played. I have spent probably 30 hours playing this game and 27 of them have been wondering around. I have still yet to come across any dungeons, there‚Äôs more side challenges than anything, controllers/views are difficult to get used to. There just really isn‚Äôt much action. It‚Äôs also a pain because you don‚Äôt get hearts when you kill an enemy, rather you have to get food and eat it or you can cook to make recipes that do different things. Been playing as much as I have and I still have only gotten one piece of the heart so I only have 4 hearts. You can fall too far or get hit once and it kills you. I‚Äôm just not a fan. I keep playing hoping that something exciting will happen but it hasn‚Äôt yet. It‚Äôs hard to get into. With twilight princess, skyward sword, links awakening, and pretty much all other Zelda games, I couldn‚Äôt put them down. This one I feel like I have to force myself to play.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,5,2021,√âtats-Unis

Cuando era ni√±o jugu√© el Zelda del primer Nintendo y me gust√≥ mucho, mucho m√°s que Mario y otros  juegos. Desde entonces no hab√≠a vuelto a jugar ninguna versi√≥n de Zelda, aunque de reojo hab√≠a visto alguna versi√≥n ya con gr√°ficos muy sofisticados. √âsta definitivamente est√° extraordinaria; totalmente la recomiendo!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,1,2021,Mexique
"It is difficult to say something about this game when so many others pretty much did it all. But I have to say it anyway. This game is incredible. I have been playing it just for a week, and I feel like this is probably the best game I have ever played. It features a huge open world that you can explore however you whant. You're gonna spend hours just riding your horse admiring the beautiful landscapes and searching for secrets lying all over Hyrule. And if you want, you can follow the main quest storyline and go straight to the end. It suits every kind of gameplay. The Switch couldn't have had a better launch title.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I don‚Äôt really know what to say that does this game justice. I can tell you I basically bought the switch mostly because I heard this game was off the chain, but I intended to get other games too. That‚Äôs on hold now because I can‚Äôt stomach playing anything else now. A moment spent not playing this game is a moment wasted. I‚Äôm not even a LoZ junkie‚Äîbefore this, I‚Äôve only ever played a little bit of Ocarina of time‚Äîbut I‚Äôm fully engrossed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,10,2019,√âtats-Unis

"As the title says, I haven't played a Zelda game since the Gameboy days. Never did play any of the N64 games either. That said, I've loved this game and haven't been able to put it down. It's a huge world that is actually fun to explore - too many open world games focus on quantity over quality. The combat is great even if it's challenging sometimes, and maybe even because of it. I'm over 25 hours into the game and have only explored a portion of the world so far, so I'll definitely update this review when I finish it. In the mean time, I'd recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Easily a new favorite.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent, excellent game! My only other LoZ experience was on the NES, and this has my attention just as that did. It's extremely fun, I never want to put it down. And there's so much to do! The side quests aren't boring like most side quests are in RPG's and MMO's, the puzzles are tricky and leave me feeling accomplished when I figure them out, the main story is gradually challenging, the enemies are scaled based on area but even if you run into higher baddies, dispatching them only takes a few more minutes. I've played countless hours of Elder Scrolls games, and this gives that vibe with a nice LoZ & Nintendo spin. Excellent game, excellent experience.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I've played so many games, but very few Legend of Zelda games. Having only played the original NES Legend of Zelda, I came in not expecting much. I was so pleasantly surprised. I love this game, and will probably play it again, even after sinking hundreds of hours in already! If you are looking for the best single player game on Switch, I would argue this one is it. If you need a game with a sort of ""younger-sibling multiplayer"", I would recommend Mario Odyssey instead. If you are able to get both games though, I would call both the essential Switch games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2018,√âtats-Unis

"Can't put this game down... the more I've played the more addicted I've become.  This game does a fantastic job of making you want to explore without holding your hand, despite the enormous map I never feel overwhelmed.  75 hrs in and I'm still having a blast finding shrines, collecting seeds, and upgrading gear.Update: Finally defeated Gannon; 160 hrs play time, 120 shrines, 327 korok seeds, all 76 side quest complete.  Final thoughts, the game was incredible and deserves the high praise.  I thought the ending cut scene left a lot to be desired, but despite that this was one of the most addicting and enjoyable games I've played in years.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Amazing game that lasts for over 160 hours of gameplay! This game is a true masterpiece, with hours of side activities and exploration just waiting for you. The art style is magnificent and is very pleasing to the eye. The new direction the game takes, going away from older Zelda game linearity, and allows true exploration. This is one of the very best games i have ever played in my entire life. I cannot wait to learn anything about the sequel.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is legitimately one of the best games I have had the pleasure of playing. I loved all of the legend of zelda series, and this game did not disappoint whatsoever. Its free roaming, choose your own path, play at your own pace style is perfect. You cannot beat the various quests, skills, things to do. I'm going on 80+ hours and still have plenty to do. Cannot wait until the next expansion comes out as well. It was honestly worth getting the Nintendo Switch just for this game alone. The voice acting, the cutscenes, the graphics are to die for. Seriously I can't believe you're still reading this. BUY IT ALREADY!!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Excelente compra. Es altamente adictivo. Los gr√°ficos excelentes. Al principio te sientes s√∫per novato en comparaci√≥n a otros juegos de la saga, pero despu√©s de unas 10 horas de juego uno se siente como pez en el agua. Lo he jugado y terminado ya 3 veces seguidas y cada vez algo nuevo resulta.  100% recomendado.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,5,2021,Mexique
"This is my all time favorite game. I have played over 75 hours.  There is so much to do and a lot to explore. The combat system is perfect and everything seems so realistic. It plays great on the tv with only a few occasional frame rate drops that did not hinder gameplay. I haven't spent too much time with it in tablet mode, but the hour or so I did spend on tablet mode was  very similar to tv mode, with no noticable differences. Even though there were a few frame rate drops, they were not douring fights or main events so they didn't affect gameplay, so this is a perfect game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

I've only played the game for about 30 minutes and I was stuck on it the open world is great and the switch makes it even more awesome since it's on the go. I'm yet to explore even %5 of the game and I can say this is going to be a fun game for Zelda fans who have played all the other games and anyone who has never picked up Zelda once before  will still be able to enjoy the adventure of link. I have prime so it's definitely worth it to get it for $54 (tax included) the same day I ordered it save money and time going to the store.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Where do I even start?I've played about 10 hours of this game so far and I'm pretty sure I can go for 90 more hours and not notice the time pass.I'll start though by saying that if you don't like open world games, you probably won't like this either. It's got great structure to it, but it doesn't ever pretend like it's a game ""on rails"" like Call of Duty. You very much choose your own adventure.I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say that the mechanics are fun, the learning curve is easy, and it looks great. If you're looking for a game to play for the next few months, this is for you.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

At 100 hours of play roughly I finally wrapped it up to a point I felt satisfied in concluding my adventure.  I think I may have to go as far as to make the claim this may be my favorite game ever made (and since no divorce papers have been filed yet I may go back in for one more run through)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

This game has some of the best physics in any game ever, and the amount of little details they packed into the huge gorgeous  world is amazing. I‚Äôm only 30 hours in, and can tell you this absolutely deserved it‚Äôs Game of the Year title. Beautiful.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I recently purchased the Nintendo Switch version of the game ""The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild"" and I must say I am very pleased with it!Keep in mind I haven't played it for very long, ..but this game appears to be simply awesome!Breath of the Wild definitely looks like a game that I am going to be playing for a long, long time to come.  The sheer size and depth of the world (and it's gameplay) seems incredible.As a huge fan of the Zelda series I was hoping this game would be something special.. and that most definitely seems to be the case!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I love classic Zelda. I'm a true nerd by nature, nit picking every detail of anything LOZ. To be fair, I really like the game, it's a LOZ version of Elderscrolls (Skyrim/Oblivion). It's very diverse and fun. I could easily play it for hours. However, it is far from classic Zelda. There are almost no classic themes throughout the game. Game play is completely different from the classics we all know and love, game play feels more like Elderscrolls. The main quests have no definitive order. You pretty much go and do as you please. If you love classic Zelda, keep an open mind. If you love gaming, it's a must try!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"One of the greatest games of all time. If you haven't played this yet, you are living under a rock or have piss poor taste in games. Period.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I really enjoy it, its a beautiful and incredible game",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,11,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game is totally worth the hype, and sometimes almost feels TOO big. As a very casual adult gamer who grew up playing the Zelda franchise and just happened to snag the Switch so my girlfriend and I could play MarioKart, I found Breath of the Wild to be an incredibly fun addition to our tiny game library. I find myself playing for hours just roaming around and discovering things, which I rarely feel is very rewarding in other games. I don't think I'll ever beat this game because of its size, but for now it's fun playing the newest chapter in the franchise (and, on the plane while traveling!).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Quem puder compra. √â simplesmente maravilhoso ter o privil√©gio de jogar ZELDA. Todos os ZELDAS s√£o bons, mas esse √© para ficar de queixo ca√≠do. √â caro ? Muito caro mas vale a pena cada centavo do investimento.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,9,2021,Br√©sil
This did not feel like a zelda game to me all the great thing about zelda I feel they got rid of like temple now instead you get these little shrines that feel like a nuisance having to look for. The there is the beast temples which are short and boring. Then there is the weapon system stuff breaks and you have to keep stopping in the middle of a fight to pick another dam weapon. So much empty space and no exciting bosses. I'm a huge legend of Zelda fan main reason bought the switch just for this game did not live up to my expectations.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
I bought this game for my 6 year old son and he loves it.  What I never imagined is my fiance playing this day and night!  She absolutely loves it - and I never knew she was a gamer.  I've watched them play on several occasions and can't believe where Zelda has gone since I played the one's when I was a kid.  Graphics and game play are stunning.  They've had it for a couple months and are not even close to finishing the game so you get you money's worth.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
fast shipping and I love the game. not so much as a scuff on anything üòç,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,10,2021,√âtats-Unis
Product is good....Arrived early too...It arrived even before my switch was delivered üòÇ,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2022,Inde
"Easily one of the best games I've ever played.  The details are amazing for an open world this large.  It really feels alive when you can interact with everything.  Very immersive experience from start to finish.  The switch has the best control scheme with the tilt sensor, which becomes useful on some quests and in combat.  Worth every penny spent and every minute played.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
Me divertido y entretenido mucho con este juego,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,11,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I haven't beat this yet, but it's great so far. Graphics are pretty cool. I have a couple gripes. The programming for riding a horse could be improved. Unlike riding in Horizon Zero Dawn the horses in this game don't seem to respond very quickly. Also, the programming for the mouths of characters should be better.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Such a great game, I have a hard time pulling myself away from it (as someone who really only gets into games a couple of times a year). If you have ADD you're going to be playing this for a long time. I start the game intending to do one thing, then see something in the distance that catches my attention, and a couple of hours later I didn't do what I intended to when I started, but still had a blast and accomplished other things. I've put a little over 15 hours in since release and haven't even seen the first ""real"" dungeon yet. This is going to keep my occupied for a while!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"All I can say is that this game is amazing, very well made, beautiful graphics. SO MUCH time and work went into this game and it is obvious, because it‚Äôs just so good. Grew up with siblings playing the game and I never did, and now I‚Äôm finally getting to play it myself. I love that there are specific ‚Äúcheckpoints‚Äù and what not, but that the game is also completely free and you can practically do whatever you want. Love love love it!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
Such An amazing game. You really get your money‚Äôs worth diving into this massive work of art. The graphics are beautiful and the nature & wildlife of this game are stunning. 120 shrines to find and solve and hundreds of Korok seeds to find among so many other mechanics. I recommend using Zelda dungeon for their guides for this game when you get stuck. 10/10 Must Play,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Al principio cre√≠ que exageraban con el mame de que est√© era un juego 10/10, pero desde que inicias se nota la calidad que le pusieron, desde que inicias te da la libertad de hacer lo que quieras hasta cierto punto, despu√©s de conquistar las 4 principales habilidades y entrar de lleno al mundo abierto literalmente puedes hacer lo que quieras, ya sea farmear cosas o buscar armas y escudos, es simplemente perfecto.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,12,2020,Mexique
"Definitely a classic - it's on the top of almost everyone's 2017 game list. It's vast in scope, both in terms of environments to explore, and in terms of gameplay possibilities - abilities, items, ways to use things, mini-games, etc. It combines good elements from some of my favorite games of the past, such as Shadow of the Colossus and Final Fantasy. Overall I'd say the individual game elements are not new, and I'm not a super-fan of the Hyrule universe, but with elements of many great things combined together into a huge open world, it's probably the most versatile game ever made.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Wow!  I can't say enough positive things about this game.  Amazing graphics, exceptional artwork, & a creative non-linear story line drive Link thru an expansive world full of familiar foes & new challenges.  The knowledge tree / equipment tree is extensive & well thought out. New skills & abilities add a new dimension to the series.  The developers were very careful to keep true to the series, but were also exceptionally creative in building new twists & additions.Just wish I could get my wife off the Switch so I could get some more game time in ;)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
Got this game used for cheap and couldn‚Äôt be happier. I didn‚Äôt come with a case but it‚Äôs fine because of the price I got it for and it was shipped fast.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"The kids loved it, it challenges their problem solving skills, and there isn't anything controversial. The whole family enjoyed it, even the adults.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,9,2021,√âtats-Unis
"The game came packaged very neatly. So far I've spent countless hours playing this game, and to me it seems like there is no end to it.  All of these hours, I had my time spent killing enemies, climbing up mountains, and collecting cool things and I never get tired of it. I believe this is one of the best games on the switch right now if you are looking for a solo player game. This game offers many new features that the older Legend of Zelda games did not have, and by far Breath of the Wild is the best in the Legend of Zelda series.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I purchased the Nintendo Switch in order to play Breath of the Wild (and games like Mario Kart and Super Smash Bros in the future) and honestly I am loving my purchase! I am a big Zelda fan and this game is definitely a lot of fun! The world is huge and full of quests to do! I love the combat system and how the game is more challenging compared to past Zelda games. I definitely recommend picking this game up if you are a big Zelda fan or even a big fan of role playing games. The world is huge, I find myself deviating from the story in order to explore different areas!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I really don't have time to play much during the week, but when I do it's multiplayer games. This is however probably my favorite single player game and story next to Spiderman (PS4). This is a GREAT pastime for 3+ hour flights and 5+ hour trips.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I love, love, LOVE this game.  I'm currently playing through it a second time, it's so much fun.  Link is freaking adorable in this game, and there are so many amazing little DETAILS that you'd never expect, but are always pleasantly surprised to discover.  Like, people calling you out for waking them up, or walking around without clothes, or trying to stable a bear/elk/etc with the horses.  It's a MASSIVE game with lots to do, and the completionist in me was absolutely overwhelmed when I first started it.  Prepare to waste your hours away on this game, and not regret a single second.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,8,2017,√âtats-Unis

If you are like me and never played a zelda game in your life then this game is the best one to play. This game is my first zelda game to play and I absolutely love it! I have played over 50 hours just by doing side quests and messing around in the open world. I am not lying when I say there is plenty of content for the price!! Worth the investment!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I heard a lot of mixed reviews people loving and disliking the game before we purchased. I regret not buying sooner as I didn't want to be disappointed in a Zelda game but there is fun everywhere in this HUGE game. The story line isn't the best but spoiler, the story plays out exactly the way it should base on what happened to the characters... it is a standard Zelda story line exactly what most love. 5 stars as my wife and I have been playing for weeks and not letting up.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2019,√âtats-Unis
I love anything and everything Zelda. I put a few hours in and have not experienced any boss battles yet which everyone complains about. But the puzzles and gameplay really give you a sense of direction and achievement when completing like boss battles in previous Zeldas. Really fun game! I am extremely happy with how vast and beautiful Nintendo has created a giant world while keeping to the same Intellectual Property as the Zelda franchise!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I gave four stars because I find the text hard to read on my switch lite. I really wish we could edit text size. It decreased my enjoyment of the game, I'm sad to say.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I purchased this for my brother for christmas and he absolutely loves it... However I also have the game and can speak from a personal standpoint and well.... I honestly have to say that... I agree. It's not a ""traditional"" Zelda game in certain aspects, however the game does quite a bit to give you the classic Zelda feel. It has TONS of easter eggs, numerous side quests/optional events and countless collectibles. Not to mention having one of the more well written stories for a Zelda game in my opinion. If you have a switch, you NEED to have this game",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"An absolute must-have, all those 10/10 ratings weren't for nothing, this is one of the best video games I have ever played and I recommend it to everyone, not just Zelda fans or gamers (one of my friends was a Zelda hater and now he loves this game). I won't describe it much because there are enough reviews for this game out there in case you're looking for details, I'll just say that if you have a console that can play it, or if you are thinking about getting a console that can play it, just get it, definitely worth it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Beautifully made, challenging, great puzzles and a big open world to explore. It its not a linear path game.  There are a lot of side quest and other stuff to do. Recommend it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Fantastic game. Long time Zelda fans will pick this up easily and new players, this is a great start since you don‚Äôt need to play the other games to follow this one. Exploration is key.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Heading says everything. I've played a lot of games across various platforms, and this one surpassed everything else. Exceptional freedom and mobility, and unlike GTA games and the like, even in the quests and missions game you get totally unrestricted freedom. You can climb anything you like, and paragliding from high distances is a real joy. If you own a Switch, you owe it to yourself to try this out. Give it a chance and it won't disappoint you.By far the best game on the Switch, atleast till now.Don't be fooled by the Zelda in its name, it couldn't be further from the Zelda games's linear gameplay and restricted world.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,8,2019,Inde
"doesnt taste to bad and it has a whole lot of content. with the lackluster launch showing for the switch this really is the only game you ""have to have"". it does have some small frame rate drops but its not all to often and only in docked mode. weirdly enough it doesnt happen in portable mode. visual wise its good in both modes and i have a 55"" tv.  i havent gotten very far but its been really fun and seems like a good amount of stuff to see and do. this game gives me hope that the switch wont suck and could have a good future.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Pros: It looks nice, the open world is great, many quests to keep you entertained, actual outfits that look cool, and different environments.Cons: Story, while it starts off fine, quickly devolves into Link worship and a harem for him. Not really anything new for modern Zelda, just very disappointing. Also, the ost is disappointing. I legitimately can't remember a single song, as it goes for ambient music. Even boss battle music doesn't stick out. Weapon durability is also a pain, as every weapon breaks insanely quickly. Sure, it gives you plenty to work with, as enemies drop weapons even before they die, it's just irritating to deal with.All in all, I enjoyed my experience with the game, but I honestly wouldn't call it one of the best games of all time, nor even the best Zelda game. Take that for what you will.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I have played 175 hours of this game and while I did enjoy it, it just doesn't feel as magical like the rest of the Zelda games. It feels more like Skyrim with a Zelda skin on top of it. The story was not very exciting and the shrines felt pretty repetitive after a while. Some of the areas also have massive frame drops which make those areas unenjoyable to play in. Even with all these annoyances I still go back and play more of this game because there's so much space to explore and find new things.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"The best game I ever had, worth it, if your thinking about buying the switch or the switch lite please think about  this game, it arrived without problems and in the right day",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Got it on sale for 40 dollars and I'm so glad I got it. It has a ton of content for how much it costs and I genuinely believe it's a game that every switch owner should own, whether you're a Zelda fan or not.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Everything about this game is amazing. The graphics, the animations, the strategy you can develop for each weapon vs. every individual monster you encounter...Story line is weak. Not up to Zelda standards.The final Ganon battle at the end is so easy and linear that it makes the whole game feel like an empty joke.If you like gripping story lines and a challenge look elsewhere, but if you want to be amazed at every single detail in a fantasy GTA esque game then this game will keep you entertained for a long time.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Wow fantastic game. So much fun and adventure.  I bought this on the  Wii U and Switch.  I have to say the game is identical.  There is no need to own it twice, unless you are like me and you have to compete with your kids for time on one of your Nintendo consoles.Since I now own both a  Wii U and a switch the kids now own the Wii U copy and I own the Switch version!!!!

"This game is amazing! The package arrived fast and was brand new in great condition. The game itself took the Legend of Zelda Games to a different level! I‚Äôm in love with it. I love the open world aspect of it, you can even face Ganon from the start (which of course I wouldn‚Äôt recommend) but they left this game up to you. There is no chronological order per say. All I can say is that the Legend of Zelda games have yet to disappoint and this by far is amazing. Highly recommend!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,9,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I love zelda games, to include Zelda 2, but was very concerned about the step away from the tried and true format that this game was taking for the series. Turns out, I had no reason to worry because this game is AMAZING. So much to do and see and so many different ways to accomplish things. Even though it shares similarities to past entries and even games like Skyrim and Assassin's Creed, it's not even fair to try and compare this game to any other because it does everything so well that it stands in a league of its own. Totally worth buying a new console for.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I got a Switch for my wife as a lucky accident at the end of April. She'd been searching for it for weeks on an almost daily basis, calling and visiting local stores. We got Zelda with it, because at the time of writing, there wasn't anything else (we actually got it the day after Mario Kart came out and quickly ordered that too). I haven't been allowed to play Zelda because my wife likes it so much, she's monopolizing the system.And that's OK. I did get it for her. Didn't you read the first line of the review?",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
Came in plastic it did have the lines on the metal that everyone else is experiencing. The lines are all precise though so I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs from the manufacturer. Game works.

I had recently picked up a Switch and this was easily my first purchase as I've been paying Zelda games since the first one for the NES. I know it's pointless and my review is not going to charge anyone's opinion at all as this game been out long enough and has had so much praise.I've put nearly 40 hours into this game and I just do not understand what all the hype is about. Nothing about this game at all feels or plays like a Zelda game of the past. That's fine and all but I feel so removed that I completely lose all interest in everything in this game as there is little to no memorable characters or moments in the game. I feel like I have been wasting my time. I have limited time as it is to play games so when a game asks me to commit so much time get any value from it I feel like I've been had and wasted my money. It's far from a bad game I just felt like this game wasted my time and I get little to nothing in return for it.,3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"My two boys, aged eight and nine, have been playing this game for a while and are about to complete it. I cannot speak highly enough about how much fun it is to watch them explore the world, engage in combat, and solve the puzzles. The world is beautiful, engaging, and it is difficult to return to the everyday world. I sit down to watch and I am surprised when I realize that an hour has passed.I have played the game a bit myself and greatly enjoyed it, but I don't have enough free time to dedicate to actually completing it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I have had SO much fun playing this game it seriously sucks you in. I love the break from a traditional, guided storyline. After playing through the beginning, I spent the next two days sneaking, using food/potions, and sometimes just plain running away in order to totally unlock the map. And this game doesn't care. No insurmountable blocks that require an item. There's definitely items that make it easier, no question, but if your heart is set on finding all the shiekah towers first thing, there's really nothing stopping you. Stock up on stamina food, and maybe the player's guide and have at. Definitely buy the guide!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

I love the open world feel, the ability to do different quests, and use different weapons and things. It's almost like a Zelda version of The Elder Scrolls. I've spent quite a few hours in this game already, and barely even scraped the surface of what the game has to offer. If you're looking for a game to keep you occupied for hours and you can only choose one game to get, this is definitely the one.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,6,2018,√âtats-Unis

When I dumped him he quickly went through the apartment to sell any valuables that he had gifted to me, including this game!! I was so annoyed.

Si eres fan de los juegos lineales, creo que no te lo recomendar√≠a, a mi me pareci√≥ confuso al principio porque no sab√≠a que hacer o a donde ir, el truco es explorar y esperar a que suceda algo. Los enemigos, obst√°culos y el ""medio ambiente"" del universo de BOTW te dir√°n donde estas listo a ir y a donde no. Muy entretenido, tanto para jugarlo con el dock como en el modo portabilidad.

"Rarely is a game so good that I feel I didn't pay enough.  It's a good feeling when you play something you know was caressed for a long time.  Nintendo's didn't just put this out there, their development team clearly spent countless hours putting this masterpiece together. The Wild really comes to life here.  Prepare to be immersed into this fantasy world.  Warning -- you're going to spend a lot of time & you're not going to want to put it down.  Almost shamefully, I took the day off work & I'm about 8 hours in, day one... and counting.  Enjoy!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"By far THE best Zelda game in the franchise. It was love at first sight. The more I played, the more immersed I got. There are a few things missing that were staples in previous games, but the more I thought about it and played, the more I tossed the previous thoughts to the back of my mind. There are new and exciting things around every corner, and it is visually stunning. Considering the system it is played on and its capabilities, the game more than surpasses my expectation. Ten years from now, this may go down as the most memorable game in the Zelda universe.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Virtually unlimited entertainment value with this game. The world is massive and has beautiful visuals. Hyrule is a charming land with plenty of mysteries to be explored. The soundtrack is very calming. Sometimes I enjoy wandering in the virtual world just to unwind. There are lots of sidequests to keep you busy.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I wish I had played this sooner.  Lots of fun, challenging, but not overly difficult.  Great story that seems to be leading somewhere beyond just this game.  Every bit worth the praise that it has received.If there's one thing, just go on ahead and give Link real dialogue in the next game.  Might as well at this point.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I would give this game a 9 out of 10 score. Great new gameplay and music! Jumping on the hype of game of the year, the story was great but needed more development (4 divine champs, shortest story on a Zelda game) hence the worst ending in a Zelda game (expected more) The Lynels are harder to kill than Ganon, lol! The overall experience is awesome and you should not miss this game despite everything I said before. You will spend most of the time exploring instead wich will always get you to see something new!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I bought a Nintendo Switch just for this. I felt like I wasted my money. Ocarina of Time was my favorate This game sucked.  EDIT Mar 2019: I‚Äôm reviewing old reviews, I wasn‚Äôt very discriptive for a game review, I‚Äôll add more..So the game itself looks pretty good, but I just felt disconnected from the story. I was in 8th grade when Ocarina of Time cameout. That game blew me away, and I was heavily invested. I‚Äôve never felt so connected or enjoyed a game where it felt like a true adventure. I was hoping to get that same feeling almost 20 years later.That didn‚Äôt happen. Instead, I was playing a game that felt complete different from the old Zelda games I remembered. I felt so disconnected from it. People rave about this game, but to me, it was an empty world. the idea that you‚Äôre weapons broke was annoying. I don‚Äôt understand why they strayed away from the basic concepts of Zelda. I eventually find the Master Sword trough an annoying side quest. That breaks too, but you‚Äôre able to reuse it after a short time. Double-U Tee Eff.To me, this game was a horrible reach into some world that tried to match current adventure games. The open world concept with the ability to do all kinds of new things. For me, classic games are best sticking to basics. The risk that was taken to make it different was a stupid idea.I can‚Äôt tell you how many times I sat there wondering an empty land, occasionally finding bad guys, looking for the puzzle temples to get skill points to upgrade Link. I just wanted to stop plying, but felt compelled to beat it first. After I beat it, I never touched it again.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Si bien me gustan los videojuegos, he de decir que tengo poco tiempo para jugar y por otra parte es la primera consola de Nintendo desde mi infancia con el NES, nunca jugu√© un zelda este fue el primero y la verdad me encanto mucho, no lo he terminado y no se si lo llegue a hacer (por falta de tiempo) sin embargo en alguna occasion pase toda la tarde jugandolo y me recordo cuando era peque√±o y pasaba horas y horas jugando, este juego pese a ser de nintendo no lo considero para ni√±os, no por que no sea apto pero si es mas complejo a comparaci√≥n de otros como mario, mis hijos son peque√±os y no les llama tanto la atenci√≥n como mario a si que supongo que es un juego mas recomendado para mayores de 11",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,6,2018,Mexique
Definitely enjoyed BOTW but not as much as I thought I would.  It's a great game and everything it did it did well. But I don't think it did anything new or unique other open world games have already done.  If you are getting this for the combat you will most likely be disappointed also.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

Si te gustan los juegos de aventura es una compra obligada. Incluso es un buen juego para alguien no tan grande, mi sobrino de 7 a√±os lo ha jugado y amado desde hace m√°s de un a√±o.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,11,2020,Mexique

"I have a bad habit of starting and not finishing games, but this one was almost impossible to put down. Other than skyward sword (which I started but didn't play very long) this was my first Zelda game. The only reason I actually finished the main quest on this instead of exploring every single inch of the map is because it has made me excited to try other titles in the Zelda franchise. I'll be saving the additional exploring for another playthrough in Master Mode (available through DLC).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Fun game with a massive open world. Seemingly infinite possibilities for exploration, although the weapons system is not the best.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Game arrived on time and new in case. The game itself is fairly bland especially if youre familiar with the rpg genre. The tedious cooking and weapon management is...immersion killing. This game is essentially a cooking game with fairly entertaining exploration to gather ingredients.  Fighting is rather pointless as the enemies dont drop anything worth your time and the chests are super bland most of the time. Puzzles are ok, but nothing special. The story is abysmal the npcs make extremely goofy emotive sounds.  Back to the weapons...holy hell, they break so fast...3 to 4 swings. And the cooking...is exceptionally tedious. To cook a dish you must go into your inventory every time to combine individual ingredients. For how important and focused this game is on cooking, youd think theyd allow easier cooking of dishes youve discovered.  All said and done, its a 5/10 from me.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
I'm not a fan of Zelda games. I liked Wind Waker and that is about it. I far prefer the Final Fantasy games.  I only bought this for my wife to play with the console undocked while I play Xbox one on the tv. I decided to try it after watching her.....this game is FANTASTIC. You can easily spend hours roaming and discovering on top of a fun storyline. There is sooooo much to explore and find. The only reason I stop playing each day is because I have to and not because I want to. This is one of my new favorite games.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Fantastic game. Really helped to breathe new life into the Legend of Zelda series. Great open world, tricky shrines, fun side quests, and difficult bosses. Wasn't so hard I wanted to quit in a rage, but wasn't so easy I was bored, either.While the story is short and not as complicated as, let's say Twilight Princess, it is compelling and satisfying.If you can move past he fact this isn't a more traditional Zelda game, you'll enjoy it. It may lack familiar elements, but at the end of the day it is just as much of a Zelda game as the rest.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I haven't had a Nintendo system since the 64, so I think the last Zelda game I played was on the original 8 bit system and this Zelda is amazingly fun! I wish instead of having the dialogue boxes, it would have more actual speaking of the characters you will encounter. I imagine this is due to the size of the game. The worlds are large and it looks great on my TV as well as on the embedded screen.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,6,2019,√âtats-Unis
This was the first Zelda game i played. I am 22 and played games all my life since childhood. According to my switch it says i have spent a total of +150 hours. Thats a lot of gameplay for one game. I enjoyed this game and believe its worth the price to play.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Wow, highly recommended. I have never really liked Zelda, but this game changes it all up. It is very fun to play and is truly an open world game. You can go anywhere you want whenever you want. You can defeat Ganon right from the start if you want to. There is nothing keeping you from getting to places you shouldn't be. If you want to go to the hardest dungeon first then you can do that. It is amazing. 10/10. Also it has so much play ability after you beat Ganon. I've beat him twice and I still want to play.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"bought it for my sister for Xmas, she had already been gifted it the night prior so I took this copy and bought her animal crossing instead. playing through the opening hours and I'm already bored and irritated with the weapon system in the game. not really a Zelda fan though, and to its credit, the game is very pretty and has a vast open-world and would definitely merit the hype to a person who is a fan of the series, but I just don't care enough about Zelda to slog through all of it.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I can't say anything about this game that hasn't been said.But I'll say this:I don't have a ton of time for videogames, so when I play I want to be transported to a world that blows my socks off every time. This game is the perfect solution for me. I can hop in, wander aimlessly, or chip away at the main quest, and either way I enjoy every moment. As a long-time fan of both Zelda games and more recently Dark Souls, this is the perfect combination of difficulty with adventure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I've played a lot of games, including a lot of Zelda games, and this may be my favorite game of all time.

Buy it now, thank me later!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2020,√âtats-Unis

The gameplay is masterfully crafted and never seems to get old. The game's world is so huge, expansive, and fun to explore. The storyline and soundtrack are just perfect. And the graphics are just amazing. I can't help but stop and stare at the amazing views in this game. This is an amazing work of art that everyone with a Switch should own.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,6,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Wow. Just...wow. I really didn't know if I was going to like this much, since the older Zelda games were my bread and butter as a kid.Boy, was I wrong. I've sunk about 60 hours into this game and I've only beaten one of the four pre-Gannon bosses so far. I'm impressed by literally every part of this game, from graphics to combat. I'm especially a fan of mountain climbing! Plus, being able to shoot skeleton heads off is loads of fun. Absolutely a 10/10 game that will keep me busy for weeks on and off.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is definitely my favorite Zelda game to date. It's got beautiful graphics and excellent gameplay. This will be a game that I return to again and again after I've finished it. There is so much area to explore, and a lot of extras hidden throughout the game.I bought this to play on my Switch, and I feel like if you really want to put your new handheld device to the test, this is the game to do it with. Zelda: Breath of the Wild exceeds all my expectations. This game also looks superb when you've docked your Switch and are playing on the big screen.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

This game is fun, challenging, intimidating and intriguing.Ignore anyone that hates this game. They either haven't played the game or gave a bad review to be ""cool"" for giving this highly acclaimed game a bad score.It's not a perfect game, but it's close.Take it from someone new to this franchise, you WILL NOT go wrong with this game and worth every penny.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I got an empty envelope in my mailbox. Used the app to contact customer service, they will be re-crediting my account.

I highly recommend!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Nintendo clearly lavished a great deal of time and thought in the making of this game.It is very hard to stop playing because you always want to see what's just over that hill.The game is hard,but not too hard,just so that it's satisfying to solve whatever it is you are trying to accomplish whether it be a quest or shrine,or just how to beat those monsters.I do find the pro controller best suited for playing this game though.If you decide to play Breath of the Wild,I hope you enjoy it as much as I am!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,7,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm a Nintendo fan also a Zelda fan. I played all Zelda game since GBA time. Well I have to say breath of the wild is the most impressing Zelda game, it's a combination of transitional link adventure plus monster hunter plus harvest moon etc. I got bomb man, kof98 and other games with my switch console, I played them for couples of days until breath of the wild came‚Ä¶since then I can't stop playing BOW any more‚Ä¶the map is huge (most huge ever?), you have full freedom how preceed the game, how battle monsters. It's definitely a game deserve 200+ hours.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Thank the gods of nintendo for this game, I loved it. It has a fair difficult level and feels like a single player mmo in a way but without the he boredom of a free mmo you'd find online. It doesn't feel very much like your classic zelda except for the shrine sections, however you can get a bit bored of how every puzzle shrine looks about the same after a while. The puzzles however are very enjoyable. Combat Is harder now, but feels much more satisfying or rewarding once you beat your foes.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
Has kept me on my feet the whole time I've been play. Always something to do and discover,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Nintendo did something different and it was good. I'm late to the party but it was fun. Lacked a bit of depth due to the nature of the world, combat was fluid and easy to learn. Lots of outfits and sets to find. Some cool tricks and glitches with the combat.Zelda was annoyingly whiney, though.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2020,√âtats-Unis

"Muy entretenido, sobre todo para los que les gusta explorar y pasearse. Muchas referencias a practicamente todos los otros titulos de la franquicia, lo cual le da un extra para los fans que han jugado TLoZ a lo largo de los a√±os.Si tienen contemplados los DLC recomendaria tenerlos desde que comienzan a jugar, ya que terminando la parte tipo ""prologo"" ya es posible encontrarse con el contenido extra que ofrecen los DLC.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2020,Mexique
"You don‚Äôt need me to tell you about this game. If you own a switch, and haven‚Äôt played it, get it, like now.

Single player, hundreds of hours of exploring and rarely a dull moment.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
This game was the motivating reason for getting a Nintendo Switch. $60 for this fun filled adventure game plus $300 for the Switch was well worth it. The game is not perfect but oh man this game is simply amazing!

Only recommend to people who love adventure games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I know this game is amazing even though I only played a couple hours. That's because while looking for the Switch, I watched all the gameplay for this game and then when I got it, played a couple hours then I stopped since I knew everything that would happen later it kinda ruined it for me. If I could I wouldn't have watched all those gameplay videos, because this truly is one of the best games that I still think about it to this day, that it haunts me I didn't play it myself.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"While not a perfect title by any means, Nintendo proves they can do an amazing job with any genre by making travel in an open world game actually enjoyable.

"Have not stopped playing it since the first day it was out. Haven't been so obsessed about a game since the very first Halo many years ago on the original XBox. The gameplay and wonderment never ceaeses to amaze me. Playing on a big 1080p HDTV screen is immersive and will make you wonder how you are able to spend hours and hours just playing the game. Portable mode on the Switch is pretty awesome too. For old and new Zelda fans alike, this is the game that will sell millions of Nintendo Switch. A must play for video game fans!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I am literally in love with this game. Didn't expect to be, as this is my first Zelda game, but now I'm hooked.

"I have played all The Legend of Zelda series games, and the BOTW was a masterpiece. The overall game has tasks and goals you must achieve to proceed. For example, finding Kurok seeds so you can expand your weapon, shield, bows and arrow arsenal. There are 900 Kurok seeds in the the game. I have spent over 400 hours finding every nook and cranny in this game finding secrets and solving side missions in BOTW.

This game didn't disappoint me.  The money spent on buying a Switch was money well spent.  It is a truly a masterpiece as far as game design goes.  Sure the graphics aren't as detailed or impressive as in games designed for PS4 or XBox.

"I've been a fan of the Legend of Zelda series since the beginning.  Until this game, Ocarina of Time was the game that had lasted as my favorite.  I thought it would hold that position forever, but Breath of the Wild surpassed all of my expectations.  When I finished the game, I then played it through again.  There are other games I've gone back to over the years to replay again, but I can't think of any other where I wanted to do that immediately after finishing the game the first time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Llevo pocos d√≠as jugando, pero los suficientes para decir que es sin duda de los mejores de la saga. El sistema de juego cambi√≥ un poco, y en lo personal me cost√≥ un poco adaptarme, pero no para mal sino para bien. La integraci√≥n de las misiones secundarias y la manera de tener que conseguir las armas, comida, materiales y rupias para conseguir/mejorar lo que tienes hace que el juego no sea lineal y te enfoques solamente en la historia principal. Recomendad√≠simo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,6,2020,Mexique
"I got this for my nephew, he loves it and I love it whenever he is not playing I am playing it is a very entertaining game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
Great game for young and old alike to explore and improve.  It's easy to figure out and master over time with many online guides and hints to help when you get frustrated or stuck. Expansion pack adds a lot more to the game as well.  I'm looking forward to the sequel hopefully coming in 2020.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Honestamente he jugado varios juego como por ejemplo the witcher 3, pero este juego es bastante complicado ya que no te dice d√≥nde ir y tampoco tiene alg√∫n tutorial de c√≥mo eliminar a tus oponentes, te matan mucho y puede ser un dolor de cabeza. Me sorprende que tenga 5 estrellas siendo un juego un poco complicado y sin un rumbo de c√≥mo terminar el juego. Lo que tengo que aceptar es lo hermoso que se ve, pero vuelvo y repito, ES COMPLICADO Y FRUSTRANTE.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,1,2021,√âtats-Unis

What makes it fun, the open world,  super powers, changing day night,  the climbing,  the crafting,  the characters,  the gliding,  the teleporting, the boarding,  wolf link,  the many battles with many foes.  It's just a blast to play,  it's like going on a great hike in the comfort of your lving room and when you get tired, just take a nap lol.  It's so awesome!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is one of my favorite video games ever. I originally bought it for the Wii U, but when I got the switch I wanted to try it on that too. I actually prefer playing it on the Wii U just because of the design of the controllers. After playing only a short while on the switch, my right thumb hurts because of the location of the joystick on the right hand controller.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I got this after getting my Switch as I'm a huge Zelda fan, and have been playing them since A Link to the Past on SNES. It has a small learning curve, but once you're past that it's really fun to just mindlessly wander the overworld and explore new regions. Almost done with it now though, and hope that BoTW 2 will be just as good if not better!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,9,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I have played a lot of video games, and a lot of Zelda games, and this one may be the most fun. It isn't perfect, but it has provided dozens and dozens of hours of enjoyment to my family. It is beautiful, exciting, and massive.If you want to explore, seek treasure, and kill monsters, you could do so for 200 hours without getting close to the end of the game's content. If you want to power through the storyline as fast as possible, you could probably reasonably do so in 10 hours or so.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

Could improve in a few things as everything, but the games gives so much to the user.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent game. Takes all of the things I love about the original Zelda games and brings it to the open world RPG genre. The last Zelda game I played was the first few hours of Twilight Princess, and I just couldn‚Äôt get into it. This has me hooked.People will always find things they don‚Äôt like about games - the weapons break, it rains too much, etc. But take a second to realize it for what it is, and you have to admit - It‚Äôs a masterpiece.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,2,2018,√âtats-Unis

And he pulled all nighters playing it. He was a huge fan of the old school Zelda so what better gift to give than this one? The graphics are really good and there are tons of stuff you have to do so it‚Äôs not some easy win game. You‚Äôre out collecting apples and potatoes and cooking your own meals and stuff. Very small details you have to do in order to survive the nights and the winters. He loves it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I love this game. It is so immersive that I just want to play it every day, and I don't want it to end. I'm taking my time finishing the game because there are so many places to go and so many ways to get there. I have two friends who are also playing the game, and we love comparing what order we're doing things in, because we are each taking our own paths through the game and having completely different experiences because of it. The graphics are great, and the game runs well on the Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
I really love my teenage daughter. Like enough love to strangle her. BUT OMG I need some alone time. Thanks to Link my sanity is slowly coming back to me. She has spent a couple of hours each day on her quest to find hearts and swords and who knows what else. It is money well spent. She's happy and I'm happy just watching her play. I still have my original gold Legend of Zelda and my Nintendo console. The graphics are a bit better now I have to admit but the adventure is still there. Love it!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I was a skeptic before I bought this. I haven't played a Zelda game before and thought it was going to be cheesy. This game is incredible! It blows me away everytime I play it. If you love exploring and adventure, this is the game for you. There's so much to see, so many things to do. Even when you think you've seen it all, they introduce some new gameplay and it blows me away!I'm a Zelda convert now! I'll start making Ganon references too.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I couldn't put this game down until I had completed nearly everything there was to do in it. The entire game is amusing, rewarding, challenging (less challenging towards the end), wonderful, and more. This is a must have for anyone who owns a switch and a reason to own a switch for those who don't. Easily the best game I have played in a while. For anyone who might think I should give that honor to Horizon which I've also played recently I would simply ask, ""Couldn't you actually put Horizon down though?""",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Crying while playing.As a Chinese player, it's so amazing to see the high-level, official Chinese translation. Some proverbs shows Nintendo's attitude of localization.I find the curious that I lost for a long time inside this game. I couldn't help to see what will happen if I strike fire sword on some apple, what will I get if I combine these stuff.Couldn't help thinking Satoru Iwata's quote, ""But in my heart, I am a gamer"". This is the best game I ever met.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This is by far the best open world game I‚Äôve ever played and I‚Äôve played a lot ‚Äì Skyrim, Dragon Age, all the Baldur‚Äôs Gate series and I‚Äôve never had so much fun looking for seeds, fighting bosses, exploring shrines, fighting mini bosses and such. Nintendo has been magically created an open world game with a sense of order where you don‚Äôt get bored roaming around and fighting monsters. And there‚Äôs a bit of nostalgia too, if you ever played the Ocarina of Time, there‚Äôs some memorable moments in that game transferred subtly to Breath of the Wild.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

I‚Äôve only played the original Zelda from the NES days. Didn‚Äôt see the appeal in the subsequent Zelda titles. I‚Äôm hooked on this one! It takes a lot of patience to explore. There‚Äôs so much to it. I like that I can save almost any time. The puzzles in the shrines are challenging. The kids do not see the appeal in this game and give me the stink eye when I‚Äôm hogging the Switch with Zelda.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,1,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I have been a huge fan of Zelda for many years.  I started playing it as a child on the regular Nintendo.  This version of Zelda is truly a Masterpiece.  At first I was a bit thrown off by the open world concept and the fact that weapons deteriorate.  However, I have grown to really enjoy these aspects.  This game is seemingly endless with an extremely fun main story and many side quests to keep you entertained.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Phenomenal Game.  I see why it won game of the year a couple years ago.  By this time, this have needs no review as I'm sure any gamer knows how massively successful it has been, but right now is a great time to buy this have since the sequel will be out very soon...well soonish.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2020,√âtats-Unis

"What can I possibly write that hasn't been said ten times over by everyone else and every other publication out there?This is a fantastic game and possibly the best game I have played in the last ten years. That said, it is very easy to get burn out on this game, with all of it's shrines and seeds to find. The end of the game - and I mean the last couple hours - kind of became a grind after completing most of the ""optional"" side quests/shrines/etc.Get it; you won't regret it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I took my time in purchasing a switch. I've always been an xbox gamer, and while I felt nostalgia for nintendo, the Wii U and handhelds never grabbed my interest, until Breath of the Wild. I mean this without any exaggeration, that the 300 dollars I payed for the switch, and the 60 dollars I payed for BOTW were both worth it solely for this game. It is an incredible romp, with a dynamic world, changing characters, and stakes that feel real. I never want to put it down.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,11,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is hands down the best game I have ever played, and I have been playing games for a long time as well and many different games.But as of late I haven't been playing long games, just little things I can go in and out of.

I never wrote a review for this game until now and I am sure that there is hardly anyone that hasn't heard of this game and is still undecided, but I felt after the hundreds of hours of joy I have found in this game deserved a proper review.

There's progression systems i.e. lots of gear/weapons to upgrade.Only critique I have is, rarely the frame rate will drop a decent amount for a couple seconds when the game is, what I'm assuming is loading/rendering the areas in the distance. It doesn't happen very often and is a negligible con.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"One of the best games of 2017. I have this on both the WiiU and the Switch, and the differences are staggering. The WiiU version of the game has a lot of framerate issues, is a nightmare to load up, and occasionally crashes if there are too many bomb explosions on the screen. The Switch version has very few loading issues or any problems with dropping frames. It can handle all the random explosions that happen along the adventuring path. A great game for kids and kids at heart alike.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I have never been a Zelda fan. I bought this game out of interest sparked by the open world concept. I really had no idea what I was getting myself into, and I literally have no regrets. I have logged in over a hundred hours on this game, and it has yet to get boring. I have never owned a game like this. If you have not played Breath of the Wild, I feel sorry for you.

I wish gear didn't need to be replaced so quickly, but I have spent hours and hours and hours playing and I haven't gotten tired of it yet.

The story is a bit too simplistic and I hate all the grunts and moans the characters do when they speak but other than that the game is perfect.  I am only about 35 hours into it and I am just exploring everything.  Reminds me of the original NES game where you would get dumped in the world and you would just wander around trying to explore everything sometimes wandering into a wrong place only to get destroyed by some high-level enemy.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

I absolutely loved it! I'm obsessed with this game and have been playing it non stop! It came super early and I enjoy it!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
Very good good weapons and Meele attacks and combos very free range and awesome story line.would highly recommend if you have that thrill seeking adventure crave.The only problem is moving the camera a lot on a tv But on a portable console like switch really good and awsome side missions.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
Its a great game but I ended up skipping all monster battles that I encounter since there was no benefit at all for killing them. Even the treasures that were found around the world were worthless. Shrines are the best thing in the game. I wish that voice acting was all over the game since it was great but it was only limited to cutscenes.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,9,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I loved this game! Fully open world, and places to see, people to meet, and monsters to fight! I absolutely adored the story-line and the inclusion of memories. I wish I could forget the game and play it all over again. For now, I will wait for BOTW 2",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"All of my kids: two pre-teens, one 20-something, and a 30-something all enjoy this game. I even enjoy watching it a bit at times. Not offensive, good animations, challenging puzzles to solve, and a huge game overall. Good family-friendly choice with lots of play time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
Es un juego muy hermoso. Lo √∫nico que no me gusto es tener que conseguir espada y escudo cada 5 segundos,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,10,2021,Mexique
"O Jogo √© perfeito e a entrega foi r√°pida, chegando na primeira semana que comprei.Unico adendo √© que levei um baque, eu lembro que quando comprava jogo para DS vinha monte de livrinho ilustrado falando do jogo personagem. E agr os jogos s√£o mo caro e n√£o vem nada. Poh nintendo.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2021,Br√©sil
"This game has to be one of my favorites, its fun and easy to play and it has a neat story.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Es el mejor juego de la consola con gran diferencia, te embarcas en una aventura alrededor de todo hyrule, si es t√∫ primera experiencia en un zelda no hay problema ya que el juego muestra los controles constantemente, tiene cientos de secretos, cientos de horas de juego y una historia apasionante y conmovedora. Mi juego favorito a partir de ahora, no veia una joya tan impresionante desde la epoca de la Wii",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,7,2020,Mexique
"Yes, another 5 star review for Breath of the Wild. It is an amazing environment to play in. Many many hours of entertainment.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
Such a drastic change to the average Zelda game. Instead of playing through dungeons to get an item that can access the next dungeon you have everything at your disposal from the beginning and are free to go pretty much anywhere you like. I've spent over 120 hours enjoying this game!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Such an amazing game. This one is up there as my fav of all time. So much to do, and exploring is so much fun. It def gets challenging (imo) but not too tough. I‚Äôd recommend this game to anyone, you just can‚Äôt go wrong no matter what genre your into.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
It came fast and safe and also it‚Äôs a great game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"My husband (34) and my son (6) both really enjoy this game. It took about 2 months for my husband to complete the game (playing the game a few night a week after the kids go to bed). My son is still working on it. Even though he cannot read, that has not stopped him from fully understanding what is going on in the game. He loves it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,3,2019,√âtats-Unis
This is an amazing game! Should be pretty obvious with all the rewards its won.Open world and the story progresses exactly the way you want it to. No defined path to follow. You get a starting area to learn the ropes and right after you can go and fight the final boss if you wanted to.I love the openess of the game and it really makes you feel like this is YOUR adventure,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
Not a traditional Zelda game but very fun and the world is huge and full of surprises. I logged days just doing the campaign and a few side quests while exploring. The DLC adds even more to it along with more outfits and places to explore and character development. Excited for the sequel,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Si estas aqui es porque conoces y sabes de la importancia de esta serie de videojuegos en el mundo gamer. La leyenda de Zelda tiene brillo propio y esta nueva version es un nuevo inicio para las aventuras de Link, Ganon y Zelda.Hablando del producto lo que mas me impresiona es el tama√±o tan reducido del cartucho donde viene alojado el juego, es mucho mas peque√±o que cualquier cartucho del 3ds asemejandose mas a una tarjeta SD. Si vez las fotos que he tomado te daras una idea del tama√±o de las tarjetas del switch.Del juego aun no puedo hablar mucho ya que apenas lo he recibido el dia de hoy pero leyendo las rese√±as y el score que tiene en metacritic, estamos quizas con el mejor Zelda de toda la historia. Por mi parte es una compra por demas recomendada.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Mexique
"Amazing Zelda game, all there is to it. A must play.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
I love the game just what i exspected and came really fast.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"El producto lleg√≥ sellado y nuevo. El juego es de lo mejor de Zelda (tan bueno como Ocarina of Time) ya lo hab√≠a jugado, lo compre para regalo a mi sobrino.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,8,2021,Mexique
fast shipments! Card is brand new! perfect! Will come again,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Como fan de la saga, te puedo decir que es el ""Legend of Zelda"" menos ""Legend of Zelda"" que he jugado pero no me mal entiendas, solo estoy estableciendo una base aqui.Es la primera vez que vemos un Zelda en un modo ""open world"" por lo que no dudes que pasar√°s horas y horas explorando, cazando, cocinando, recolectando, todo esto sin haber realmente haber avanzado nada de la l√≠nea de historia, por lo que hace de BoW un juego con muchas m√°s opciones y posibilidad de juego sin seguir la l√≠nea tradicional de quests-rewards de un RPG tradicional. Es un juego muy entretenido que brinda las caracter√≠sticas esenciales requeridas para un juego LoZ pero lo suficiente mente libre como para no sentirse como tal. No se si sea el mejor juego de los √∫ltimos tiempos pero seguramente se encuentra en el top 5.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,4,2017,Mexique
"I'm 33 years old. I've played Zelda since I was 3 years old. I can confidently say: THIS IS THE GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!I won't spoil anything. You owe it to yourself and the child inside of you to play this game. You will discover why when you do. I have a family of 4. My two sons love video games. They watched in awe as I opened our Switch and then played Zelda. The nostalgia, the quality of the game and controller, what a time to be ALIVE!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
if your a Zelda fan this is the game for you. I play this game everyday and never get bored always something new to do in this huge open world game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
I've read the reviews online in advance. I bought the game and I've just finished the plateau training level. My thoughts? Simply amazing! I took a chance on this game as I was not sure I would take to it. But this game makes me want to explore more. Makes me want to find more. I have no regrets! I am a convert to video gaming with this one title.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,12,2019,Inde
One if not the best game ive ever played. Its been years since ive been hooked on a game like this. Beautiful absolutely beautiful. If youre debating on getting this. Get it. Do it now,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
"BoTW is great! Tons of freedom in an open world setting, with a non-linear approach to most aspects of the traditional Zelda formula. Tackle dungeons and obtain weapons, items, and armor in any order you want. Tons of movement and exploration options. Must buy if you own a Switch",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
I bought it used but in good condition. I'm so happy I got this at a discount rather than paying full price on the nintendo eshop. The case came a little scratched up but whoever had this before took care of it overall.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"To me this is honestly the best Zelda game of the series it maybe because of the Nintendo Switch itself, but the graphics, the gameplay, the environment, its a really Great Game. Get it if you haven't done so.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,5,2020,√âtats-Unis
"For once, Metacritic did not lie.Hey, listen: I'm not going to write a whole lot because if dozens of ""professional"" reviewers haven't swayed you, then some random internet idiot surely won't.  LoZ: BotW is just...beautiful, fun and a fantastic launch title.  If the Switch succeeds, it will be almost entirely due to the head start this game gives it in building a user base.  This is one of the best games of the year in what is shaping up to be a killer year for gaming!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
This was one of the first games I bought for my Switch and I love it! Lots of side quests and an excellent story line. The artwork is amazing as well.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Wow. It‚Äôs very hard to summarize this game. Open world Zelda, with a big variety of challenges for every age. Only a few dungeons but a lot of puzzle solving in each. This is the best game since Ocarina of Time (N64) and a must for everyone with a switch. Only downside is that they charge another $20 for the DLCs.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This game rocks my world. When Nintendo says they're going to make ""an open world game"" they aren't messing around. For a completionist like myself, there is an endless amount of things to do. I'm still floored by how big the world is. I'm really glad there are horses in the game, because I do a LOT of running. I think maybe 40% of my gameplay is, in fact, running. :PMy only remaining wish is that I could play this in VR T_T",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Wonderful game in my opinion it deserves all the praise it's been getting on the internet its so good i have the wii u version but also the nintendo switch version as well. The switch version is the definitive version sporting a higher resolution, better sound quality and now you can truly take it on the go. I won't say everybody will enjoy it but i highly recommend buying it or renting it it's definitely worth testing out.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This is my favorite game of all time. It gives you the opportunity to travel in an open world concept with your favorite character and determine your own destiny. It is challenging and provides opportunities to solve puzzles, use skill in fighting, and just go on an adventure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
Nintendo does it again with their flagship IP.  The game is a fresh take on the Zelda series with the new open world format.  The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and the game play is as good as it gets.  The fact that I can play it wherever I want (which I do) is an incredible bonus.  One of the best games in the history of video games that should be a required purchase for any gamer.  Seriously.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
Best game I have played in a long time. I don't play games often so I like something I can pick up quickly and not feel like it's work to figure out how to play. Load times are short for such a big open world so it's easy to come back to for a quick session.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I have played this games three times over and have logged over 200 hours on it and there is still more to do. I love this game so much, each time you play it‚Äôs a totally different experience. I definitely recommend this amazing game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Wish I could give 6 stars. Reminds me of an improved version of skyrim. Also had the best gaming experience of my life on it today. I was adventuring around to find a tower when I stubbbled upon a sleeping giant. An elk ran around from behind him and while it was barreling passed me I jumped up onto it and calmed it down, I then took out that giant Princess Mononoke style. Excuse the quality of the picture I forgot about the switch capture button.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Not the Zelda you are used to. Excellent RPG. Well thought out. Impressive thought process in creating this. Visually dazzling. Lighting, shading, detail, abilities, tools.... feels unique. Gameplay is epic.I only wanted to play through once though. When it was done, there was no feeling for me to replay. Maybe if i could continue after beating the game and continue to get stronger for the sake of it.I still highly recommend.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,6,2018,√âtats-Unis
"A monumental achievement by Nintendo. Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild will likely go down as one of the best games of all time - a new status quo for excellence. It is a joy to explore Hyrule. Even after 80+ hours, it's a world I haven't gotten bored of, and am constantly itching for more time for further exploration.If you own a Nintendo Switch, getting this is a no-brainer. If you're a fan of videogames, this is a game you owe it to yourself to check out.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
The videos made the graphics look better but it is awesome sends me back to the 90s,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this game. There are so many ways to play.  You can kill opponents using the environment (in one case I rolled a boulder down on them) or by force (sword or bow and arrow). And of course there‚Äôs the crafting, gathering, and exploring.  I‚Äôve played about 10 hours so far and I know I‚Äôve just scratched the surface.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I have played every game ever conceived and this game is a 10 out of 10. This game is terrific. Just a rare gem like the elder scrolls, portals, half-lifes, mysts, etc. Ignore any negative reviews, do yourself a favor and buy this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
Amazing game and beautiful can't  wait for BOTW 2.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
Purchased for my grandson and he is still enjoying it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
One of my favorite games. Definitely a must buy for the Nintendo Switch!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I can't tell how many hours I been playing this week, it's an amazing game. I'm happy with this purchase.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Late review, but as anyone who has already played and reviewed the game has said, it is simply...breath-taking. Great visuals, Addictive and enjoyable gameplay in probably one of the best open world games ever made. It's also a Legend of Zelda game, so the gameplay mechanics and challenges are just as timeless as the many other games in the franchise. If you're new to the franchise, you will not regret playing this game one bit.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,6,2018,√âtats-Unis
Is running perfect for now I‚Äôll update if something is wrong but I love it .,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"bought it for the girlfriend, she has so far run around and foraged... made a bunch of different food. 10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game is something of a cross between Skyrim, Minecraft, and a traditional Zelda game. It is beautiful, with impressive visual moods and a killer soundtrack.Perhaps the best part, though, is that it's all about discovery and exploration. You are essentially dropped in with little or no guidance. Gone are the days of a trip hour starter village.If you are a Zelda fan this is a must-have. Wind Waker was my favorite until this came along.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is one of my favorite Zelda games to play!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Might be the best game I've ever played. I seriously haven't enjoyed a game this much in a very long time. Nintendo did a good job of creating an open world game with Zelda elements. It's something like Ocarina of Time crossed with Red Dead Redemption. My biggest complaint is that it rains too much in the game, preventing you from climbing which is a pain in the ass. I'd understand if it rained every once in a while, but it seriously rains every other day...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If you have a Switch, you should have this game. Hands down one of the best games ever created. The world is huge and there are tons of side quests, things to discover, and objects to collect. The only thing I wish it had, was more story based quests. There are technically  4 ""dungeons"" and then the final boss. It does take a significant amount of time to become strong enough to get to the end though.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
Le produit multim√©dia n'a pas pu √™tre charg√©.Great game !!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,9,2021,√âtats-Unis
I was thinking about to return this game cause I can‚Äôt get it through from stage 2. But now I love it. Very smart game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Well now, this caused me to loose my husband for about 3 weeks, but then he was done. He completed all the missions and quests and all the things to do except for find all the korok seeds. He really enjoyed the game. My 4yo liked the riding horses and playing around but the difficulty in fighting was beyond his abilities for sure. Great game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,2,2019,√âtats-Unis
Zelda is my favorite. Up till now Windwaker was my all time favorite. After a week this game is Best Zelda yet!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Wow. Just wow. I have no complaints about this game at all. The physics are fun, the story unfolds in a well done format considering it's open-world. The throwbacks to older games hit the right nostalgia notes (though some can be a bit sad, seeing ruins of places you remember).There is nothing I can say about this game that hasn't been said by reviewers. If they haven't convinced you to get this yet, then why are you wasting time reading this review?",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Great game but not as good as the older ones in my opinion. Too grindy and I tire of it quickly, no real dungeons (divine beasts are mini dungeons at best, very easy and repetitive), The shrines all look the same and are repetitive, bosses all look the same, enemies design is repetitive, Side quests are pointless and no real rewards for them (except Terry town that side quest is great), Korok puzzles repetitive, a lot of content locked behind amiibos, and weapons break way to easily. Now for the positives the game looks amazing, I like the music even if it is minimal in this game, the freedom to play however you want is great. I love how many ways people have come up with to fight or move around in the game. I like the different outfits and being able to dye them.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,11,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If you love classic Nintendo and/or Zelda games, this is a must. Beautiful 3D, well-balanced challenge level, frame rate pretty decent except in the Lost Woods (it's still playable though). My boyfriend beat Ganon completely in the first try, so take that as you will. Music is sparse but very engaging when it's playing.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
Purchased this as a gift and nephew loved it. Was super exited a hen he saw it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Ibmust say this is the first time playing a Zelda game. And I love  how you can go whereever you put your eyes on, climb, swim, run and use horses just to mean aome examples. The world is amazing, the different environmenta in the game can kill you and you must bebprepared with appropiate clothes.The history, to be honest is amazing. For sure will get the 2 expansions.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,9,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Freaking love this game! It feels like Skyrim but with a Nintendo twist. I play it, my wife plays it, and my kids love to watch. It‚Äôs clean but not boring. The puzzles are challenging and the game play is difficult yet rewarding. In my opinion BOTW is the ONLY Zelda game that sits next to Ocarina of Time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"My favorite game for the switch by far. I have been a Zelda fan since the original and this game is by far one of the best Zeldas I have ever played. My favorites is ocarina of time for n64 and this game is better imo, completely free roam open world,  you can beat the game right off the bat or take your rime and gather everything you can before beating the game",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This game is very evolved compared to past zeldas. It is so expansive and there is ao much to do i never get bored. I can decide to search for shrines or work on new recipes or gather ingredients for armor upgrade, always new areas to explore, always side quests always the unexpected treasure or enemy. What?! I didnt know i could set a fire and use the updraft to soar and smash down on enemies. This game is so intelligent. Best game ever. Love it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
Was a little nervous to spend so much on a game cause my kids get bored of them quickly if they are too hard. Both my 6 yr old and my 11 yr old LOVE this game. They played for hours. It‚Äôs their favorite game so far.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
Its a lot of fun and you can either play on your own and make your own adventure or play the story!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,11,2020,√âtats-Unis

This is a great game.  I bought a Nintendo Switch just to play this game.I got this game late 2019.  I was expecting a really good game.This game surprised me. It is better than I expected.Nintendo raised the bar once again and created the best video game ever made.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
Beautiful world is so vast. I almost feel lost. Great to explore,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Out of all the games on the switch, this was by far the best one I have played and the last one. I no longer have the system because I just didn‚Äôt like it, but this game being my first Zelda game was very enjoyable. The world, freedom to explore, do what you want, and story was really well done. I recommend this by a long shot.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
I finished this game on WiiU a couple years ago and now that I have a Switch I happily bought it again.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"It's just a pleasure to explore. You can follow the main quest, but there's a huge amount to do and discover apart from that. Beautiful at 1080p on my 62"" screen and very convenient to go instantly to handheld when I want to.Do consider the separate pro controller if you plan to play on the TV. It's beautifully made and more comfortable to use. It provides more refined control and really make the game more enjoyable.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
One of the best games I play. Arrived on time in good condition.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Por razones de trabajo ya no le dedico tanto tiempo a jugar videojuegos como antes, sin embargo este es el primer juego en muchos a√±os que me hace mantenerme despierto jugando hasta las 6 de la ma√±ana simplemente explorando sus paisajes y sin hacer un progreso real en la trama principal de la historia, en verdad es extremadamente divertido simplemente ir por el mundo explorando que tan alto puedes llegar en esa monta√±a, investigando la forma de domar los caballos salvajes, cocinar experimentando con todos los ingredientes que tienes...Este juego se lo recomiendo a todas las personas que aficionadas a los videojuegos en general, incluso si antes nunca te hab√≠a llamado la atenci√≥n la serie de Zelda, este juego es tan diferente y aporta tantas cosas distintas a la saga que vale la pena darle una oportunidad. Ampliamente recomendable",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2017,Mexique
very love this gameDon't even know what to say,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
Awesome game extremely fun and resale for the game is good tooXD,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I have been a fan of the Zelda series since the original.  This is the best yet. An open world where you control what, when and how you play the game.  It has the elements of the Zelda familiar story lines, but that is a framework for your adventure and not a playbook or schedule.Do things in the order you want or don't.  It is  a true open world game with so many things to do and discover.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"The Legend of Zelda es sin√≥nimo de calidad, definitivamente esta entrega esta a la altura de cualquier otra en la saga. Cuenta con un mundo enorme por explorar y un cambio significativo en la mec√°nica del juego, enemigos con mayor dificultad ( lo mejor de todo ), las f√≠sicas del juego son sorprendentes y los gr√°ficos hermosos, aunque siendo sincero no puedo calificarlo con 5 estrellas debido a que echo en falta esa esencia que todo The Legend of Zelda tiene; No existen los dungeon y la historia no es relatada como en entregas anteriores, ademas de que dejaron de lado la banda sonora por dar √©nfasis al sonido de la ""naturaleza"".Sin lugar a dudas compra segura para todo poseedor de un Nintendo Switch.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,11,2018,Mexique
"A ya casi 1 mes de haber llegado mi pedido estoy muy satisfecho con el juego, apenas empezarlo me fui a enfrentar a Ganon, derrote a las partes malignas de Ganon pero al final el me mat√≥ :c hoy d√≠a eh disfrutado del juego, bastante bueno y s√∫per recomendado comprarlo, me lleg√≥ en perfecto estado sin ning√∫n problema y agradezco al vendedor por enviarlo 10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,9,2020,Mexique

I've played this game for about 60 hours now and I'm still finding entire new areas to explore and new missions. This game has so many layers and so many ways to approach the story. It quickly became my favorite game at home and on the road.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"this game is absolutely amazing, i bought it thinking it‚Äôd be neat to pass time, but i got lost in it so easily. i wish i could go back in time or erase all memories and knowledge i have of the game to experience it again oh my GOD it was great",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Well designed game that has great puzzles and is packed with many, many hours of enjoyment. I am posting this on my third play through of the game. Has good DLC available for the game as well, but it is not necessary to have great experience with this game. I would recommend to anyone with a Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I love the open-world adventure you take as Link to save Hyrule castle, it's really fun and is definitely worth the buy",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
Play some must haves for the Nintendo switch,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Oh I am so sorry! In trying to order this, I apparently  ordered this for a different child LAST year. I saw the order and thought it was for this year. My apologies for an incorrect review. I didn't notice the year, only that it shipped on the 10th of Dec.wow, I am so embarrassed! That is what happens when i shop late at night",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I've been a fan of the series for such a long time and I have played almost every game of the franchise. It's been a wonderful adventure that lasted mora than 200 hours, you'll never get bored. The gameplay, the story, the characters, they are all outstanding. It takes the best of every other Zelda game and brings it into one epic adventure. Exploring Hyrule Castle has been one of the greatest experiences I've had in gaming.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I absolutely adore this game. It‚Äôs like a combination of the best parts from WoW, OoT, other flagship games and some incredible new and creative elements. The main story could be completed quickly, but there‚Äôs so much more to do for side quests or other cool niches. Haven‚Äôt gotten to the DLC yet, but can‚Äôt wait. Biggest complaint is the controls can be wonky and frustrating at times. Well done, Nintendo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
I haven‚Äôt play any Zelda games in my life so I decided to give it a try after all the good reviews on Amazon. After playing this for a month there‚Äôs only one thing to say. ‚Äú i can‚Äôt believe I waited over 2 years to play this masterpiece‚Äù so do yourself a favor and get this ASAP.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"My son previously owned this game for the Wii U, however our system died. When we purchased a switch, he used his used his birthday money to buy this game again. I tried to talk him into a different game that he had not played, but he just loves this game so much. He plays it over and over.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,6,2019,√âtats-Unis
Good,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,9,2021,√âtats-Unis
The product arrived on time and was in perfect condition.I have played several hours or more into the game. The graphics and artstyle is gorgeous. I absolutely love the music. And the story is quite good so far.The map/open world is much bigger than what I had originally thought. And there is plenty of side quests you can do; on top of the main quest.I recommend this to any fan of Zelda.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
Link is extremely resourceful.  I'm amazed at the amount of game that fits on a single cartridge.  It really feels like a real time puzzle instead of obvious hints lying around.  I've had to search around the area and make logical connections.  This is rare in modern gaming.  It sticks to the seek and find aspect of previous Zelda titles.  I'm looking forward to playing more of the 2017 GOTY.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
It‚Äôs my first switch game! Very classic and it could kill a lot of time that you even didn‚Äôt notice that,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I‚Äôve tried in Zelda games in the past and they never really resonated with me. I tried playing this game for a total of 8 hours, but I got bored with it. You spent 75% running around and then there are a few puzzles here and there. I just don‚Äôt have the patience for a game like this. It looks gorgeous though and the map is massive.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Lleg√≥ muy bien y es un excelente juego, de los mejores!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,11,2021,Mexique
"It's a fun game and all, but the world is too massive. That could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the type of gamer you are. When I was younger with more free time, I would have loved that. Unfortunately, now, that seems like a pain. This isn't really a good game to just pick up and play for an hour each day or week. You really need to put time into this game to fully get the fun out of it - otherwise a lot of things just seem like a chore (cooking, refilling supplies/weapons), etc.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The skills and equipment are very comprehensive, the plot is very exciting, I like it very much, and I will recommend it to my friends",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The best Zelda game ever. A must play for every switch owner, and honestly, a reason to buy a switch just on its own. (Unless you have a Wii U) 10/10 would recommend.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
Amazing storyline and great for first time gamers to get used to the perspective. The quality of this game is unbelievable.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,11,2020,√âtats-Unis

"beautiful game, fast shipping, brand new product. what more can you ask for?",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"El juego es muy bueno, no se que mas pueda decir de un Zelda, este al introducir un mundo abierto garantiza cientos de horas de diversi√≥n, ya depender√° de cuanto quieras invertir de tiempo en el juego, pero el mismo no te decepcionara, el env√≠o fue rapid√≠simo al d√≠a siguiente, incluso me dijeron que ya hacen entregas tambi√©n los domingos aqu√≠ en Guadalajara, una excusa mas para ser miembro prime, son de esas pocas veces que realmente sientes que una membres√≠a si te da un valor agregado, y en este caso Amazon no me ha decepcionado. Les dejo un par de fotos para que puedan apreciar el producto y unas comparaci√≥n del juego con una moneda de cinco pesos para que tengan una idea concreta de su tama√±o.Totalmente recomendable.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2017,Mexique
Amazing game that manages to improve on what has made Zelda over the years so fun to play. First time since Ocarina of Time on the Nintendo 64 that I‚Äôve been so excited to play and discover the world; feels like being a kid again!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I have never spent significant time on any previous Zelda game, so I can't speak to how well this holds to the formula... but I love this game. It's absolutely beautiful, has great depth of features and plenty of content.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
Was late on this one. Perhaps my favorite game ever.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"As everyone says, the world is beautiful, very open and lots of fun to explore. I'd say it's probably worth it, especially if you already have some emotional connection to the franchise. Personally, I might not keep playing. Things I dislike:-The climbing controls haven't been working well for me. I keep falling off of a large tower at the very beginning because the climb down option doesn't appear unless you face the wall at the edge, but if you drop from there you miss the next platform down.-When trying to focus on a spot to shoot an arrow or mark a spot on the map, the camera jiggles. I dislike this.-Everything I have encountered can either be killed very easily or can kill me very easily. There is no middle ground.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Es una delicia. Jugu√© 200 horas para encontrar todos los santuarios, una tercera parte de los kologs y conseguir las bestias divinas y acabar con Ganon. Pero a√∫n estoy lejos de terminarlo. Este juego te ofrece absoluta libertad de exploraci√≥n pero te mantiene interesado porque siempre hay una misi√≥n que cumplir, una prueba heroica que superar, algo qu√© buscar. Yo no he comprado el DLC pero seguramente lo har√© porque es el mejor juego que he jugado. Una verdadera obra de amor a los videojuegos. Y anoto algo importante: este es el primer Zelda que juego. As√≠ de bueno est√°.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,6,2019,Mexique
My husband & I loved this game! Super Fun!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2021,√âtats-Unis

It's a great game that speaks for itself.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Best video game ever! I like that it‚Äôs a longer game than other Switch games, and when u finish the whole story mode, it‚Äôs still fun to run around doing random things. Recommend to everyone, child or adult, love this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
I didn't play Zelda Breath of the Wild until over a year after it was released. The reviews or hearsay cannot do this game justice. It's 2019 as I write this review and I still can't stop thinking about Breath of the Wild. It cam in great condition and this was a purchase I'd make again and again and again.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2019,√âtats-Unis
"It is seriously addictive! Do not buy if you wish to get a good night sleep! LOLMy husband and I start to play after our son goes to sleep, and find ourself hooked to the TV screen for hours. We usually end up not even playing the story, but exploring around the different regions of the Zelda world, collecting food and bugs and cooking them, while vandalizing the homes of monsters who are just happily dancing around the camp fire.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"The delivery speed is very fast, the quality is very good, I like it very much, the price is also good, I suggest to buy.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,9,2020,√âtats-Unis

"I bought this for my 11 year old daughter and she LOVES it! My brother also loves it, so they fight over it when he visits :)",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Played for two weeks, starting to loose my patience&interest. It was kinda boring, too much reading, weapons break frequently, constantly changing weapons during fight, worst of all, the map was so big that takes too long to get to the destination, I guess the only thing that amused me would be the horse, it makes me feel riding a horse is like cursing in a Ferrari...",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,10,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I honestly fell in love the moment I started playing it. The game is so beautifully made and seems almost endless. The quests are challenging, but fun at the same time. And it requires some thought and strategy as well.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
I opened the video Christmas morning and no tape was inside! It was sealed though! I want a replacement please,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,12,2020,√âtats-Unis

"I didn't think I would like this one, but it's like wind walker and twilight princess combined with a few new additions. Great game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
Came on time and enjoying my favorite game series.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Este es un juego obligatorio para cualquier fan de la serie The Legend of Zelda. Nintendo cre√≥ una obra maestra con este juego. Visualmente es hermoso a pesar de que el nintendo switch no se caracteriza por su poder gr√°fico. El mapa por explorar es enorme, la variedad de armas, items, materiales para crear pociones y alimentos me encant√≥, puedes crear todo tipo de comidas para recuperar vida. La inteligencia de los enemigos es buena y hay algunos que son realmente un reto para derrotar. La verdad no hay algo malo que pueda decir de este juego.No recomiendo jugarlo en modo port√°til. El juego es tan grande y con tantos detalles que se pierde calidad de juego al jugarlo en una pantalla peque√±a",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,12,2017,Mexique
"Good:-The shrines are amazing. I've heard there are over 100 in the game. I found around 10 in my time with the game and all of them were fun, clever and original.-The world is vast and beautiful.  Hunting and searching for materials is fun and addictive.Bad:-The combat is frustrating and annoying.  Any regular enemy can kill you with two hits, but they can take significant damage before dying.  What makes things worse, the weapons break with extreme ease.  Not only that, but defeating enemy camps is often not worth it.  I would use three weapons to clean out the camp, to get one weapon from the chest.  Furthermore, Link doesn't earn experience points from fighting.  So it is easier to simply avoid the camps.  Anyhow, I hope this helps.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
I liked the colors used in the game that glow with this Zelda world is luxuriously designed with such surreal graphics the characters world are wonderful as well must have this game contends as greatest game ever,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Worth buying the Switch for. Its a ambient exploration puzzle game. The levels are well thought out, challenging, and a neat twist on the Zelda franchise in general as it combines many elements from various past games, and does so in a clever way through story telling.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
My son enjoys this game because the game is open worlds and there is no storyline.  He enjoys playing it on his Nintendo Switch.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
"very unique and different zelda game, full of endless possibilities and also full of a lot of empty space sometimes. stick to quest and its an amazing game but exploring can get redundant and boring sometimes. however i will admit when you explore sometimes you run into these giant dragons and stuff and thats gotta be the most mind blowing experience in a game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
Best game I have played in 20 years. They absolutely nailed everything. And the game is massive. The puzzles and quests are super fun. You could spend hundreds of hours in there and still have stuff to do. I recommend getting the DLC right away as there are a few things that can help you right away. Would give 10 stars.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,2,2019,√âtats-Unis
"El juego es bastante prometedor, no importa si eres nuevo en la saga o veterano te diviertes much√≠simo al inicio cuando ve√≠a los v√≠deos de jugabilidad no me convenc√≠a pero ya que tienes uno en tus manos exploras todo un mundo, tiene jefes bastante fuertes pero una vez que le tomas ritmo y practica puedes con ellos.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2020,Mexique
This game is nearly perfect. I've spent over 80 hours playing it; I barely completed the main story. The world is huge. One could spend literally hours just exploring the world and still only see a fraction of it. I love the open ended nature of it. You can do the game in any order you want. It was the first game I've played in a very long time where I didn't want to put the controller down.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
Game came in a timely manner and is exactly what was expected. Great quality.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,2,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Such a great RPG. Huge world. So much to do. Lots of puzzles, action, and fun. Between the main quests, side quests, and just goofing around, this game has it all. Hundreds of hours of play potential. Worth every penny.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Excelente, tal como lo describe el vendedor. Me dice mi hijo, que es el mejor juego.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game i wanna give it a 10... but i can only give it a 9.8... mainly just cause of the music style... it works but, just miss those epic tracks and with a world that makes twilight princess and wind wakers maps look like nothing... the theme when your around hyrule castle they could of done music like that for the whole game imo but, regardless the games style, charm and charter more then make up for it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
bow go pew pew,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,8,2021,√âtats-Unis
"The exploration aspects are fantastic, and I love getting myself lost and still finding things.  There are consistently interesting things to do and places in the distance that I want to go to.I have not completed the game yet, but I'm just enjoying everything I do so much that it doesn't really matter.  The combat is interesting, and it is very satisfying hitting the trigger for getting a Flurry Rush, deflecting attacks with your shield, and catching boomerangs.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
It was a gift for our grandson and he loved it!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Easily the best game in the Zelda Series.  My 6 year old daughter and I played through together.  We both loved it!  The story is intriguing and the gameplay mechanics are probably the smoothest I have ever seen.  If you own a Switch, this is a must have!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,9,2019,√âtats-Unis

This game was so awesome especially with being able to explore the world on your own. I highly enjoyed playing this and in fact could not put it down. I would get off work and play this game skipping dinner because it was so addicting. Can't wait for the next Zelda to come out!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,8,2019,√âtats-Unis

"Already so excited to start playing this game! Everything from the music, the creative, artistic style, the deep character building- it's the best kind of overwhelming! I've watched my friends play this on their Nintendo Switches, and now I finally get a crack! This game shipped faster than my actual console- so it will remain in its case until that day! Again, very eager to play and see where this game goes from a development and DLC standpoint!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Uno de los mejores juegos de la consola, largo, extenso, con muchas opciones, misiones secundarias.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I have never enjoyed a Zelda game as much since Ocarina of Time, and Link To The Past. This game is Huge and a bit overwhelming and intimidating at times. There are some parts that are repetitive, but overall the game is a masterpiece and a true work of art! Be prepared to invest hours and hours of time on this game. This is the first open world Zelda game and it is a beautiful world you will enjoy exploring.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Game came in great condition and is an amazing Zelda title if you haven‚Äôt played it yet! Detailed and open world it is one I‚Äôd highly recommended to any Zelda fan.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,5,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Realmente o jogo faz jus √† fama. √â realmente muito bom! Vale a pena o investimento, pois n√£o √© barato. O jogo √© 100% em ingl√™s e n√£o √© dos mais f√°ceis de jogar, ent√£o n√£o recomendaria para crian√ßas ou para pessoas que n√£o entendam ingl√™s.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2021,Br√©sil

"One of the best games I have ever played. The open world is packed with things to do(unlike most open world games). Looking for towers and shrines is a fun process, and finally finding one is oh so satisfying. The map is not restricted at all, so you can just go to the final boss(just to be murdered in the process). It's a true masterclass in game design and a must buy for every switch owner. It is worth buying a switch for.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2019,Inde
"I am an old school Zelda fan.  The game took a little for me to get used too, weapons breaking, cooking food, etc.  However, once I got used to it, the vast size of the game and what seems like endless areas to explore has me engulfed in the Zelda universe.  30 hours in with no end in sight, cannot wait to see what DLCs are coming later in the year.  Well done Nintendo, well done.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm not a big gamer anymore, I grew up playing Zelda, final fantasy...etc. but as an adult I basically lost interest. My 9 year old son loves all Zelda games so I bought him a switch and breath of the wild for his birthday and immediately we were both addicted.

"Honestly the best game I have played in a long time! Days worth of storyline gameplay and months worth of additional quests! The map is huge, detailed, and beautiful!!I have found no flaws with this game and play constantly. I am trying to find all of the Koroks!The DLC expansion pack is awesome but unessential if you do not want to spend extra.I highly recommend giving this game a go!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
thanks for the great product,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Even if you‚Äôre not a longtime Zelda fan, this game is an incredible experience. This is the RIGHT way to do open worlds. You will experience some performance issues in Korok forest though and other NPC dense areas of the game when in handheld mode, but other than that it‚Äôs a great experience.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Nuevamente Nintendo lo ha hecho, ha creado una obra maestra despu√©s de tantos a√±os con la saga de Zelda, este Zelda se siente tan diferente pero al mismo tiempo tan familiar, tiene una historia profunda e interesante, como juego de mundo abierto, es f√°cil perderse, pero as√≠ tambi√©n es sencillo volver al sendero de la historia principal el mundo es ENORME, llevo 5 semanas jugandolo y pienso terminarlo (con coleccionables), las voces (Ingles y Japones), los personajes y como se desarrolla la trama lleva justo la forma que tu le das, e incluso en el orden que tu quieras, uno de los mejores juegos que Nintendo ha tenido la osad√≠a de crear.Por cualquier precio al que adquieras este juego, vale cada peso o centavo que hayas pagado por el.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,5,2017,Mexique

This game makes me feel I made up the lost in money from buying 1-2 switch in that I will be getting my money's worth times 2! Its a extremely well made game that is easy to play and not as complicated as other RPGs. I recommend this game to all Switch owners.Update: The problem now is I oinly play Breathe of the Wild and the other 5 games I have I dont have the time for. Its that good!!!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

So much to do in this game and it's so immersive. The creators put so much attention to detail. Easily my favorite game I've ever played.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The game is beautiful!  Though there are still some glitches,  mainly just hair clipping through the body and sometimes the bosses are invisible till you hit them.  But those are so rare and dont ruin the experience AT ALL!  I HIGHLY recomend if you like open world games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
Qu√© m√°s puedo decir los verdaderos gamers sabemos qu√© es un gran juego lleg√≥ en buen estado.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,11,2021,Mexique
Game came as advertised. Very fun to play!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Definitely worth your time. I've been a Legend of Zelda fan since for many years, but this one is different from basically all previous titles, in a good way. Great story, great characters, and a great experience playing.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Quite literally, this is the greatest Zelda game made to date. Without any spoilers, this is by far one of the most groundbreaking RPG's of all time as well. I am completely blown away by everything this game has to offer. If you are even thinking about this game or have any interest in what a game like this has to offer, just pull the trigger and GET THIS!So crazy, so fun, so much to do and so groundbreaking!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

Nothing less to say how great I left when zelda was announced on nintendo switch it does live up to the expectations.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
Great game. So much to do. Can spend all day playing the game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"My kids can play this game for hours. I like it because it is quiet, compared to other battle games. The graphics are really beautiful too.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
One of the best Zelda games of all time!  Only downside is that you can't have multiple saved games in the same account.  You would need to create another nintendo account to replay the game without losing your previous progress.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This Zelda game truly redefines the classic Zelda experience.  It has all the things I love about Zelda games -- puzzles, dungeons, action -- but re-frames them in an open-world format.  I could spend (and have spent) countless hours exploring the vivid, varied, and beautiful landscapes of this game.  The amount of detail is truly astounding.  If you like Zelda games, or honestly any RPG, Breath of the Wild is for you.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Open world games are amazing, but they can be overwhelming too. I have played every Zelda game prior except for Skyward Sword. This game is unlike any of the others. It will give you plenty of play time and you can explore all you want without feeling pressured to do anything. The world is huge with secrets hidden everywhere.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I think ever since he opened this Christmas morning, he's played it for at least a little everyday. I am even hooked now! The puzzles are brilliant, the graphics are stunning, and there are almost no limits to what and where you can explore. Honestly, one of my favorite games I've ever played or watched someone else play.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,1,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This game is beyond beautiful. It is stunning with graphics and the amount of stuff to do and collect. Awesome game. Deserves higher than five stars. If you own a switch, you HAVE to own this game. It is a necessity. Whether new to the series or an old time fan, this game will bring new exciting adventures. Even if you didn't like past Zelda games, you will enjoy this game a whole lot!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I bought this for my teenage son for Christmas and he enjoyed it so much, he played it every day of his school break. The graphics are great and it has a really good story.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Really extraordinary game.  Wish the world had a few more roaming creatures instead of spawn locations but that is the only minor grep.  I played over 80hrs.  There is so much to do in the game and the visuals are amazing for a handheld device. I'm just glad I""m done.  No I can go back to a regular sleep schedule!!  Oh wait there is new DLC....oh boy.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
It arrived on time and works great love it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I consider myself more of a casual gamer, but holy crap! I got sucked into this game!  The imagery is beautiful. The main quest and side quests are awesome.  The updates add new levels of challenge. I play it again and again!  There‚Äôs so much to explore and do!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,5,2019,√âtats-Unis
It's the game. 10/10 game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
My some plays it everyday,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
"It's a fun game, could have been great, but the over world is super boring and empty, the fights are very one dimensional with only a little variation based on player ingenuity, and it still had a healthy dose of nintendo restrictions that I didn't have in other better games of the same type. And while the art and graphics look very good, they sometimes don't mix, becoming an eyesore. It's a good game and in the right direction, but this kinda gme should have been thought of and released about 7-10 years ago as a stepping stone to something better like a lot of other open world games on the market.I will praise the detail though. They thought of a lot when putting in the nintendo polish.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
Best game ever,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
An other-worldly experience that consistently takes your breath away.  My wife and I have each played over 120 hours each and we still enjoy diving back into the engrossing world Nintendo has created.  The music is also very underrated in my opinion.  Several of the arrangements are simply stunning and when combined with what's happening on screen have the ability to send shivers down your spine.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Holy smokes, this game is awesome!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
Excelente compra,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"One of the best games I have ever played. If you are a Zelda fan, get it. If you are a RPG fan, get it. If you are an open world fan, get it. If you like video games in general, get it. This game is simply amazing and has so much to do, i can't imagine not buying this. I am a huge zelda fan and it exceeds my expections. Game of the year.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"It would be easier to say what's wrong with this game than what's right.So what exactly is wrong with it?Nothing.If you enjoy Zelda games, then buy this game; if you don't like Zelda games, then buy this game.  I cannot think of a person who would not enjoy this game.  The developers really focused on making a game that was fun before anything else, and sadly that is a rarity these days.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"It takes a little bit to figure out the game at first but when you do, WOW! There's so much to do and you'll want to play for hours and hours. The map is huge! This is a must buy regardless of the price.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I've enjoyed most Zelda's (not a huge fan of twilight princess) and this game was definitely a new take on the classic Zelda universe.  If you are into exploration and open-world experiences, go for it.  If you prefer linear story design (which there is nothing wrong with that format) you may not enjoy it as much.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Purchased this game and the switch as a way to wind down after a long day. Throw some headphones on, listen to all of the small background noises, and be prepared to be blown away with the graphics and storyline. Fun to play even if you have just 5 minutes of time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,4,2019,√âtats-Unis
Its my new favorite game love it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"IMO, this is the best the Switch has to offer so far.  The open world concept is awesome.  Constant exploring and mini-quests/side quests to keep you busy for hours and hours and hours.  If you are a Link fan, this is the best entry so far.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Hands down one of the best games I have had the privilege to play. From the design, the story, the physics, the scope and breadth of the the game's world, the art... Nintendo have crafted a masterpiece. The number of tiny details is staggering, and the massive world feels vibrant and alive. If I were asked to give a current example of : 'video games as art', I would show this.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I got this game for my best friend for his birthday; he loved it! Maybe a little too much because all he wants to do is play it now... but hey that‚Äôs on him, not the game. 10/10 would recommend!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Way more detailed than the original Zelda, that's for sure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2021,√âtats-Unis

Great game!!! Anyone who says it‚Äôs boring just doesn‚Äôt have any patience or skill with games that require thought. Keep your meals fully stocked and you rarely have to cook....,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,4,2020,Canada
"Los juegos de Zelda siempre valen la pena por lo incre√≠ble que es el mundo. Es un juego largo, complicado y con much√≠simo que hacer y mucha historia. Son juegos donde hay una meta final y muchas metas peque√±as y adem√°s cosas que puedes hacer solo porque quieres hacerlas. En verdad es uno de esos juegos que valen lo que pagas.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,7,2020,Mexique
"Best Zelda game made. I have played most zelda games and this one js by far my favorite one. Its ""open air"" turned out to be very exiting and fun and with over 50 hours in im still discovering new things to do. The game does not give you any hints of what to do or how to do it, and most is left for ou to find out. It is deffinately a musy have!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
Excelente juego uno de los mejores de Nintendo por a√±os no te vas arrepentir gran gran t√≠tulo a√∫n no han hechale algo que lo supere,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,7,2021,Mexique

Amazing game play and immersive world experience. Sometimes got a little tedious and the boss battles could have been more challenging but still the best game I‚Äôve played on Switch. 10/10 must own,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Before I tried this game, I was skeptical and wished for the fanboys to just shut up about it.  But now I'm the one shutting up.  The open world is beautifully rendered, despite it not having the 4K photo realism of Uncharted 4 for example.  And now I must shut up again, so you can go play it.  Go now and play it!  It's incredible!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"El juego lleg√≥ bien, bien empaquetado y estoy muy contenta ya lo estoy jugando, no fue necesario descargar nada, solo le incerte el juego y ya lo estoy jugando, el pedido llegaba en dos d√≠as pero al final lo recib√≠ un d√≠a antes de lo esperado como siempre Amazon no me falla üòÉ",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,11,2020,Mexique
"Fantastic game. A total time-suck, but I think the purchase of the Nintendo Switch was worth it for just this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Can't say more than what you have read. Play this before you die. I dont even want to beat it. I just walk around exploring and being happy. Gorgeous game. Best game I've played in years. And BTW, couldn't be happier with my Switch console. And I am not a Nintendo fan boy. My favorite game are Ki for Xbox one and Uncharted  4 for PS4.Update: Hands down the best game I have ever played.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is one of the best games ever.  Game play is challenging enough for my son yet simple enough that I can play too (albeit not nearly as coordinated as he). It has awakened the kid in me again.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This game is open world but it‚Äôs still a Zelda game with beautiful scenery,loveable characters and challenging monsters. You will die a lot and sometimes get frustrated with the puzzles but those were always a dynamic in the Zelda series! My kids have also enjoyed this game especially the making food.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2019,√âtats-Unis
A must have for your switch. A true masterpiece!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I‚Äôve had the Switch and Zelda for a week now. I absolutely had to grab this game to see what all the fuss was about. I‚Äôll be truthful, I‚Äôve only spent about 2-3 hours with it, but I understand why it‚Äôs already a classic. Perfect game to start my collection!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
It didn't get Game of the Year for nothing!Zelda style adventuring meets open world design. One of the most intuitive games I have ever played.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Great game all around.  It took me a bit longer than most to get truly into this game since the mechanisms used in this particular game are so different from past entries in the series.  But after completing quests, finding secrets, and generally exploring so much of the expansive world, I really like the game and am very happy I made the purchase (technically before I even bought my Switch).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
Amazing game.  I love how open ended and non linear the game play is.  I don‚Äôt think I will get sick of playing it anytime soon.  The graphics are also unbelievable.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
This is a fantastic open world RPG for the switch. It‚Äôs hours of gameplay packed into the game.I would expect most people to enjoy this on the big screen rather than on handheld mode.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"This is an amazing, well designed, beautiful game. There are battles, puzzles, and enough levels to keep people of various ages interested for a very long time. We have many Switch games and this one is my favorite.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
Amazing game. If you‚Äôre a fan of Zelda I don‚Äôt need to tell you this game is a landmark in the franchise. If you‚Äôre new to the adventures of Link this adventure-filled epic is a great introduction to the series.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This game, wow. It's something special. Really, I mean really fun to explore the world that they have created. There's always something to find over that ridge or atop that cliff if you decide to take the time to explore. Granted open world games have taken this approach before, but where this game excels is how it leaves you open to discover and figure out physics based environmental puzzles on your own. They are literally scattered everywhere.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I'm a completionist so I bought it (and the switch) to try and get it to 100%, even though I already finished it on my friend's Switch.You can spend hours and hours and it doesn't get boring.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"10 Things to consider before buying this game:1. Are you a human?2. Or an alien?3. Or anything really?4. Do you consider yourself mentally stable?5. Or unstable?6. Do you appreciate fun?7. Are you a gamer?8. Are you not a gamer?9. Is your name Jos√©?10. Is your name not Jos√©?If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this game is for you.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

I bought this for the Wii U and loved it. Now it have a switch and I knew I had to have it for what it was meant to play from. Still a gorgeous and fun time consuming game. Zelda at it's best and most expanded.The first and best true Legend of Zelda RPG. The only thing it's missing is the 3-4 party team lol.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2018,√âtats-Unis

Im so addicted!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
"The dungeons in this zelda game are nothing like any previous zelda. The dungeons (sadly only 4) are fantastic! The DLC promises a 5th dungeon, which I am looking forward to. The use of the Sheika Slate's powers are very unique and nothing like any previous zelda game. The slate's powers are fun to use. The open world in this game is beautiful and enormous! Any Zelda fan will quickly get hooked on this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"my whole family loves this game.a very lengthy quest.we spent a lot of time completing it.about gameplay no need to say anything,internet is full with reviews of this remarkable game..zelda games are the star attraction of nintendo platform.awakens memories of playing zelda on older nintendo systems.must buy if you own a nintendo switch and if you dont own a nintendo switch then purchase the console solely  to play this game.games like zelda on nintendo or god of war on ps4 are the main reason that people buy these consoles.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,10,2018,Inde
"This game is a revolution in the gaming community. It breaks ground on so many levels that it is really jaw-dropping. It is always surprising me even on multiple playthroughs. If you buy this game, you won't regret it. It's so nice to see a game that doesn't involve blowing someone's head off every 30 seconds. Master pieces are possible.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
Fun game exactly what was expected good condition,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is phenomenal. The open world feature in a Legend of Zelda game seemed a bit sketchy at first, but the more I played the game, the more I realized that in fact, it still feels like Legend of Zelda. Some things have changed, but nothing has been ruined by it. Everything is so immersive and pulls you in to the experience. Definitely the best game I've ever played.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Somehow EXCEEDS the hype--the greatest video game ever. Period. Freedom to go go everywhere you look; unbelievable combat system; poignant story; gorgeous cell-shaded graphics; tons of meaningful upgrades. Endless things to do. And the sheer joy of exploration. The game leaves me alternatingly breathlessly (ha) ecstatic and speechless. Switch is an incredible system, but it would be worth it even if it weren't just for this game. Wow. Just wow.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"No need for a huge review this game explains itself. Beautiful views, amazing gameplay and huge map to explore. You're going to get hours on top of hours. And if you get the DLC pack that's going to add you even more.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,10,2019,√âtats-Unis

Best game of 2017 for a reason. Have over 50 hours of gameplay and I'm not even halfway done with the game. Spending time exploring is very rewarding and the best part of the game. The package arrived on time and there was no issue with the game cartage.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,7,2019,√âtats-Unis

"El env√≠o excelente. Lleg√≥ muy r√°pido.El precio muy bien, lo encontr√© con descuento. Intent√© comprar uno para mi novio pero al parecer limitaron la venta a un juego por persona.Respecto al juego en s√≠, nada qu√© decir. Es una JOYA, vale cada centavo. Y eso que no me considero gamer. Muy amigable para quienes nunca hab√≠amos jugado las ediciones anteriores.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,7,2020,Mexique
This is probably the best game I‚Äôve ever played. This brought back all the magic of the original game. Finally a 3D game where the combat is fun. You could play this over 100 hours and still be excited to play it every day. I can‚Äôt say that about any other single player game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,2,2019,√âtats-Unis

"Ended up getting the game somewhere else but I have put a ton of hours into this and it is an amazing experience. The only other title I played that was Zelda was Wind Waker on the DS light at least ~6 years ago; I did get bored of that after a couple dungeons. With this, I feel like unlocking everything!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I absolutely love this game, literally the ONLY reason I bought a Switch. Beautifully animated, and a great overall adventure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,9,2020,√âtats-Unis

"so far the game works like a charm. its a beautiful game, the youtube videos dont really do it justice. everything looks so crisp and colorful. much more detailed than i imagined. it has rare framerate drops in docked mode in certain tall grass but its not all the time or a big drop making it unplayable or anything. just a random little drop in frames on very rare occasions. its honestly a fantastic game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I love this game with all my heart. It has been one of the longest games I have ever played and the amount of things I have done in it are absurd.

Not much of a gamer but THIS GAME. I highly recommend. I'm so addicted to it rn. Also Amazon is where I found the cheapest price for this game. I was looking around for a while too.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
Excellent game according to my 10 year old.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
Looks great and keeps the CPU cool. It blocks the first slot for memory so I have to use the 2 back slots now. The cooler will have to be replaced if I decide to buy more.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I have about 30 hours in and anticipate another 30 hours before I start on other games. For me, zelda games offer a great story but with little difficulty. This game changes that. I have died over 50 times and still find challenging enemies in the wild. It plays well in handheld or docked. I have had no glitches or crashes. The game is a masterpiece and critics agree. I cant say enough about it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

Great game have played it through like 5 times,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I can say no more, this is a MUST HAVE! I absolutely love this game, but my one complaint is that it is kind of confusing and misleading. After you get your paraglider, it will tell you to go fight Gannon. DO NOT DO THIS! You will be too weak and die if you fight him after getting the glider. Go kill all of the Divine Beasts, and THEN go kill Gannon.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
Great game for Link and Zelda,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Game is very deep with plenty of gameplay.  I'm enjoying every single minute of it.  With the Switch, this game is instant on/off with no load time allowing you to pick it up and play quickly when you have a few minutes to spare.  Same with turning it off.  You just turn it off and pickup where you left of without needing to save.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Love it! This game has helped me to know the wonderfully unique experience of freezing to death on a mountain top, while desperately searching for anything flammable I can burn for some warmth.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
This was the best purchase I ever made. I play this game ALL THE TIME it‚Äôs so worth it you never really run out of things to do and even when i finished i just restart and do it all again. it‚Äôs a wonderfully fun story and game it‚Äôs so beautiful anyone can appreciate it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,11,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Great open world full of quiet moments and big discoveries. The journey towards the end is what makes this game special. This is a must for any Zelda fan.

"The best Zelda yet. Manages to solve all of the usual downfalls of open world games. Exploration is fun again--breakable weapons ensure that you always find meaningful loot, even if it's a weaker weapon, it can still be used on weaker enemies to save the durability of your stronger weapons. The story and atmosphere are breathtaking, and the world is beautifully designed. This is a game we'll be talking about for years to come.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is my 2nd Switch game, and it is an amazing game, all the amazing reviews it has are correct, and I still have a ton of story left, the gameplay is amazing, the story is great, the graphics are awesome. I would definitely recommend this to be your 1st or 2nd game to get for your Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
Just bought a switch lite 3 months ago. This game has always been in the top 10 rpg lists for the last 2 years. Great o be able to play this game when on the go.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

It was fun and good,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
This is the best video game of all time hands down. If you own a switch and don't own this game that should be considered criminal. This game is a classic on par with the heavy hitting classics such as ocarina and winwaker,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is the only reason to buy a switch...  the game is awesome...  main benefit for me is you don't start out as some little link kid, the game has video and spoken audio as well as the traditional text, you can save the game literally anywhere, and it's open world...Only somewhat of a con for me would be the cartoonish graphics.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Master piece of zelda,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
Truly amazing game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
Great game.  It‚Äôs a good mix of playing styles somewhere between Fable and other Zelda games.  We can‚Äôt stop playing it.  If you‚Äôre a Zelda fan you‚Äôll love this one.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The item was delivered on time, sealed and contains the game cartilage inside.First time to play A Zelda game and it is amaaaazing so far, the graphics are astonishing",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"TES in HyrulePerfectionOnly thing I would improve would be to have actual dungeons along with the Shrines.  It wouldn't have to be the 8 or 9 we're used to, just like 3-4 of them granting some kind of unbreakable item(s) used to help with exploration ""unlocking"" areas by granting access due to the utility of the item.  The items would also have some kind of combat use.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Even after 3 years when it was released, this is still an awesome game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
I'm not far in the game but am enjoying my time with it.There's no hand holding tutorials so a lot of things you have to figure out through trial & error.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Great game, lots to do! I love the puzzles in each of the caves, some can be quit difficult, but a greats sense of satisfaction once you figure it out. The world is beautiful, lots to explore.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
This game was very very fun and the 720p looks like 4K in the switch screen. For me it looked better undocked. The reasons my review is not 5 stars and only 4 is that the climbing and open landscapes can sometimes get tedious but anyways it is still worth every penny and was a system seller for me,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Got this for my nephews b-day! He loves it so far, plays it everyday and the best part is he hasn‚Äôt beaten it in a weeks time like he‚Äôs does with most games smh. No problems with the disk or gaming! Thank you!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,9,2019,√âtats-Unis
The product arrived on time and works!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
Everything a real zelda fan could want. A story with more depth and is less linear. You can beat it in 2 hours or 200. No one to tell you the best way to play it and hopefully the scum that try to wont succeed. If you want a linear story and standard Zelda gameplay go play Skyward Sword. If you want to play the best game in my lifetime get Breath of the Wild.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Great game you can get lost for hours playing,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"If you own a Switch, this is one game that you must buy.  My 10 year old said he does not know what to do with his life now that he has finished the game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"No regrets with this wonderful game.  It's different from the tried and true formula of past versions, however it does not disappoint.  It's incredibly detailed, and those little touches I continue to find never fail to impress and amuse.  My only negatives would be my bias from playing all the previous games and missing the full dungeons and wonderful music, as this latest version is somewhat lacking in those areas.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Adventures, puzzles, exploration the new Zelda has got it all.  Expect to put alot of  hours into this game cause you'll love exploring.  The shrine puzzles are very satisfying to solve, though the gyroscopic puzzles can be a bit annoying.  This iteration feels much more immersive having to adjust clothing for swimming, sneaking and weather elements and the like.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
Absolutely amazing game! This game alone makes the Switch worth it. There are many other amazing games of course. But this one really immerses you into the world of Hyrule.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
First game in a while that I‚Äôve been so excited about playing and I was not let down. I‚Äôve been a Zelda fan for quite a while and was really stoked to get it. Highly Recommend,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Me llego en buen tiempo del horario antes de las 8 pm , pero aun si tienes que ser paciente cuando ordenas algo ya con el juego de Zelda es muy adictivo en cuarentena ya no te aburres y compre su ""DLC"" para completar y sus tarjetas de Amiibo para comenzar esta gran aventura , divi√©rtete y cu√≠date...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,8,2020,Mexique
"Definitely the best Zelda yet. This game alone probably isn't enough to justify buying the Switch, but if you do, you will NOT be disappointed. Playing this game for around 15 hours now, I constantly find myself saying ""Oh, that's cool!"" If you are a fan of open world games, you will like this one. I constantly find myself either exploring in the opposite direction of quest markers, or completely ignoring the markers all-together.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Best game I‚Äôve ever played hands down,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2021,√âtats-Unis

"A full review of this game would be...long. Long and full of screaming.This is my first Zelda game and I could not be happier with this introduction into the series. From the first cutscene, I knew I had a new fandom.Literally my only complaint is Zelda's voice. Oh, fantasy british...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,12,2018,√âtats-Unis

The best video game I have ever played. Beautiful graphics and animation. Beautiful music.The only two minor negatives are:*** SPOILER ALERT ****** SPOILER ALERT ****** SPOILER ALERT ***+ I wish there were a couple huge traditional dungeons like in previous Zeldas. I'd play through another Water Temple!+ It is a bit light on story elements. I wish there were more cut scenes and back story.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I am constantly amazed by the attention to detail in this game. There is so much to do it never gets boring. I love that there is no prescribed order to do things in. I was worried that that would take away from the way I am used to playing Legend of Zelda games, but it really hasn't. I can't say enough good things about this game. Go buy a copy!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Greatest Zelda game ever made, hands down. If you own a Nintendo switch, this game needs to be a part of your game collection. Everything was done right and I‚Äôm playing through it again as if the game is brand new and just as fun.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Zelda tells you very little. You have to figure things out on your own using small, useful hints. I set myself on fire trying to cook an apple. Awesome.Anytime you die, it's typically your fault, but you learn for next time, and try again shortly before you died. The difficulty is hard, but fair. Two hours into the game and it's one of the best Zelda experiences I've ever had.10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This is by far the best game on the Nintendo Switch. It‚Äôs so immersive, expansive, and there are so many optional/hidden side quests that keep me playing this game long after beating it. Beautiful graphics, music, and character design. This is right up there with Ocarina of Time for my favorite Zelda game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
Great game. Love it so much,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I am A major fan of the zelda franchise have been since the nes days but as the nostalgia is almost non existant they have taken alot of what made zelda, Zelda away. The concept is ok the weapons breaking with no option to repair is stupid. The master sword even has no nostalgia. It is easy to acquire but doesnt really serve a purpose. I still play it occasionally but only cause i paid for it. Once i beat this game I most likely will never play it again. I paid for the dlc but i may not even bother with it once it is released. I feel this is the end of the line for zelda in my opinion. I wouldnt be surprised if no more zelda games were made.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
I liked the part where I completely forgot that I had to work and just spent a week glued to this game. Lost my job of course. 11/10 would recommend to any disgruntled employee.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

"The legend of Zelda breath of the wild se a convertido f√°cilmente en el mejor Zelda de los √∫ltimos a√±os y esto es debido a que por fin la franquicia dej√≥ atr√°s su viejo y desgastado esquema. En esta ocasi√≥n nos presentan un mundo gigantesco y completamente abierto donde t√∫ tomar√°s las riendas de a donde quieras dirigirte, donde tendr√°s que cocinar para recuperar energ√≠a, tus armas se desgastaran y terminar√°n rompi√©ndose y el clima jugar√° casi siempre en tu contra. Todas estas mec√°nicas the legend of Zelda las toma prestadas de otros juegos como elders scrolls. A su vez la dificultad de este juego es bastante elevada si lo comparamos con otros juegos de la misma serie. Este definitivamente es un juego distinto que no puedes dejar pasar.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,7,2017,Mexique
"I haven't had so much fun and excitement playing a new Zelda since Twilight Princess came out. This is truly a modern Zelda game, taking the core that we love from other games and doing something new with it. Fans of the series and newcomers ought to at least try playing it, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,7,2018,√âtats-Unis

"It's a great game, my son loves it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
Very good game. I am a fan of the Zelda series. The only thing i would say is that for me at least the first few hours are very boring. If you can get past those first few hours then is starts feeling like a normal Zelda game. Otherwise one of my favorite Zeldas so far.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
This is by far the best zelda game yet. So much fun playing this I can't put it down.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I cannot even think of another game that made explore it as much as I did with this one. This game is mesmerizing, and utterly beautiful.

"This game is truly amazing! After less than 10 minutes you can tell they put a lot of effort into this game. For me to just run around at the beginning and try random stuff thinking to myself ""I wonder if I can do this?"" and to find out that I actually can just blows my mind lol... They really thought of everything! My hat goes off to the developers!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
Good game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2021,√âtats-Unis
10/10 I played this once in 2018 when the switch first came out. Wanted to play it so bad again I picked up a new switch and played it in 2019. That good.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"""if you want to play only Zelda for 360$ it is worth that price""Buy a switch and this.  (The only complaint of the game itself, is I wish for way more customizability.  Personally, I would like a camera option that always moves via motion controls, more options for customizing around buttons, and it DESPERATELY needs the ability to DROP weapons [say click the right stick while menuing])",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"My favorite Zelda game since ALttP, it's amazing and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves old school Zelda with true freedom to progress through the game in any way you wish.

"There's a reason this game got best game of the year 2017. I bought a Nintendo Switch just to play this place and haven't bought another game for the console yet! Having this to play portably is incredible. Seriously, if you own a switch, and don't own this game, you need to reconsider your priorities in life",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,5,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Really good Zelda game, maybe the best in years. Plays like a puzzle-y version of Skyrim. Really big world to explore, go most anywhere at the start (some areas are more difficult). Lot's of secrets to find, and puzzles to solve. Very few actual dungeons but still really good as a huge romp across a wild fantasy world.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"While very different from previous Zelda games, and borrowing from other open world games (who borrowed from Zelda), this feels like an instant classic. The graphics ste great while not trying to be perfectly realistic. The gameplay is engaging. The old Zelda complaint of forced progression (labyrinths in a certain order) is solved by giving you the keys to the puzzles early. I'm looking forward to seeing the plot unfold.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

No lo s√©, lo que si s√® es que lo  he disfrutado como ning√∫n juego que haya jugado antes, es un deleite solo caminar, escalar, cazar y escuchar la naturaleza, aspectos secundarios pero que te hacen disfrutar todo de el juego, las mec√°nicas que cambiaron se sienten organicas y amigables, aunque este Zelda sea el m√°s diferente a todos tambi√©n tiene elementos de ellos que te hacen recordar a cada uno, para m√≠ si es una obra maestra que todo mundo deber√≠a de jugar ya sea en switch o en Wii u, no s√© si sea el mejor Zelda de todos pero si s√© que es diferente y qu√© est√° marcando un nuevo rumbo ala saga, para m√≠ un rumbo mejor .",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,Mexique
Great game worth the buy. So many side quests to do on top of the main story line.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Every good thing you have heard about this game is absolutely true. The sense of adventure and freedom that it fosters is incomparable in video games. You are rewarded for curiosity and creativity while being challenged from start to finish, and it is absolutely beautiful to boot.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2019,√âtats-Unis
"You don't need me to tell you this is an amazing game. It's won more than enough awards to need that.I finally bought this game after my friend got tired of me bumming his own copy of it. If you own a Switch, this is a must have, no questions asked.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2018,√âtats-Unis

"This game is very detailed. Everything about the animations and graphics have gone well above and beyond my expectations. Game play is intuitive. This Legend of Zelda game is one of a kind. With a large map, and no linear rules you can truly create your own adventure. Would recommend to new and current fans of the Zelda franchise.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I unboxed this game and started playing it, almost everyone in my family wants to give it a try.  This is what a Zelda game needed.  I would like to see Nintendo do this in the future with more Dungeons and more miniboss choices rather than the three same",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
This game surpassed my expectations,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
This game has took over my social life. It‚Äôs so amazing and I‚Äôve had It about a week now and not half way through yet. Love It. Money well spent.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
"El mejor Zelda que he jugado. Simplemente imperdible. No tiene sentido tener el switch sin este juego. Excelente historia, modo de juego, todo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,7,2021,Mexique
"After 100% completing the base game and it‚Äôs dlc, I have to the conclusion thy this game is one of the greatest games of all time. If you have to buy one game for your Nintendo switch as I write this in 2019 it is this one!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2019,√âtats-Unis
"But far from the hyperbolic praise its been getting. So far ive put in 10 hours and ive had fun with it but i cant help but say ""where is the perfect game ppl have been claiming?"" Has some fps issues on the technical side and graphics are ok. Yes its a decent open world but not this magical one ive been hearing about. I happened to pick Horizon up a few days ago and although ive enjoyed Zelda i enjoyed Horizons 10 first hours more.If you have a Switch yes definitely get Zelda but dont be caught out by blind fanboy priase.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Reminds me of the original Zelda game on the NES, no hand holding, I'm loving it!Is it perfect, no, is it fun, yes!, the only thing that sometimes annoys me is the controls, sometimes I'm trying to run, but Link will crouch, not sure what I'm doing wrong or my hands are too big for the Joycons",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Respecto al env√≠o todo perfecto, en tiempo y en forma a pesar de no haber sido por paqueteria como DHL/estafeta o Fedex, ten√≠a mis dudas, pero llego en perfectas condiciones.Respecto al juego , a pesar de haber salido en Wii U, es un juego excelente con mucho contenido y demasiadas horas de juegos,  vale la pena comprarlo y pasar el rato.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,4,2020,Mexique
"I don't know how they put so much detail and depth into a game designed for a handheld system.  For what it is, the graphics and scenes are great.  I can't stop playing it.  The last Zelda game I played was Ocarina of Time for N64 as a child.  I have put a few dozen hours into the game so far.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,6,2017,√âtats-Unis

"It's visual style is great, and the story so far fantastic.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"The open world is beautiful phenomenal, but with a world that could be fully explored in around 90 hours while resorting to online guides sometimes, I'm bummed out that there weren't that much incentive to hunt monsters because the sword and bow durability system is just so backwards. Also there aren't that much monster diversity or challenge to them either other than the few bosses here and there. It's a great game but not as challenging as the previous Zelda games. I think it deserves a slightly above average score but it could be rounded down to 3 stars especially if you have high expectations.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I love this game, it‚Äôs pretty much all I‚Äôve been playing for the past month and sometimes I can hear my PS4 cry LOL. It‚Äôs nice when you have a lot of free time cuz this game is huge and very laboring, but I love open world games so this is perfect for me. I highly recommend it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This is what Zelda is supposed to be like!  I have enjoyed my experiences so far.  I think I have died more in the first couple of days playing than I have in any Zelda in the past.  Don't rush into this one, enjoy the experience!  Every time I boot my Switch into this experience, I look forward to playing this work of art.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Might be my favorite Zelda game ever now, which is saying a lot.  Others have said it better, but this is definitely very different from all previous Zelda games while still feeling familiar.

"If you like to explore and brainteasers this a game for you, probably the best Zelda game I have play so far since Ocarina of time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
Breath of The Wild is Breath taking! (Sorry) This game is amazing. A large open world with so much to do and collect. It brings plenty of challenge while staying really fun to play. All the while every bit of this awesome experience can be done anywhere you are. It provides an experience you want to play on your TV and continue playing during breaks at work or traveling.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Un gran juego, que corre de maravilla en la consola h√≠brida, la historia de hyrule en Un mundo abierto que tiene vida y respira tranquilidad, entretenimiento sin sentirlo a la par de una historia moderada pero bien llevada, un juego fant√°stico donde puedes hacer cualquier objetivo de 1 y 1000 formas.Estilo de arte contemplativo total, un mundo que genera paz y a la vez te insita aexplorar, cocinar y pelear.Un juego que lo pongo a la par de aquel Ocarina del tiempo, que fue el juego perfecto por muchos a√±os.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,11,2018,Mexique
wonderful game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"200 hours in and one of the best games I've ever played.  I played this right after finishing Final Fantasy 15, and was more impressed by Zelda's visuals thanks to Nintendo's attention to detail (eg. individual blades of grass moving in the wind in Zelda vs clumps of grass slightly distorting in the wind in FFXV) and masterful execution of light and texture.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
Great game!  Highly recommend it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2021,√âtats-Unis

"This game gives Ocarina of Time a serious run for its money.Breath of the Wild is ranked as the second best reviewed game of all time behind only Ocarina of Time, another Legend of Zelda game.

Really like it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
As a lifelong Zelda fan this was absolutely epic. Definitely the best game on the Switch. I didn‚Äôt have a life from March through August because I was obsessed with playing this game! Consistent and intuitive throughout. Nintendo put 110% effort into this and it shows. Spectacular.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,12,2018,√âtats-Unis
"It's zelda, it's open world. It's why I bought a switch and why I was not disappointed buying a switch (mild lie, switch is my second maybe third fav console ever now).But really great game transferring Zelda's feel into 3D open world without making it just feel like Skyrim Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"It's a Zelda game. But its more like the original Zelda than Ocarina of Time. There is little to no instruction, besides a small tutorial area, and even your goal besides ""Defeat Ganon"" is left completely up to you. You're just dropped into a huge world and left to your own devices on how to advance.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I bought some games for my ns, and I play many kinds of game, this one is the best. I don't really like write review, unless the stuff makes me feel incredible, and this one did it.

"I don't even feel I need to say anything more about this game then. GET IT! I have been a fan of the LoZ series my entire like, sense I was 4 years old, and all I can say is get it.

"My husband said it‚Äôs the best game, ever!  So much so that he bought a big TV to play it on because of the graphics.  It‚Äôs awesome and worth every penny apparently.

I absolutely loved it and think if you have an opportunity then you should play this game, it is worth it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This game is amazing in so many ways--Too many accolades to list. People criticize that there isn't much to do but exploring the world in this game is an adventure itself. In my opinion, this game is up there with Ocarina of Time and Link to the Past. Both are highly regarded as some of the greatest video games ever made.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,8,2017,√âtats-Unis
One of the most entertaining games I've gotten in a while. I've played for at least a few hours almost every day since it came out and I STILL haven't beaten Calamity Ganon (though I also pride myself in being a completionist and finding every single hidden shrine/area/treasure). I also feel that this game offers a different take on dungeons that is refreshing and satisfying.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Hands down this is the best Legend of Zelda game I've ever played. Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask were great, but every aspect about Breath of the Wild was amazing. I couldn't stop playing. It literally took me a month to break me daily playing times. I hope in the future that other Zelda games will be this good. It is well worth $60!!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

Great game.  My daughter loves it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
This is the best Zelda since OoT hands down. A breath of fresh air for the series and really brings it into the modern era of games. Despite it's size its very easy to play in small chunks due to the shrine/quest structure the game has. Beautiful environments and music. Nearly every time I play I discover something new that I didn't know I could do before.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

This is the game I thought I imagined I was playing when I was a kid playing A Link to the Past so long ago.  This made me feel like a kid again.  If you're reading this:  Just buy it already.  You won't regret it if you like ANY kind of RPG.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,1,2018,√âtats-Unis

Cheaper than most stores!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Awesome game and it's nice to see Zelda make a big return like this. It's an open world environment but I will say you will want to rage quit at first. It is not as easy as before and you have to use actual tactics to defeat enemies. Once you progress through the game a ways, it gets easier. Definitely worth buying.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If you are debating whether or not to get this, don't- just buy it. Its the most beautiful and interesting game Nintendo has ever produced. This is not your old school 8 bit Link- this is more along the lines of Link in Skyrim. With lots of challenges, it provides a long play time. Get it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

"This is one of my favorite Zelda games now after I have played it for hours on end. It does have a few quirks that can get a little annoying (like the durability of weapons feeling extremely low and it raining far too much), but the sheer beauty of it and joy you get while playing make up for it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,8,2017,√âtats-Unis

"BoTW is a good game, but has too many artificial limitations that hold it back from being truly great. The stamina system, unpredictable rain and most importantly the breaking weapons make a game feel like a chore too often. For an equivalent game that truly feels fun to play and explore, buy Immortals Fenyx Rising instead.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2021,Inde

"If you have a Switch, you NEED this game. I have no words for how amazing and fun it is, how much time there is, and the attention to detail and hidden secrets will bloe your mind.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
Love it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Es un juego muy bien hecho, si vas directo por la campa√±a puedes terminarlo en un tiempo normal, pero tiene una cantidad enorme de lugares por explorar. Es muy amplio, lleno de minijuegos y acertijos que en ning√∫n momento te llegan a frustrar, pero tampoco son a nivel infantil. Se le puede sacar mucho provecho a los amiibos en √©ste juego. Es curioso el efecto que produce, como en la vida real, de ver a la distancia lugares que parecen no estar tan lejos, pero al momento de intentar llegar te das cuenta que si lo est√°n. Las texturas no son tan detalladas como esperaba en algunas partes, pero puede pasar. Los enemigos son el mayor factor que controla tu capacidad de explorar, puedes entrar en un √°rea en la que de un golpe mueres.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,6,2017,Mexique
"Best Switch game i ever owned, so sad i finished it. The first time i started i look out over the massive game world and was like i am so excited to see the whole zelda world.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,6,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I've not played much of it but seems preety generic open world, i like the vast world with great animation's but other quests are preety unlikable, maybe im coming from the likes of skyrim and witcher but i didn't find zelda world anywhere good as mention games, weapons system is bad. I just stop playing after 2 days maybe I'll try another time but didn't like much",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Never played a Zelda game before, but definitely liking this one. Great world, presentation and game mechanics. Sometimes fight the camera and controls but not too bad.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
This is the best game Nintendo has ever made. Oh my gosh did they get this one right. The level of freedom and exploration is unlike anything I've ever experienced in a video game. I've already played through it twice (225 hours) and it probably won't be the last time. The DLC is incredible too. 10/10 hands down.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is the first open world Zelda game that you can play on Nintendo switch. Can‚Äôt wait for the 2nd one to come out.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
My favorite game has always been Skyrim. Now this is my favorite game. Is there really anything else to say?,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,5,2020,√âtats-Unis
She loves it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
Amazing game! Don't rush through the game because you would not enjoy it as much. Don't spoil anything and just get lost and you'll find yourself immersed in everything the game has to offer. The storyline could do some work though (strange for a Zelda game) but its a step in the right direction in every other aspect,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
This game is like fallout for the switch. I spend more time on all the side stuff than I do the main story and there's nothing wrong with that.Don't worry that's the only comparison to fallout I have as this game runs great. Some frame rate issues but the game hasn't crashed or anything and it saves all the time.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Genuinely one of the best switch games I have ever played, I would highly recommend even if you aren‚Äôt an OG Zelda fan!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"I am still chipping away at this amazing game after 2 months. I love this game and so does my son(7). Lots of reading, but I don't mind. Just wish my left analog stick worked.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Great game, but the sounds can be annoying at times, and there's no way to tweak the audio options at all, which is disappointing.Otherwise, 5/5Update: Game is fantastic. So much so that I can't even dock it a point for the annoying footsteps. It's really that good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Idk if it was pre-owned or brand new but it certainly looks new. It came in a perfect sealed case, works fine, and was significantly cheaper than most new/used copies.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
Oh god. This Game. By far one of the best Zelda games to date. The only other Zelda game that beats this would be would Ocarina of time and maybe wind waker. So far this is the best game this year without a doubt on console. Regardless of the other two console systems. For nintendo this was one of their biggest selling games,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
What isn't there to like about this game. It is Nintendo's largest addition to the Zelda franchise and has hours of game play potential. Nintendo really hit it out of the park with this one.Nintendo did fix the most of stability issues with it so no need to worry about that when deciding if you want the game or not.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
Although the Ocarina of Time will forever be my favourite it is fun to play. I‚Äôve gotten multiple people addicted.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,4,2020,√âtats-Unis
All as expected.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Es el primer zelda que juego nunca me habia llamado la atencion el juego, pero decidi darle una oportunidad por las muy buenas rese√±as que tiene.Este zelda es un juego de mundo abierto, con puzzles interesantes y entretenidos, tiene mini- juegos in game bastante buenos y la mecanica de combate fluida, una historia que te atrapa y misiones secundarias muy buenas. No hay lugar del juego al que no puedas acceder lo cual lo hace impresionante.La entrega como es ya una costumbre en amazon en tiempo y forma.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,1,2019,Mexique
"I've played nearly every Zelda game at this point.  Sometimes, I go back to them, and play them again... but nostalgia is overtaken by reality, and none of them feel like the romanticized version of what a ""Zelda"" game is to me.This is the first Zelda game I've played where I feel like I'm actually living in the universe... Amazing.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
A great Zelda game but not the greatest. Still warrants a 5 star rating though. I got at least 100 hours out of it. This game is addicting and you will lose sleep and some of your social life. But who needs friends anyway when you have Link and the Switch.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Great game. So much thing to do and if you are one of those who just ignore the main mision and want something else to do, there is plenty in here.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
"The best Zelda ever.  I'm usually very critical about games, especially console games, but this one was a home run.  The controls are great and not gimmicky.  The graphics are gorgeous for a Nintendo game as well as for a portable game system.  Nintendo finally figured out how to put their weird controller ideas to good use.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
I love this game so much I completed it in 2 days.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,8,2020,Canada
If you have a switch and you don't have this game... You're missing the entire point of owning a switch. It was just as good on the Wii-U but this game is a must have.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,7,2019,√âtats-Unis
"I've never been a Zelda fan...until now. This game is excellent, very detailed, loads to do on a huge map, it's also very beautiful it feels like a classic animated movie , think Ponyo or Totoro .my wife is playing while I write this and is currently surfing across the desert being dragged by a walruss , what's not to love!!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
Fantastic game. I have put many hours into exploring this beautiful game. Not much to say that isn't already said about this game. Get it! But don't expect an engaging story. Quite a weak story if I'm honest. But the gameplay and the amount of things you can do in this game.. that's what makes this game so amazing.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"As far as Zelda games go, this one's pretty different. Having said that, I've put more hours into this than any other Switch game yet and I'm still learning new things about it. Great fun, highly recommend getting the DLC as well.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,1,2019,√âtats-Unis
This game is amazing. It is so long and there's so much to do! Tons of side quests and the main quest is very well structures. It's one of the most interactive games I have ever played.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,6,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent game.  It didn‚Äôt follow the standard Zelda format, but it was familiar enough, and offered enough nostalgia that I appreciated the change of pace.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
Fun game. So vast and complex.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
Awesome game!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2021,Canada
"Lleg√≥ en perfectas condiciones y es un juego muy recomendable, horas y horas de diversi√≥n y entretenimiento asegurado. Si a√∫n no tienes este titulo en tu Nintendo Switch no se que est√°s esperando para adquirirlo. Aunque no seas fan de la saga The Leyend of Zelda el juego es excelente y no te arrepentir√°s de comprarlo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,6,2020,Mexique
The map is huge and the graphic is nice.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"De los mejores si no el mejor juego para switch. Definitivamente debes tenerlo en tu lista de juegos. Casi un ""mundo abierto"" por lo que puedes seguir jugando horas aun habiendo completado la historia.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2021,Mexique
Arrived in the original packaging. Really fun game. Highly suggested.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,10,2020,√âtats-Unis

"I do not have a Switch yet, but my hardcore Nintendo fan of a friend has one and I can tell you based off of him that it's a wicked awesome game.When it came out, he pored hours into this and often admires the land and searching around. You will have fun with this even besides going for the bosses.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Love this game so much ! Came with 1 day shipping and no damage on arrival. 10/10 game would recommend to anyone looking at it for the holiday season !,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,10,2019,√âtats-Unis
Really fun game. Got it for my nephew for Christmas and he played it for hours. I tried it as well and found it very entertaining.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"BEST ZELDA GAME PERIOD. Yes doesn't have the dungeons like previously Zelda games but the amount of mini dungeons made it awesome. If you like to search, explore and craft, this is the game. Weapons break a lot Yes but there are tons and tons of weapons out there.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Una nueva experiencia en cuesti√≥n de juegos de Zelda, al principio lo sent√≠ algo pesado pero el mapa es hermoso, la m√∫sica sensacional y obvio super entretenido, 100% recomendado",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,5,2021,Mexique
"May be the best game I've ever played. Prepare to sink hours of your life into open world exploration, puzzles, and a heart wrenching story. This game is worth buying the console for!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
"It‚Äôs a free roaming realm. My husband loves that he can do whatever he wants without restrictions. Climb a tree, jump a cliff,and if he‚Äôs bored he can use all 459 of my Animal Crossing Amiibo cards every single day to get food üòÇ",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,9,2018,√âtats-Unis
It's flat out a fun and challenging game! Open world (a bit to open) and some serious exploration. Gotta be smart with weapons use and meals.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
Another great Zelda game. I think this one has the best graphics so far. Easy to play on the Switch and lots of exploring to do.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
Cool cool cool üòé thank you,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
You can see the detail and time the developers put into this game.  I don't want to give anything away but trust me.  This will go down as one of the best zelda games of all time.  You will get well over a hundred of hours out of it with lots of challenge.  Hurry up and get it!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This game is amazingly fun.  Gameplay is superb, and offers a well developed world with very few situations where the controls feel sub-optimal.  The graphics may not have as many details as a modern PC game, the illusion is never broken.  This is a game for the record books.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
One of the best Zelda games ever. I have played both the Switch and Wii U versions of this game and the Switch is by far the best gameplay.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Wonderful game.  This is one of the best stories I've seen in a Zelda game.  The world is huge, and there is so much to explore.  The best part was interacting with all the different races, the Zora being one of my favorite.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
Bought on a whim LOVE this game quickly became a favorite,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
My 11-year old son loves this game. I watched him play and was so impressed with the graphics. The storyline is amazing and I love the amount of problem-solving that is required to advance in the game. I'll admit it -- this 40-something Mom tried it and now I am hooked!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"This is a great addition to the Zelda franchise!  THe concept is do what you want, go wherever you want, and solve puzzles in multiple ways.You've likely read a great deal about this game before you got to my review, so just take this as a recommendation if you want an open-world Zelda game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I don't actually like this game very much. People have compared to Skyrim, so I had that mindframe when first playing and it isn't comparable.  If I didnt have Skyrim as a forethought I would have liked the game more, but it would never have been a favorite of mine.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Great game, lots of content. Bought it to catch up before the breath of the wild 2. Nice easter eggs to all the older Zelda games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
The GAME that makes switch success,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Casi seis a√±os de desarrollo finalmente culminaron en esto. En un juego que en conjunto con su sofisticado motor de f√≠sicas nos prove√© de un mundo abierto que puede ser explorado e interactuado de maneras inimaginables, un mundo el cual te incita a resolverlo no necesariamente de la manera en que se supone que deber√≠as hacerlo. Esta es la evoluci√≥n de Zelda m√°s grande y que francamente ser√° dif√≠cil superar en el futuro, tanto para el propio Nintendo como para la industria en general.Como ya lo comentaron muchas personas, el juego sufre en su rendimiento, cayendo el framerate en pueblos principalmente o zonas con mucha hierba, afortunadamente el mundo tan interesante y mecanicas tan libres que presenta el juego, eclipsan sin problema estos pocos problemas.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,Mexique
My husband is obsessed with this game. He used to play it when he was younger and he loves playing it now. Definitely worth the buy!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
Extraordinary game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
I know I'm going to be playing this game for a while. Many others have probably written a lot of good things about this. But here's my 2 cents. It's awesome!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,8,2019,√âtats-Unis
Love this game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,2,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Best game ever made IMO. I  got started playing the very first Zelda game back In the day and this game just tops all others in the series. Almost unlimited game play. Explore, puzzles, bosses, what more could you ask for.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,11,2018,√âtats-Unis
I ought a second copy of this game for my friends it's such a fun way to spend time. There is so much to do in this open world game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,9,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Un zelda hecho y derecho. Un juego hermoso e incre√≠ble en todos los aspectos. Es un juego que rompe con muchas de las convenciones de los Zeldas anteriores (como la estructura lineal del juego, los calabozos enormes, las piezas de corazon, etc.). Sin embargo, el gameplay es excelente. La historia es abierta, y puedes irla resolviendo en el orden que quieras, lo cual hace la opci√≥n de mundo abierto algo esencial. La exploracion es la clave. Otro gran factor es que las armas tienen puntos de resistencia (algo tipo como en Fire Emblem) lo cual hace que quieras usarlas de manera m√°s cuidadosa. Lo recomiendo much√≠simo, si tienes un switch, no lo dudes un segundo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2017,Mexique
"this is the game you buy for the nintendo switch, its an excellent adventure with deep story and tons of side quests. the world is very large and you can spend hours exploring it.

"Anyone who has given this game less than 5 stars clearly isn't playing Breath of the Wild.  The game is astounding and well deserving of it's 4th highest overall rating on MetaCritic. Completely open-world, go anywhere you see, tough as nails, and an epic journey.  Well worth your money and every Switch owner needs to own this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Loved the graphics. You had to get used to the controls. My son had a lot of fun watching me get killed. Lol,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2020,√âtats-Unis

Another great Zelda VERY DIFFERENT BUT GOOD,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent game! Open world keeps it fun, the ability to interact in meaningful ways with pretty much everything allows multiple ways to solve any puzzle (e.g. Link can paraglide off of a mountain onto the back of his horse and begin a fight). 5/7 perfect.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"if you like any other Zelda game you will love this one, if you hate every other Zelda game you'll love this one anyways. its super fun, beautiful scenery and great playability will keep you coming back for more. switch or wii u do your self a favor and buy this game you will not be sorry you did.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

This came in the mail so fast. It's a highly rated title and it looks gorgeous. The artwork alone is phenomenal.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Al fin pude probar este t√≠tulo y puedo decir que las melod√≠as en piano solo quedaron a deber pues son los tonos cuando descubres algo, de modo que quitan un poco lo apremiante que es el avance. Las gr√°ficas cumplen y ya y la historia va bien hasta el momento. Lo que si, !al fin un Zelda en Japon√©s con subt√≠tulos al espa√±ol latino!!!, El idioma se puede cambiar dentro del juego y hay muchas opciones. Esperen las ofertas, puedes ahorrar hasta $600 en comparaci√≥n a la eShop, adem√°s que en f√≠sico no hay que instalar nada y ahorras en espacio tambi√©n!.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,2,2019,Mexique

I'm glad to be back in the Skyrim days with this wonderful open world RPG. This game has got to be one of the best I've played in years and recommend to anyone that wants to go on an adventure that feels rather close to reading a great book!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"El juego llego en prefectas condiciones y con un buen embalaje y sin maltratos, el √∫nico problema fue que tardo 2 d√≠as m√°s de lo que se supone que debi√≥ haber tardado, lo cual me preocupo, pero de all√≠ en fuera todo perfecto.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,11,2020,Mexique

"Absolutely amazing!!! I've played almost every Zelda game ever made, (Not that weird cartoon Link one and not Phantom hourglass) And this is the raddest thing I have ever laid hands/eyes on from Nintendo. And it's savagely brutal....which is also rad. I've never died so many times in any Zelda game ever.....which will only make me stronger....",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
It is a great game I went in a skeptic about this game and now I cant put it down great game!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
I could spend all day with it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
It‚Äôs Zelda with a 3D look. No more blowing on cartridges for this unique version of the game I played when I was a child. It‚Äôs interesting to see how far technology has come.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,4,2019,√âtats-Unis
The hype surrounding this game is real and well-deserved.  It gets better and better the more you play it.  The depth of this game is unreal.  The fighting mechanics are incredible and really reward those who practice.  Nintendo makes the best games.  A masterpiece.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"There are tons of reviews out there for this game, so I won‚Äôt get into the details. I enjoy it, my wife enjoys it, my 14 year old and my 5 year old enjoy it.If you have a Switch(or a Wii U) you should be buying this.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,1,2018,√âtats-Unis

"This game is incredibly addicting. I don't know why it's so good, but it is SO GOOD. I usually dislike exploratory open-world games but something about this one hits the nail right on the head. I can understand why this received so many game of the year awards.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
this game has ruined my work ethic and my dogs have formed their own lord-of-the-flies style society in the absence of my previously endless structure... where did they even find a conch shell??.... looked at myself 2 weeks after release to find out i grew a beard like castaway style.... am 31 year old woman.... totally worth it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"My husband has been playing this for hours at a time and cannot stop raving about the quality of the game. I don't play, but based on what he keeps saying it's intuitive, the land is huge (much bigger than the original) and he is always talking about spirit orbs!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I didn't realize you needed a different profile for two people to have seperate save files, so I let my dad play and he saved over my save. It would have been kinda nice to know that, and now I have to start over again. C'est la vie.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2018,√âtats-Unis

Christmas gift,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,1,2021,Canada
"Excelente, y el precio en el que lo encontr√© al momento de mi compra fue magnificoSiempre he amado los juegos de The Legend Of Zelda y hasta el momento Twilight Princess era mi favorito, pero acabo de terminar esta JOYA y no puedo creer lo sublime que es esta obra de arte, vale cada peso y de hecho hasta siento que le debemos a Nintendo por semejante pieza.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,11,2019,Mexique
Arrived as expected,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Going against the crowd here-this game doesn't grip me or pull me in. I like Ocarina or even Majora better. Open game design is all the rage, but I guess I'm one of the few that gets bored spending valuable game time walking around in a virtual reality for hours with not much else going on. Gets old.  Of course, no one will listen to this. I guess other people (kids and riffraff) have tons of spare time to waste just wondering around aimlessly ""waiting"" for something to happen.Bleh",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Not only one of the best gaming experiences, but hands down the best Legend of Zelda game ever. Breath of the Wild evokes the exploration that Shigeru Miyamoto originally envisioned when he first created the Legend of Zelda series on NES. Never before has Zelda felt so immersive, so brilliant, so beautiful. Truly a contemporary masterpiece and instant classic.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I'm about 20 hours in....this game is worth its price and I dare say it's worth the price of getting a Switch just for this game.  The world is huge, the gameplay is varied, and the level of detail is deep.  I've played skyrim, oblivion, fallout, previous zeldas, witcher and in terms of open world gameplay.....this wins",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

Ya estoy esperando la segunda parte de esta entrega.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,6,2020,Mexique
We ordered this before we were even able to find a Switch. The Switch is basically a Zelda machine for me.This.Game.Is.Amazing.I highly recommend also getting the additional DLC. Lots of fun extras.

I definitely recommend.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2018,√âtats-Unis
"If you have a Switch, this is definitely worth getting. Takes quite a while to beat if you want to do everything in the game, or you can beat it quickly if that's your thing. The upcoming DLC that will be added later is completely additional, and not at all needed to complete or enjoy this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

Very captivating and amazing game. You get so caught up in it that hours will pass by and you're still playing. I had to stop myself from playing so I could actually clean my house and do school work.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,11,2018,√âtats-Unis
I LOVE this game. I've always been a huge Zelda fan but this game goes way beyond my expectations. Been playing it almost a month now. Doing side quests and puzzles and building my hearts. There is a long adventure awaiting if you choose to make it last !!!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,12,2017,√âtats-Unis

I could go on for paragraphs on how amazing this game is. I'd never played a Zelda game before this one so don't let that stop you from playing this one. It really is as good as everyone is saying. Go play this.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,6,2018,√âtats-Unis

"It has been a very long time since I have played Zelda(on the original nes and 64) and this game does not disappoint,  I only wish that I could have got the special edition with the sword and case but due to scalpers and bogus ads on amazon/ebay i dont think ill get them",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent game. This was meant to be an open world. My only gripe is that some of the monster designs felt a little lazy and repetitive, and I wish they brought back the dungeon style from previous Legend of Zelda installments. Despite that, definitely very good game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2018,√âtats-Unis
"The game itself is fun, and would totally recommend to a friend. But weirdly enough when the package arrived at my door, it looked as if it was sliced open at one end. The game was still inside and still sealed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Massive game, incredible achievement in the open world design of games. A fully interactive open world where you're given the right tools (gliders, horses, more) to fully explore. A game that advances as you choose it, puzzles that can be solved potentially a number of ways.Stunning and engrossing environment, truly a work of art.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Haven't finished it yet but so far it's one of the greatest games ever, let alone Zelda game. The feel of the open world brings me back to the original Legend Zelda. My kids and I play this together and enjoy every minute of exploration and adventure.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Possibly game of the year. The imperfections throughout the game are easily overshadowed by what seems like the complete redefintion of ""open world"" games should be. Easily 200+ hours of gameplay to 100% the game; 60-70% to ""feel done"" but you could speed run the game in pretty short order if you had guts of steel.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Excellent game, bought a new Switch after playing it, beating it and selling everything. I repeat, I bought a console over again just to play this and having more fun with it the second time.

"Very fun for a while. Gets a little too same-y before even beating it though. The overworld is great, and the game rewards you enough for exploring every little nook and cranny of it.-slight SPOILERS-A large part of the core of a Zelda game is themed dungeons, and unique, iconic bosses and items. This game is really lacking all of those things. If they make another open world game that also includes all of those things it would be magical.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,7,2018,√âtats-Unis

"This is David's girlfriend. I am so happy he bought this game before we moved in together. He was thoroughly pleased with it and played it to completion during his down time. Recently he even picked up his switch again for the dlc, which would not get a 5 star, might I add.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,7,2017,√âtats-Unis
It's amazing. Very hard to put down. Lots to do. The weapon durability might turn some ppl off but know this. Pretty soon into the game you'll be tripping over weapons they're everywhere . & it's all about management . There's something here for everyone.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
Playing this game makes me feel like I am playing a true 3D version of A Link to the Past (which is still my favorite Zelda game). If you bought a switch or are thinking about it still. This game is truly a system seller.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2018,√âtats-Unis

Well done, Nintendo!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
I grew up on Zelda and I can honestly say this was a solid addition to the franchise.  Didn't love it though since it's a large departure from the Zelda I grew up playing and it didn't quite captivate me like the more linear entries did.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,5,2018,√âtats-Unis

"Apenas voy empezando el juego, yo creo llevar√© un avance del 5 o 10% y se ve bien, tiene una jugabilidad b√°rbara, puedes destruir medio mundo, hacer y des hacer, eso para m√≠ tiene un punto malo porque pierdes mucho tiempo ‚Äúperdiendo el tiempo‚Äù en cosas que no ayudan en nada. Pero creo que lo mejor aun falta. Debes jugarlo en una buena pantalla para que valores la calidad de las animaciones",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,9,2019,Mexique
"Worst zelda game ive ever player easily. EASILY.It‚Äôs huge and pretty and has a lot of innovative stuff never seen in a zelda, but almost every single thing they added is a misfire.  First, it‚Äôs barren...it‚Äôs a giant huge amazing world with NOTHING IN IT.  No, i dont count boring little pig monsters or re-skins of boring little pig monsters, or endless crafting things that don‚Äôt make anything remotely cool, or another melee weapon that breaks after 3 swings.  These are not content.  Second, it‚Äôs repetitive.  They got rid of big themed dungeons...I‚Äôm honestly not sure why but Im not against it if they did something cool. They did not.  They made a bunch, maybe hundreds, of small dungeons that feel incredibly joyless and give you nothing cool.There‚Äôs just nothing to build to, nothing story wise (the whole story is told through flashbacks)Cannot believe people are pretending this is a good game.  In 5 years no one will be talking about it.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,10,2019,√âtats-Unis

"I bought a Switch with Zelda twice trying to give the game a fair chance. After playing it a second time, I still didn't do anything for me. BOTW changes the Zelda formula too much for my taste. I don't like the amount of traveling you have to do and how empty the world is. I don't like the shrines. I don't like the breakable weapons. I don't like the lack of music. I don't like the climbing/stamina mechanic. I could go on, but to keep it short, it's just not for me.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,10,2020,√âtats-Unis

Problem the best game of this year. This game has set a new bench mark in games. It is suitable for kids and adults. As in all Zelda games it is above and beyond all these blood and guts games that are out. Just good clean fun for the whole family.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,6,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Simply put, this may very well be the best game Nintendo has ever made. The freedom to do whatever you want in this enormous world that looks like a painting, the ability to tackle all situations with an infinite numbers of possibilities, the music fully orchestrated and climactic...games simply do not get better than this.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"This game hooks you from start to finish.  If you have a switch, you need to play this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
Amazing game to play! Notice how most reviews are 5 stars and a few one stars where they just complain because they don't think it deserves the reviews it recieved. The people leaving one stars are just like a itchy spouse who is in a nit picky mood because they didn't get there own way,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
more like 4.5 stars.this game can be a bit addictive to the point of where you will not be able to stop playing it even when you know you have something else to do. i am even tempted to skip work to play this game a lot more than i should...,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

Such a fantastic game. The main story is great but I know how much I love it by how wrapped into the side quests I get. Exploring and doing the little things in the game is totally fun. Being able to pick up the Switch and start where I left off is awesome!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If I were stuck on an island and could only take one game, this would be it! Such a beautiful game, great for all ages. Me and my son love it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2019,√âtats-Unis

"The game case is shorter and less wide than a GameCube/Wii case, but it looks good. Does not include a manual, but there are slits on the inside of the case if one should opt to include their own insert. I cannot speak for the game itself as my console has yet to ship.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is the best video game I have ever played. I've put over 80 hours into the game since it came out and I have never done that with any other game. Delivery was miscalculated however and my first copy arrived several days early while I was away and was stolen from my mailbox..,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

I haven't played a Zelda game in forever and I am thoroughly impressed with how much you can do and how massive the world is. This is easily a 120 hour game start to finish. I haven't gotten too far in it but i am extremely satisfied with it so far!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I honestly cannot remember the last time I was this addicted to a video game. Since the release, I have spent all of my free time playing Zelda. As lame as it sounds, I simply can't get enough!

this is the greatest zelda game ive played. even better than ocarina of time. id highly recommend getting this game on wiiU if you already own one then buying a switch and playing it on there but its up to you the game is still one of the best games ive ever played.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
Love this game. There is so many side quest and adventures hidden in the game. The game doesn't feel repetitive. It has lots of puzzles to solve and that is what makes this game different than a lot of modern games. There is more to the game than just killing your enemies.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,5,2017,√âtats-Unis
"There isn't much I could type that hasn't been typed already.  This is one of the best games I've played.  It's well worth the purchase of the Switch just to play this game.  I hope Nintendo can follow it up with other great titles, but it's a good start.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

Muchas misiones alternas, personajes y armas disponibles para este nuevo t√≠tulo.Algo que me sorprendi√≥ es no solo la acci√≥n sino lo divertido que puede hacer cuando te dedicas a explorar el mundo.Sin duda no quiero spoilear tu pr√≥xima aventura, solo te doy como tip que te des tiempo y disfrutes cada minuto de este t√≠tulo que aunque para muchos quiz√°s no es el mejor zelda pero si es el m√°s abierto en posibilidades.Mi recomendaci√≥n es COMPRALO y ded√≠cale tiempo a apreciar el arte que hay en el ambiente",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,8,2017,Mexique

Fun fun fun!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Overall a great game but it doesnt feel like a Zelda title. Its more like skyrim than a traditional zelda. Its an overall beautiful game with good mechanica but its also a bit dull. The weapon durabiltiy in this game is awful, it pretty much ruins the game. Its the open world zelda we always wanted but they decided to move away from what made zelda titles great and therefore this game is a dud.",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,10,2018,√âtats-Unis
must have it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
One of the best games ever made! If you love the Zelda games this one is by far one of the best.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,12,2019,√âtats-Unis
"This is another fantastic Zelda game. Much more in-depth than the previous ones, the world is huge and wide-open and the game doesn't give you too much direction on what to do, and yet somehow it works perfectly anyways. This is probably the only game really worth getting on the switch right now.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If youre here, you probably already know that Breath of the Wild is one of the best games of the past ten years period, so just know that it delivers quickly and safely, and goes on sale often.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,7,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Quite possibly the best game I've ever played!  I was never a huge fan of Zelda, more of a casual fan but this game changes my view.  There's so much to do!  It's very easy to get sidetracked, it's gonna take forever to complete everything in this game.  A+",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Great game, it just pulls you in. So much to do and offers a balance of challenging obstacles that it doesn't feel like the game is throwing impossible task at you and gives you enough feedback that you know what you have to do to accomplish certain task without getting you too frustrated.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"I‚Äôve been playing this game 4 days straight and I have so much left to play. It‚Äôs one of the best games I‚Äôve played, the music makes you feel inside the game. The character evolution feels natural and the gameplay feels wonderful. I recommend it 100%",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,11,2017,√âtats-Unis

"As a long time Zelda fanatic I can definitely say this is hands down the franchise's strongest delivery. Game play, graphics, and most of all, the extensiveness of the game's world. You can spend months doing nothing but exploring. Solid effort all around.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
I have no criticism. The developers of this game thought of anything. And I hope they use this game engine for another Zelda title on the switch. The physics are super cool and the game is incredibly fun if not a little cliche at times.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,11,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Just like everyone else out there, this game is the only reason that I purchased a Switch on launch. This is the open world Zelda adventure that we have all been waiting forever. It's been in development for almost 5 years & it shows. This game is an absolute masterpiece. GAME OF THE YEAR!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
"Ocarina of Time was the best in my book until this came out. More than a hundred hours into the game and only done with two of the beasts. Amazing graphics and game play, love the open world where you can choose your own path. Best one yet!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,7,2017,√âtats-Unis

This Is the best game for the Nintendo Switch so far and probably the best game over all the games this year for any console. This game is well worth it; so far I have over 70 hours in and plan on continuing on playing even after the main storyline is finished.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
It's an open adventure with some puzzle challenge.  Go anywhere in the verse but map only expands when you use certain area features.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
Best game I've ever played and I've played pretty much every top game. There's just too much to say about it; just buy it if you have a switch or Wii u. Even nongamers love it. My friend can't stop playing or talking about it and he just plays Madden every year.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"Lo compre con cierta cautela por la cantidad de revuelo que lo rodeo en los d√≠as anteriores a su salida a la venta, pero es uno de los mejores t√≠tulos que he tenido la oportunidad de disfrutar, la cantidad de contenido en el juego es impresionante si te tomas el tiempo de explorar, la direcci√≥n de arte es sublime, el estilo de caricatura quedo como anillo al dedo y los paisajes te dejaran con la boca abierta, no puedo contar las veces en que simplemente me he quedado parado para admirar un amanecer o un atardecer en este juego. De los pocos puntos malos que vi en el t√≠tulo es que a veces el framerate baja considerablemente sobretodo en la versi√≥n de tv.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,3,2017,Mexique
A must have game for Switch!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,9,2020,√âtats-Unis
This game is probably the best thing I've seen out of Nintendo for a long time. The graphics as well as cartoonish feel contribute well to the landscape and provides many lovable characters. This game definitely deserved to be on the switch with 1080p resolution instead of on the Wii U.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2017,√âtats-Unis
Now on my third play through. Great to just drop into and wack some enemies.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2020,√âtats-Unis

"Yes, this game is different from the old Zelda games, but as a fan of the entire franchise, I welcomed the change! It is a fantastic game, not a perfect game, but it is fairly close. Easy to spend hours on this game and it was worth every single penny!!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
Great game! It was an excellent introduction to the Legend of Zelda franchise. I'll be looking to play more now.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,12,2019,√âtats-Unis

"Esta genial, te lo recomiendo totalmente. Si eres gamer es tu juego. Horas y horas de juego.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2021,Mexique
This game is BEAUTIFUL! The story is solid. The game play is solid. The character development is solid. The only thing I don't like is the weapons break so you have to go and continuously find weapons to use. It isn't the stereotypical Zelda game so go into knowing that.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
The games confusing its like your suppose to know what to do already when you play,3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,10,2021,√âtats-Unis
Incredible game! Loved that they made several nods to past games. Probably my favorite game in the whole franchise.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,1,2020,√âtats-Unis
One of the greatest games I've ever played. I would definitely recommend anyone to play this game. I've always been a big Zelda fan and this is one of the best. It's different than the others and that's what makes it more appealing to me.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,9,2017,√âtats-Unis
"If I could tell myself as a kid this is what I would one day be playing in a Zelda game, I would never believe me.  This game is amazing and I have sunk over a hundred hours into exploring the world alone.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,10,2017,√âtats-Unis
This is the best game I have ever played on my life.  It is amazing I love it.  Months of fun.  Don‚Äôt want to give anything away,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2019,√âtats-Unis
"Very repetitive. Not near enough direction- I love open worlds, but I don't have all the time in the world to try and figure out the right direction I have to go. See a tower in the distance, finally get to it, there's a ton of enemies around it that seem to be a lot stronger than you, so you feel like you might be in the wrong.  Weapons constantly break, the fighting is ridiculous, one hit and you die unless you spend all your time cooking recipes and storing hearts. When I play a story game I ALWAYS finish it before moving on to another game. I stopped gaming for over a month because every time I went to play it felt tedious. I really tried with this game. I even tried reading articles about the gameplay.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2021,√âtats-Unis

This is a game my entire family place we all made separate account just so we can all play this one game. More than worth the $60 price tag wish I could find 10 other games just like it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2018,√âtats-Unis
I'll keep this brief since there are already a lot of reviews up. Mainly I think Nintendo is openly challenging the idea that one game isn't worth a console purchase. I've been playing for nearly 80 hours and I don't doubt I'll put another 40 to 50 in. Incredible game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2017,√âtats-Unis
My son loves this game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,10,2020,√âtats-Unis

La historia no te la cuentan de una manera lineal, tu mismo vas descubriendo todo, lo cual resulta en toda una experiencia. Las f√≠sicas me paraecen impresionantes, muy bien trabajadas, debieron pasar horas y horas programando la f√≠sica del juego, la cual es incre√≠ble. La jugabilidad es muy buena y cada segundo del juego lo aprovechas mucho. Much√≠simas horas de diversi√≥n pas√© con este juego y espero con ans√≠as los DLC para aumentar mi experiencia. No lo dudes, yo compr√© la Nintendo Switch por este juego y vali√≥ cada centavo.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,7,2017,Mexique

"Great open world adventure, tons of hours of gameplay.Unlike any other Zelda game I am familiar with in a good way.The game to have for Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,8,2018,√âtats-Unis
"Huh. I thought this would be better after seeing so many reviews compare it to Dark Souls and Skyrim. No character tree, no dungeons, no ability to repair your favorite weapons, and sub-par voice acting (in the very few instances where there is dialog). While the art style was wonderful to look at, I really can't think of another unique or stand-out characteristic of this game. I wanted to like it. I really did. I played about 8 hours and got too tired of moving (quite slowly) through the world, and I think I'm just going to move on to DOOM or Super Mario Odyssey at this point.Maybe my expectations were way off, but this was not the game I was personally hoping for. Will be sticking to Ocarina of Time playthroughs instead :)",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,1,2018,√âtats-Unis
"I wouldn't say I'm much of a fan of Zelda, but this game was absolutely amazing! I love how you're free to do what you want whenever you want. If you have a Switch this game is a must have.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,5,2017,√âtats-Unis

Vale totalmente la pena, es una chulada y Amazon lo tiene en un s√∫per precio",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2020,Mexique
The reason I gave it a four star is because I can't actually get the console to play it on. So all I have is the cartridge (which I licked) to look at because apparently Nintendo wants to make it as difficult as possible to play.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,4,2017,√âtats-Unis

Segundo, comentando el juego: No duden en conseguirlo y probarlo, es un juego de mundo abierto, que presenta adem√°s muchas variables y condiciones que los otros juegos de Zelda no hab√≠an utilizado, todo esto sin perder la esencia de la historia.

"Zelda is one of my favorite series, yet this entry hit all the wrong notes for me. I did really enjoy the climbing terrain and paragliding over the lands though. Dungeons themselves I did not enjoy, but the shrines were fun though wore out the welcome after a few dozen. Coupled with next to no storytelling and way too much barren lands just grew tired for me. I can see the great mold underneath and with a few tweaks I can see a followup being great. I do like the new direction and attempt at a mix up, but the lack of the puzzle solving I used to enjoy makes it hard to stick with.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2018,√âtats-Unis

Como mencionan todos los comentarios es un juego excelenteEs una sincera recomendaci√≥n.Si adem√°s del juego planeas adquirir Amiibos de Zelda solo les recomendar√≠a lo siguiente:Recomendar√≠a  precauci√≥n con el AMIIBO de Link Smash Bros que otorga entre otras cosas a Epona en este juego.A pesar de que los amiibos otorgan premios una vez al d√≠aA Epona solo se otorga la primera vez que se use por tanto  recomiendo precauci√≥n y que se use despu√©s de que el jugador haya bajado de la gran meseta (meseta de los albores/great plateau) de lo contrario por razones obvias ser√° imposible retenerlo.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2017,Mexique

"El juego es pr√°cticamente perfecto,a mi opinion el mejor Zelda que ha existido, todas las mec√°nicas me parecen excelentes, inclusive el hecho de que las armas se rompan con facilidad (aunque a veces con las armas mas d√©biles cae en lo ridiculo), esto para que no te estanques con una sola arma y conozcas todo el arsenal ademas de que esta mec√°nica te invita a buscar tu arma favorita... si no lo compras estas desperdiciando el potencial del Switch y estas dejando ir la oportunidad de jugar uno de los mejores juegos que se han creado.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,6,2017,Mexique
Really thought link wouldve given zelda the rod.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,11,2019,√âtats-Unis
This game could have been a greatest of all time game! lack of dungeons and dispersing all of that into shrines made the game boring and repetitive. Getting 1-shotted and then endgame being godlike needed to have more balance. not alot of though went into sets and set bonuses and grinds needed to upgrade them all. Boring end boss in Pig Ganon you basicly cant lose against. Patching the bowling game hurt the game as well as money cant really help out threw your quest that much and that was the way you could clear the money hurdle in a few hours,2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2018,√âtats-Unis

"El mundo abierto no limita la profundidad de la historia, logra envolverte en una historia emocionante al tomar el rol del h√©roe Link. Sin embargo, su dificultad puede parecer mayor a la de entregas anteriores por lo que video jugadores que acostumbran sesiones de 60 minutos solo se frustraran y pensaran en dejarlo debido a lo extenso del mundo y necesidad de perfeccionar habilidades para la batalla. Una vez que superas la barrera inicial de dificultad e inmensidad del mundo abierto es cuando te ves recompensado con la mejor experiencia que peude ofrecer un Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,3,2017,Mexique

"Un excelente juego para nintendo switch, lleg√≥ intacto y funciona a la perfecci√≥n",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,12,2020,Mexique
Un juego muy bello y completo. Este juego cambia la tradici√≥n lineal en los t√≠tulos de Zelda y permite al usuario libre movimiento en toda la experiencia de juego. Resultar√° abrumador el tama√±o del mundo a explorar y la cantidad de misiones y calabozos a descifrar. Los controles tambi√©n representan un reto por su variedad. Elementos como la incorporaci√≥n de cortos animados y voces de los personajes le han dado mucha fuerza a la historia principal. Un gran acierto para dar entrada a la nueva consola de Nintendo.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,Mexique

"I'm a huge zelda game series. But, this game strayed very far from the others. While I appreciate the open world concept, it is almost too big. It seems like it is big for the sake of being big. There isn't any real reward. Side quests are just the generic fetching quests. Weapons break, and the whole thing with the stamina gets boring pretty quick. This definitely did not grab my attention like other zelda games did. If I wanted to play an open world game, I'd rather play Witcher 3.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2017,√âtats-Unis

"I have played every single Zelda game and I'm a big fan of the series. Even though the art is quite beautiful, and the overworld is huge.The game has serious issues for a Zelda game, as a matter of fact it is the worst Zelda game ever.It lacks, history, the characters in this entry do not represent their legacy.The Zelda character is bratty, insolent, foolish capricious, basically the whole opposite of what Zelda has always represented.Link, the ""champion"" is not well prepared and weak.Because their terrible skills and aptitudes hyrules fell under a terrible fate.There are no real dungeons.The 4 main dungeons can be passed in less than half hour because it does no have a challenge, not puzzles which is something that characterize any LoZ game.They try to compensate by putting 120 shrines. Those are quite fun to find, because you can explore the whole world, but inside of the shrines it gets very repetitive and without a real difference. It seems like they preferred quantity over quality.The master sword looses its power after a few minutes and you need to wait, use another weapon, the game it is filled with them, but most are borring and fragile.The dlcs are ok, but nothing relevant imho.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2017,Mexique

"Incontournable, tout simplement",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,9,2022,France
"C'est pour moi l'un de mes premiers jeux de la licence Zelda et mon premier jeu sur Switch et je ne suis absolument pas d√©√ßu. Les graphismes sont magnifiques, bien que le style peut ne pas correspondre √† tout le monde, il n'en reste pas moins beau visuellement. Le jeu est tr√®s complet, pour les adeptes des jeux compl√©t√©s √† 100%, il y a clairement du contenu. Qu√™tes secondaires, sanctuaires, collectables... Personnellement je suis √† plus de 50h de jeu et je suis tr√®s loin d'avoir termin√© ne serait-ce que l'histoire principale. On se surprend √† se balader sur cette carte gigantesque, en ramassant des objets, explorant des nouvelles zones, tuant des monstres, on se laisser porter par le vent et on explore parfois sans but pr√©cis mais avec int√©r√™t tout de m√™me !Novice ou adepte de la licence, ce jeu est un must-have pour la Nintendo Switch, m√™me au prix fort il vaut son prix !",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2019,France
"Sans conteste un excellent jeu pour nintendo switch. Je l'ai achet√© pour ma fille de 9 ans, elle est un poil jeune, mais elle se d√©brouille tr√®s bien. Quelques √©nigmes o√π il faut que je l'aide, et sinon il y a quelques sc√®nes o√π elle a un peu peur, mais √† part cela c'est le r√©gal. Papa y joue aussi, avec grand bonheur ! :-)Par contre, je trouve cela ""r√©p√©titif"", il faut toujours chercher les ""sanctuaires"", certes le jeu est √©volu√©, mais on a l'impression de faire le m√™me genre de qu√™te du d√©but √† la fin, avec des difficult√©s allant certes crescendo. Raison des 4 √©toiles et non 5 comme la majorit√© des autres personnes...Ah oui, important: la bo√Æte est en anglais, mais le jeu se joue en fran√ßais sans aucun souci, et les voix sont en fran√ßais aussi, aucun souci de ce c√¥t√© l√†. La derni√®re mise √† jour √† apporter les voix en fran√ßais (si votre console est en fran√ßais - en fait il s'adapte automatiquement √† la langue de la console, rien √† faire de votre c√¥t√©)",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,8,2018,France
"L'un des tout meilleur jeu d'aventure et sans conteste sur Nintendo Switch.Une superbe aventure, la d√©couverte d'un monde assez vaste o√π la soif de d√©couverte, de grimper les montagne et d'aller d√©nicher le moindre coffre prend aux tripes.On d√©marre les mains vide et on se d√©couvre √™tre un h√©ro, c'est g√©nial !Ce n'est pas un pur Zelda mais quand m√™me un excellent jeu √† monde ouvert.Chaudement conseill√©.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,7,2021,France
"J‚Äôai √©t√© tr√®s triste lors ce que je l‚Äôai fini j‚Äôai tout fait pour qu‚Äôil me dure le plus longtemps possible tellement je l‚Äôai trouv√© excellent. Se promener √† cheval dans des grandes prairies verdoyantes escalader les falaises admirer au loin les g√©ant √©difice, le d√©sert, les volcans, la montagne, la neige j‚Äôai √©t√© tr√®s triste lorsque je l‚Äôai fini j‚Äôai tout fait pour qu‚Äôil me dure le plus longtemps possible tellement je l‚Äôai trouv√© excellent. Se promener √† cheval dans des grandes prairies verdoyantes escalader les falaises admirer au loin les g√©ant √©difice, le d√©sert, les volcans, la montagne, la neige, ... Ce jeu est une pure merveille je l‚Äôai fini il y a seulement quelques jours, mais il me manque d√©j√†.

"Mythique! A Link to the  past, les fabuleux Ocarina of Time et Majora‚Äôs Mask. Nous autres fans de Zelda n‚Äôavions que ce triptyque fabuleux charg√©e de f√©erie et de bonheur de gameplay a nous mettre sous la dent. Mais avec ce Zelda retour aux fondements de la s√©rie avec l‚Äôopen World dont a toujours r√™ver Nintendo sans avoir la puissance pour le faire. Fan de J-RPG ou d‚Äôaventure Foncez! et en plus cette magnifique fresque po√©tique cet ode √†  un h√©ros digne de Virgil et d‚ÄôHomere se joue aussi bien en salon qu‚Äôen nomade. Nomade comme le h√©ros √©ternel silencieux au plus proche du joueur. 2016 c‚Äô√©tait FFXV trop incompris mais 2017 c‚Äôest unanime le jeux de l‚Äôannee C‚Äôest bien lui je lance un defi! Que quelqu‚Äôun me prouve le contraire",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,12,2017,France
"Nintendo s'est surpass√© avec cette nouvelle mouture de Zelda. Un open world gigantesque, un bestiaire vari√©, un aventure tr√®s longue (comptez d√©passer les 100 heures de jeu pour toutes les qu√™tes), de nombreux personnages hauts en couleur. Les gameplay para√Æt exigeant au d√©but, mais r√©v√®le de nombreuses subtilit√©s au fur et √† mesure de la progression. Les monstres que l'on √©vite durant les 1eres heures de jeu ne sont finalement pas insurmontables avec un peu de strat√©gie et de pr√©paration. Sans aucun doute le meilleur opus de la saga, √† la progression tr√®s gratifiante. Un jeu qu'il va √™tre dur de surpasser... A d√©conseiller aux jeunes enfants cependant.J'y retourne pour de nouvelles d√©couvertes !",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,10,2018,France
"J'ai √©t√© tr√®s surpris par ce jeux, je ne m'attendais pas du tout √† cela.Botw est mon tout 1er zelda (que je joue) et je pensais que je n'appr√©cierais pas ce jeux ; je me suis tromp√©, on s'impr√®gne tr√®s bien dans l'aventure et on s'amuse tout simplement.Le monde ouvert est sympa, on a envie de tout explorer et de tuer tout les monstres sur le chemin.Le jeux s'annonce d'√™tre tr√®s long et tant mieux.Ce n'est pas pour rien que ce jeux est √©lu meilleur jeux de la switch; √† achet√© pour amateur ou non de Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,8,2018,France
"Ce dernier volet de la franchise The Legend of Zelda est diff√©rent de ses pr√©d√©cesseurs et a su r√©volutionner une valeur s√ªre des 30 derni√®res ann√©es. Dans ce jeu, l'exploration et la d√©couverte sont les ma√Ætres mots, j'√©tais au d√©part l√©g√®rement dubitative, pensant que le jeu serait d'une platitude qui m'emp√™cherait de l'appr√©cier, mais pas du tout! On prend plaisir √† explorer les moindres recoins de monde gargantuesque. Il faudra une bonne centaine d'heures pour finir le jeu √† 100% surtout la premi√®re fois, ce qui est agr√©able √† savoir! Savoir que l'acheter en vaudra largement la peine.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,8,2018,France
"J'en suis a plus de 20 heures de jeu et franchement c'est un chef chef-d'≈ìuvre. Carte gigantesque, graphismes et ambiances sonores magnifiques ! Un pur bonheur ! Avec les deux DLC c'est une vraie petite bombe pleine de surprises, de l'aventure, des enigmes, des combats bourrin ou technique, de l'exploration et j'en passe... une bombe ! Je n'ai qu'un seul regret, ne pas l'avoir achet√© plus t√¥t.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2020,France
Le jeu est bien un apport il fonctionne parfaitement en fran√ßais la jaquette au recto est similaire √† la version fran√ßaise le Verseau est en anglais la cartouche et en EUR pour le format Europe l'article a √©t√© livr√© sous blister il est normal qu'il n'y a pas la petite carte en fran√ßais pour l'√©pilepsie car c'est uniquement pour les jeux vendu en fran√ßais donc pas d'inqui√©tude le jeu est bien complet et fonctionnel,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,7,2019,France
"Achet√© mercredi dans la journ√©e, il √©tait √©crit que je le recevrai samedi, et puis en faite je l'ai re√ßu jeudi et j'ai du signer pour dire que je l'ai bien re√ßu, donc s√©curiser! J'ai pu passer mon jeudi soir √† d√©couvrir le jeu, et je le trouve top! Moi qui n'est jamais jou√© √† un jeu Zelda, je l'ai trouv√© g√©nial! Je recommande, bonne livraison, jeu en fran√ßais, bon graphisme üëå",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,3,2019,France

Honn√™tement si vous ne connaissez pas ce jeu vous passez √† c√¥t√© d‚Äôun chef d‚Äô≈ìuvre du monde vid√©o ludique ! Avoir une switch et ne pas poss√©der Zelda breath of the wild c‚Äôest vraiment dommage ! Je vous le recommande ! Livraison nickel !,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,7,2020,France
"Peu de choses peuvent √™tre dites qui n'ont pas d√©j√† √©t√© dites dans les nombreux tests √©logieux de ce jeu qui a remport√©, haut la main, le titre de jeu de l'ann√©e √† sa sortie.Une v√©ritable aventure open world, des paysages magnifiques, un jeu parfois po√©tique...Un jeu qui, selon moi, m√©rite √† lui seul l'achat d'une Nintendo Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,5,2019,France
Ce jeu est absolument indispensable pour la switch. Tout est beau et incroyablement mod√©lis√©. Les sessions de jeu sous une pluie battante avec orage sont saisissantes de r√©alisme. Seul regret concernant l‚ÄôIA de certains ennemis qui laisse √† d√©sirer. Je recommande fortement ce jeu.  Poss√©der une switch et pas ce jeu est pour moi une v√©ritable h√©r√©sie. Il n‚Äôy a pas que Mario dans la vie !!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,12,2018,France
"Pour moi l'un des meilleurs open world de ces dernieres annees!Hyrule est tout simplement incroyable a parcourir, a explorer, et a ecouter!Malheureusement l'histoire peche un peu: le jeu racontre trop peu de chose.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,8,2020,France
"Je joue personnellement √† Zelda depuis la Super Nintendo. C'est d'ailleurs une des raisons pour laquelle j'ai achet√© la Switch.

"Avec le tutoriel sur le grand plateau j'ai eu peur que le jeu ne me plaise pas malgr√©es les critique unanime quant au jeu. Cependant cette peur est vite partis en d√©couvrant ce jeux tout bonnement incroyable ! Un v√©ritable monde ouvert, enfin ! √ânorm√©ment d'√©v√©nements diff√©rents √† faire.En bref, le jeu est prenant et on ne peut plus s'arr√™ter une fois lanc√© !",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,9,2018,France
"Fan des premiers opus, j 'ai renou√© r√©cemment avec la licence Nintendo. C'est donc tout naturellement que je me suis tourn√© vers ce jeu. Apr√®s quelques heures de jeu, le temps d'appr√©hender les commandes et d'appliquer les techniques apprises, je prends un r√©el plaisir √† arpenter les diff√©rentes zones √† retrouver Link dans ces nouvelles aventures.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2019,France

"Cet opus diff√®re l√©g√®rement des pr√©c√©dents, mais ne perd rien en charme. Tr√®s agr√©able graphiquement, les contr√¥les sont performants et r√©actifs, l'histoire est entra√Ænante. On peut tr√®s bien s'y plonger 15 minutes histoire de faire du craft ou des √©preuves en donjon, ou bien rester branch√© pendant 3h √† explorer une parcelle de r√©gion.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,1,2019,France

"Cela fait tr√®s longtemps que je n'ai plus jou√© √† des consoles de jeux. J'ai 38 ans et j'adorais jouer quand j'√©tait ado. Je me suis fait plaisir avec la switch et Zelda car j'avais ador√© les diff√©rents Zelda √† l'√©poque.La prise en main du jeu est tr√®s bonne. Sans lire de mode d'emploi, on apprends tr√®s vite √† jouer et faire les diff√©rentes actions.Le jeu en lui m√™me fait d√©couvrir le monde de Hyrule d'une nouvelle fa√ßon. L'immersion est excellente : des paysages gigantesques, des petits animaux partout, on doit cuisiner pour r√©cup√©rer ses c≈ìurs de vie, le passage jour/nuit, la lune de sang... On peut passer son temps √† foncer sur les qu√™tes principales ou juste explorer les alentours (perso j'aime bien visiter chaque recoin de la carte). Je sent que je vais passer pas mal de temps sur ce jeux, j'ai envie d'y jouer tout le temps.A acheter les yeux ferm√©s!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,9,2018,France
"[Je r√©dige l'avis au bout d'une vingtaine d'heures sur le jeu, il peut √™tre modifi√© dans le futur]Zelda BOTW nous plonge dans Open World vaste. Fan de la s√©rie, j'ai attendu d'acqu√©rir la Switch pour me procurer cet opus. Quelle claque.Au niveau des graphismes, certes la Switch est en-dessous de la concurrence, mais la direction artistique est magnifique. Certaines textures ont mal √©t√© g√©r√©es, mais on en fait vite abstraction. Le d√©cor est vari√©, le paysage est magnifique, je me surprends √† escalader les montagnes afin d'observer le paysage.Le gameplay est tr√®s bon, les commandes sont tr√®s faciles √† assimiler. Le ""craft"" avec les diff√©rents mat√©riaux et aliments que l'on r√©colte est vraiment sympathique, √ßa para√Æt anecdotique mais c'est vraiment un point important pour avancer dans le jeu. Le sc√©nario, pour l'instant (j'ai fini le donjon du peuple Zora, Vah'Ruta) est tr√®s bien travaill√©, bien plus √† certains moments que les autres opus sortis avant. Les cin√©matiques sont au niveau du sc√©nario, et la VF est √† ma grande surprise tr√®s bonne. Il y a √©norm√©ment de petites r√©f√©rences aux anciens jeux, autant au niveau du sc√©nario que du d√©cor. Bien s√ªr, pas besoin d'avoir jou√© √† Zelda avant pour acheter le jeu.Le d√©but du jeu est √©galement top car il permet de vous donner les bases du jeu pour ensuite vous l√¢cher dans Hyrule, √† vous de choisir si vous voulez suivre le chemin recommand√©, ou bien vous barrer √† l'autre bout de la map.Il y a beaucoup de qu√™tes principales, de qu√™tes secondaires, d'√©nigmes √† r√©soudre. 120 sanctuaires, qui peuvent contenir des √©preuves de force (des combats) ou des √©nigmes, sont r√©partis dans Hyrule afin de gagner des ""embl√®mes du triomphe"" pour augmenter vos coeurs/votre endurance. J'avais peur de me lasser mais j'en ai termin√© une trentaine et j'aime autant explorer le monde vaste afin de les trouver, √ßa m'importe m√™me plus que le sc√©nario en lui-m√™me. Mon avis pourra s√ªrement diff√©rer apr√®s 50, 80, 100, 120 sanctuaires, mais pour l'instant je suis assez confiant.Vous pouvez √©galement chercher des noix korogus, √©parpill√©es dans tout Hyrule, bonne chance pour les retrouver.Les armes se brisent mais je ne trouve pas cela g√™nant, √ßa ajoute du challenge √† ce jeu.Breath of the Wild est pour moi une r√©volution √† l'√©chelle de la licence mais aussi √† l'√©chelle du vid√©oludique. Au final, Nintendo est revenu sur ses bases avec cet opus: De l'exploration libre. C'est cela qui avait √©t√© perdu depuis des ann√©es, m√™me si on a toujours eu la magie Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,6,2018,France
"J'avais pour ma fille, achet√© le fameux ""Ocarina of Time"", et pour les 8 ans de mon petit (je sais que le conseil est de 12 ans mais bon) je lui ai offert une console et ce jeu qui me rappelais n√©anmoins de bons souvenirs avec ma fille √©merveill√©e. L√†, aussi que dire, si ce n'est g√©nialissime. L'ouverture et la mise dans l'ambiance est superbe, ensuite que du bonheur. Il est √©vident qu'il est encore un peu petit pour appr√©hender le jeu √† sa juste valeur, mais il s'y prend avec joie.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,10,2018,France

"I originally reviewed this back in March 2017 when the game first came and instantly gave it five stars. However, after revisiting the game I started to notice some cracks that I feel many have over looked or ignored. Now this is not to say the game is bad in anyway, quite the opposite in fact but they should not be ignored if we want even better Zelda games in the future.So here it is. After what seems like an eternity, the next installment in the Zelda series is here and it has made some big changes while it has been away. Some for the better and some not so much. However, is the game any good? The short answer is yes with a but.The game starts with a familiar style for the Zelda series with our hero Link waking up to the sound of a mysterious voice. After a quick change of clothes (if you want to that is!) and a new tablet like device at his side, our hero Link is ready to begin another adventure in the land of Hyrule. I feel that the opening sequence is easily going to be one of the most remembered moments in the series history as Link runs up a short hill to look over the vast land that awaits him. All of which can be travelled to and explored at the players own pace. I can easily see people talking about that moment years from now for good reason, it is amazing, and sets the stage from the get go. The music that plays is simple yet touching and fits the scene perfectly.After this, the game starts in a small area that acts like a tutorial zone, which will take around one to two hours to complete depending on how to tackle it. This area works extremely well to show the player that this is no ordinary Zelda game. You must clear four shrines which act like mini dungeons to unlock player abilities but apart from the first one, the other three can be tackled in any order and in anyway. A good example is a shrine that sits on top of a cold mountain. On my first play through I carry a lit torch to keep of the cold and yet my second play through I unlocked a warm coat and climbed up the side of the mountain. This gives you an idea of how varied the game is.As I mentioned just, the game has introduced a temperature system. This means when you enter a certain area such as a cold maintain, you will need heated clothing or cook something to keep you warm. The same for the hot places like Death Mountain where you need armour to keep you cool. This is one of the features I was worried about but has now become one of my favourite in the whole game.After that, you can go anywhere at any time. Some of the areas however are clearly designed for later on in the game as the biggest and most difficult monsters are in those areas. You can go there if you want but you will die almost instantly until you have unlocked a good amount of hearts and upgraded your armour.One of the most notable problems some will have is the games unbalanced difficulty when it comes to monsters. Some can be taken out with ease yet just a few yards down the road, the same type of monsters can deliver an instant death especially if your number of hearts are low. The game does thankfully save quite regularly so even when you do die (I said when not if) it‚Äôs never more than a few moments back but the spikes will put many people off the game and certainly newbies or younger players to the series may not be happy with seeing the game over screen time and time again. While it‚Äôs certainly not Zelda 2 hard, it‚Äôs still unpredictable how much health you will lose in a fight. However, once you‚Äôve upgraded your armour to full and have the best weapons, the game can become too easy where enemies do almost no damage but you can kill in just one hit. While not game breaking in anyway it is unbalanced at times.As for the health, that has had a complete overhaul in this game. Gone are the dropped hearts to replenish your health and in comes cooking. The game is littered with ingredients, meats and fresh fruit that have different effects depending on how they are cooked. At first, I didn‚Äôt like this idea but it does grow on you as the game progresses. It‚Äôs akin to having a health pack with you at all times. One of the biggest annoyances though is the health doesn‚Äôt regenerate which is something odd for an open world game or at least, the ones I have played such as Skyrim.The graphics in this game are very impressive for the system with a Studio Ghibli vibe to them. They are done in a cel-shading style but unlike the Wind Waker cel-shading in the world has many details. The water effects are great, the world feels alive and you want to keep exploring even long after completing the game. Truth be told, I have spent more time wondering around the world then playing the main quest.On the flip side the sound is probably the worst part of the game and especially for a Zelda game. The sound effects are spot on with every weapon making the correct sound (clanging of metal or the thud of wooden swords) and on their own get a ten out of ten. However, the music is the huge let down overall. One thing that nobody can deny is that the Zelda games have some of the greatest and most iconic video game music ever created. That is sadly lacking in this game. It does have a soundtrack but it is mostly ambient in its style. Unlike say the Elder Scrolls games that play beautiful music when traversing the world. It‚Äôs really missed when the only sounds are the wind blowing, birds tweeting and the odd piano key now and then. However, certain areas do have proper music such as Zora‚Äôs Domain and the Horse Stables that it is all-orchestral and sound fantastic.The voice acting is hit and miss. Some like the Goron‚Äôs and the Rito sound pretty good but others like the Mipha of the Zora Clan is quite poor and Zelda herself can sometimes be cringy. When compared to other voice acting in video games it does need some work. However, I do think adding voice acting is the right move for the series and if you ask me, it should have been adding back in Twilight Princess. I hope this does return for future games in the series but better voice actors are used. I personally changed it to Japanese once the update came out and it sounds a thousand times better.Now on to the gameplay. One thing that the series has brought back from Wind Waker is the ability to use enemy‚Äôs weapons and this time you can keep them. I really enjoyed this idea as each weapon has it‚Äôs strengths and weakness and does mix up gameplay for the better. However, the durability of these weapons is ridicules. They can break at the drop of a hat. For example, I found a trident in Zora‚Äôs Domain and it broke after throwing it at one enemy. Swords can break after less than five hits and so on. As I said I really like the idea but the weapons need to last a lot longer than they do. It does force you to think fast about what weapons to use but at the start of the game it is insane when you are given a stick and it breaks in three hits. I actually found myself avoiding conflict completely.The climbing feature is also something new to the series and I do believe it is not just the best thing to happen to a Zelda game but could be one of the best things to happen to an open world game in years. Everything is truly open to you and nothing is out of bounds. You can climb almost any surface making the game world truly open. One complaint I‚Äôve always had about Skyrim is getting stuck trying to climb a mountain where in this game, that‚Äôs not a problem!Speaking of the game world, it amazing to see what Nintendo have made and for the first few hours it will astound you. However, later on it will start to become a little tedious, as some areas are just too big for their own good and without a horse can take a long time to cover a short distance.Oh and another thing, for some reason everyone but the Hylians are giants. I really mean it, the Zora‚Äôs, Rito and the Gurudo are about eight foot tall! Not sure why.So on conclusion do I recommend this game? I‚Äôm going to say yes.However, many will disagree but I have found this game is not the same the second time around. Ocarina of Time is still my personal favourite and I play it at least once a year and enjoy it every time. However, wen I played this through for the second time it lost all of its fun. The shrines become boring, the dungeons can be done in less than 15 mins and it just didn‚Äôt hook me like so many other entries in the series.Oh and why have they removed the file select? Seems like a step backwards there.My first play through I rated it a strong third but at this point, I rate it as my sixth favourite in the series.The game is not perfect in anyway and many of the critic‚Äôs scores are a little too generous for my liking as they overlook some of the games minor problems but it is a triumph none the less. It has some creases that need to be ironed out in the future but if this is the direction the series is going in, then I for one will be one happy Zelda fan once again‚Ä¶.just don‚Äôt let us wait another six years for a new Zelda next time, Nintendo.Game play:-17/20Graphics:- 18/20Sound:- 15/20Value for Money:- 20/20Replay Value:- 16/20(86/100).

"My only issue is that weapons in the game break easily!Other than that I've been loving every minute, every hour, and every day when I'm able to play this fantastic game. If you're a Zelda fan then I would recommend this game to anybody especially if you aren't the biggest fan and are more of a casual fan. I would still suggest this to any both new and old fans of the series. There are guides online if you ever feel like you need help.Have fun exploring and experiencing this awesome game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,2,2023,√âtats-Unis
"Great game I can see why people like it so much, but as a long term Zelda fan it is quite a departure from the previous games, there is a lot more 'meat'  but then there is also a lot less of the controlled tightness to the narrative and progression. Also there seems to be somewhat less of the innate charm that Zelda usually has, my little boy and my wife both really like previous Zelda games but this is initially 'too big' and loose for both of them and too unstructured at the start (compared to older titles in the franchise).",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,1,2023,Royaume-Uni
"What can I add about this game that others haven't already said. Simply put, this is the most fun I've ever had playing a video game. There is just so much to do. New areas to explore, fun puzzles to solve and interesting story lines to follow. I never got bored or felt the game was repetitive. It is just incredible. The world is so vast and full of interesting things to do. Everything about this game is great, I have nothing negative to say. If you are looking for a game that is family-friendly and hours of wholesome fun, look no further. Just get this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2023,√âtats-Unis

I have a copy of this as digital download and purchased the physical one for my 7 year old son for Christmas. My 10 year old has a physical copy and they share it and both absolutely love it.It's a rare game that gets everything right and for virtually all ages - my boys forever point out things to me that I've missed and have found it to be a fantastic learning experience and learning curve.My youngest has also gone back to the 3D roots and is playing through Ocarina of Time on the N64 online service.A virtually flawless experience and as a first party title it's unlikely to ever come below the ¬£45 mark but that is a tiny price to pay for the quality and duration of joy that Breath of the Wild will bring you.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,12,2022,Royaume-Uni
"Though I'm a kid at heart, I actually started playing home video games with Pong in the 1970s.  Then it was an Atari 2600, then a TI 99 4/A, a Commodore 64, a home computer, a Nintendo, and on and on, right up through the PS4 (no 5 yet, I went a different direction and got a Switch).I start with that, because I've played thousands of video games over the span of my lifetime.  There have been a lot of good ones.  Space Invaders, Centipede, Q*Bert, Pac-Man, up through Adventure, Pitfall, Donkey Kong (also the first Nintendo console game) ...  fast-forward to games (not necessarily in chronological order) like Wizardry, EverQuest, Dragon Age, Grand Theft Auto V, Diablo II, Baldur's Gate, all the Elder Scrolls games, the Witcher 3.  Everything from Dragon's Lair to FTL to Hades.  Wasteland, Fallout, X-Com, Cyberpunk 2077.  You get the drift.And I gotta say, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WIld might JUST be the greatest video game ever made.  It just fires on all cylinders.  It would be easy to say this game is overrated, and there are actually a handful of people who believe just that - but it's not.  It's rated exactly right.  More ""10"" ratings on official video game publications than any game in history.That's probably all you need to know.  The game is fun.  Its systems work perfectly, there's plenty of room for ingenuity in approaching situations.  Combat, exploration, storytelling - it's all done right.  A world that rivals or exceeds anything Bethesda or CD Projekt Red has ever created.  Whether you've played every Zelda game up to this point or are a newcomer to the series, once you've figured out the controls and what you're supposed to be doing - you'll get lost in this world for many, many, many hours.

Brilliant game!! Very hard to get into at first because it‚Äôs not spoon fed to you as what to do and you can actually complete the game any which way that you want which is cool!! If you enjoy exploring this game is one of the best! Extremely immersive and genuinely feels real with a lot of skill required to complete tasks and progress.Felt quite sad when I finished this game because for me it is one of the best games I have played.Only down side if that the true Master sword isn‚Äôt included in this game without buying the DLC otherwise you just have to cope with using the Master sword sparingly because it runs out of power constantly.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2022,Royaume-Uni

"Tl;dr- This is like a classic LoZ game combined with the sheer exploration potential of an Elder Scrolls game and even more on top of that. It's now my favourite game and you can tell even as soon as you've reached a story milestone that you'll get hundreds of hours out of the game in one play-through if you do everything. I found it quite hard to write this review because 1. I wanted to talk about absolutely everything I like but that would just be spoiler city and 2. I honestly just wanted to stop typing to play the game more!This game has to be, by far, the best game I have ever played. I bought the Switch because I wanted to play this game though was somewhat sceptical if the cost would be worth it. I haven't had as much fun in a video game as I have with this one before. I'm aware that a lot of people who are classic LoZ fans aren't happy with this game given they claim it's ""not a LoZ game"" though for the most part I have to disagree.The base of the puzzle dungeon aspect is still there. Just because the puzzles are split out across over 100 instances doesn't mean that the feature is gone and for me it's the puzzle dungeons that make the LoZ franchise. The puzzles being split into so many smaller little ""trails"" as they are called is, to me, a really great idea. They all teach you a way to use your equipment which is useful for later trails or for the main story quest. In addition to this, you've got a massively expansive world with a great variation of terrain (each example of which brings its own hazards in enemies and how the environment affects you such as snowy mountains being dangerously cold) as well as a great combat system where you can either get by just attacking when you can or you can really learn how it works which is rewarding once you get it down. There's also the food system where you can hunt or forage for ingredients and then cook them to create various dishes which provide health as well as many different buffs depending on what you cook (for example you can cook a meat skewer with meat you hunt for which gives a good amount of health, then you can create a similar dish but with stamina-restoring properties if you add another ingredient which restores stamina when cooked to make a healing item that also restores stamina and so on). In addition to the cooking you can also brew potions witcher-style using monster drops and various herbs found in the world so you can get more effective or longer lasting buffs without the health boosts.The open-world potential of this game really impressed me. Not only through how you can just ignore the main story quest and go off to do whatever you want while still having a load of fun, but there's so many small details that make this game so special. You can climb every tree, every mountain and just about everything else that is obviously not supposed to be climbed on (though the list of things you can't climb is very short). You can fell trees with an axe, cut the log into firewood, pile the wood up and then set fire to it using any source of fire you may have (flint, lit torch, lightning strike, the list goes on) and then use this fire either as a means to keep yourself warm in a cold wilderness/at night, to open-roast food to cook it quickly and to skip time by resting beside it. Every item of clothing does something different (basic clothes, armour, cold-resistance, heat-resistance and so on).The story of the game may not be for everyone due to the style it was written (minor spoiler--- it's written in the retrospective, learn about the past as you play kind of way---end spoiler) though I really like it, you're not forced into playing through the main story quests and all there's so much additional lore to search out. You don't get a ""hand-holding"" experience with the story, quest markers on your map aren't necessarily pointing to the solution and you usually have to do some asking around or pathfinding in the area that you're pointed to in order to work out what you need to do.Overall- this game is worth buying a Switch for alone, anyone who enjoys puzzles, exploration, combat, little features which let you play the way you want to play- this is the game for you!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,11,2017,Royaume-Uni
"If you can, play this game knowing as little about what‚Äôs coming as possible - and make each place, each encounter and each discovery a true surprise. For me, the key magic of the adventure was this Discovery.I‚Äôve played various kinds of games since the Spectrum 48k without being a hardcore gamer. My favourites each had some quality about them that was unlike anything else around. Breath of the Wild is like that but I gotta say, it keeps giving and it‚Äôs the best game I‚Äôve played. The best? Come on, really?Yes, you discover the world as you progress, and there‚Äôs so much world to explore it‚Äôs amazing, from the big things (whole new areas or culture so well refined) to the little things (those hidden or background things crammed into the spaces between). It immerses you into that world and keeps you interested. And rewards you for exploring.But more than the world, there‚Äôs the gameplay itself. You discover your way of playing as you play, and the game lets you do this. This makes it accessible to all kinds of players. And though you can go in whatever direction you like you can approach new things in various ways. Wanna be cautious? Cool. Wanna run right in? Go for it. Wanna avoid it? Sure. But wanna come back later? Sure thing. The opening area treats you kindly and lets you discover your abilities and get used to the controls on a smooth but challenging gradient. It‚Äôs very rewarding.I was personally very happy the game didn‚Äôt get into RPG-style weapon-crafting. It would have been too much - I think the designers balanced the game just right without it. Having said that, I‚Äôm now ready for that in the sequel :)Personally I love the art-style and the colour palette is to me perfect for this, making the environments feel very much like the natural world. And ah the sounds, from water to rain to grass to birds, clubs, swords, rolling boulders, it all sounds just right and you really get to appreciate this sometimes when there‚Äôs just you and a wood and no music. Which said, is great: the music helps to define a place and adapts to the action or lack thereof as well. Genius.Anyway, I could go on. I‚Äôve sunk many hours into this game. It rehabilitated a sense of play and enjoyment in me I hadn‚Äôt realised had gone to sleep, and awoke old dreams. I still play it, even after 425+ hours, there‚Äôs still things for me to do, even after the expansions. And I‚Äôm so looking forward to the sequel :D",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,11,2021,Royaume-Uni

"Having never written an Amazon review for a product, I just could not hide my feelings away from this fabulous game. As you can, I'm in love with this game and being a huge Zelda fan my expectations and anticipation were exceedingly than any other video game. Having played video games for 20 years does this rank above them all? Lets find out.GraphicsThere have been mentions of frame issues from several publications, however during my playing 20 hours of playing time with the game these do not detract from the gameplay experience (Note, when playing docked frame rates do become more frequent). Aside from these hiccups, Nintendo has created there most beautiful game to date. From the beautiful vistas in the outer world to the charming and vibrant villages you come across in the game, Nintendo has done an excellent of potraying the original Legend of Zelda (1986) NES game which has inspired the design of Breath of the Wild. The varied locations, the beautiful sceneries and landscapes make this a beautiful game to behold. (9.8/10)GameplayNintendo has created their most dense, articulate and compelling gameplay mechanics in their entire video gaming history. From cooking food, to managing inventory, upgrading clothing/weapon slots...the list goes on. The game is truly massive and yet it is a harsh and brutal game that requires patience and deep thinking. The depature of 100s of shrines compared to the dungeons (which there are in this game) is a huge change that has seemingly impressed me so far. Combat is fairly challenging and it's important to workout your enemies movements, for you to strike and possibly encounter a flurry attack. One minor complaint that may differ from other individuals are the horse controls which feel stiff and unresponsive to control at times. Though if that is the only thing to complaon about the gameplay in Breath of the Wild then that is saying something. This iteration of gameplay mechanics in a Zelda game is near flawless. (10/10)ValueIs this worth you money? Considering this was made for the Wii U and those that still own one it would be hard to recommend to buy a Nintendo Switch just for Zelda as launch titles are pretty dire where there are no other big games to choosr from. However, to those individuals I say this; you miss the form factor of playing Breath of the Wild wherever you go, whether it be in bed, on a commute, airplane or even the toilet. That is the value proposition here. The game itself is more than 100 hours (plus DLC), which all the more makes it worth more than the moneys worth. To those that have never tried a Zelda game this is perfect to get into the series, whereas Nintendo and Zelda fans alike probably own the game already. This is a must buy if your purchase the Nintendo SwitchVerdictIs this the greatest game of all time? Having been ranked inside the top 5 games in history on metacritic there is no reason to believe why it may not be. Personally, I believw this is an even greater achievement that Nintendo has accomplished with the Zelda franchise and formula since Ocarina of time (which is a timeless classic by the way). But seeing how much the series has developed and changed over the years building up to what the developers had envisioned a Zelda game to be all those years ago, this is a masterpiece on open-world design. Breath of the Wild is truly breathtaking and one of the most joyous and satisfied gaming experiences I have had since maybe The Last of Us. Is this the greatest game of all time? The answer to that question is a resounding 'YES'! If not, this is the best game Nintendo has ever created and will be a timeless classic in many decades to come.

"After playing for around 5 hours, here are my initial impressions of the game. Hopefully it's helpful to people on the fence about purchasing.--Gameplay--Zelda: BotW offers virtually no tutorial and almost no hand-holding, instead teaching players about the world and game mechanics through discovering them for themselves. This makes playing the game incredibly satisfying, and a refreshing experience considering the lengthly tutorials which a lot of modern games force players into. Although you'll inevitably make mistakes during this self-learning process (you can come across enemies and situations which can 1-hit kill you if you're not careful!) there is no penalty for dying besides being placed back at your last save point. This further encourages experimentation and adventure, and I've had a genuinely good time running around the world discovering as much as I can within it.Inventory mechanics are pretty solid - weapons have a short lifespan but are plentiful around the world, so you'll find yourself rotating frequently between weapon types without the frustrating experience of being left unarmed. These are very easy to swap in/out, and can be done without opening the full inventory menu. Cooking food - essential to stop you from losing hearts and dying - is a refined and satisfying experience. Almost anything can be combined and cooked in a process which takes a few seconds and ends with a pleasing jingle. Since cooked food seems pretty effective, you shouldn't find yourself in the typical Skyrim scenario of crafting 100s of potions before going out adventuring.--Story--I can't comment too much on the story due to my current playtime, but there seems to be a good mix of emergent story (i.e. things you discover or learn whilst exploring the world) and traditional quest-based storytelling. Although the standard Zelda/Ganon/Hyrule scenario is there, this is given a slight twist, as is Link's role and past. I imagine the exact details of Link's past will be something players learn about as the story develops. Storytelling has always been good in Zelda games, and so far BotW certainly seems not to be an exception--Graphics--Considering this game can be played on a portable console, the graphics are pretty outstanding. The world is rich and colourful with a clear art direction; I'd put it somewhere between Wind Waker and Skyward Sword in terms of visual style. Although it might lack the raw graphical fidelity of many recent PC games (my primary platform), everything is clear and the world is a joy to explore visually. My only criticism would be in terms of FPS; generally BotW chugs along relatively well, but there are occasional noticable dips in FPS. This seems to happen mostly in large areas of long grass or when multiple enemies die simultaneously. It's a shame that this happens and it's a mild annoyance, but considering the how good this game looks it's understandable.--Sound--Although lacking (so far) the epic, majestic soundtracks of previous Zelda titles, BotW creates an excellent soundscape with minimalist music and environmental sound. This really enhances the exploratory nature of the game, and makes those big fights even more dramatic when a bit of music occasionally does kick in. It was a risky move, but it suits the tone of the game very nicely and furthers the sense of this game breaking away from other games in the series--Conclusion--Overall I'm incredibly happy with this game. As someone who's played quite a few Zelda titles, and games generally, BotW felt like a fresh experience and is a great joy to play. It has loose ties to previous games, but isn't weighed down by the need to stick to their formula or mechanics. Although my experience so far has been brief, I can certainly see why BotW has had unanimous critical praise. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to play some more!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"I bought a switch as a gift for my wife as a way for her to relax, not think about work etc. because she works hard at work and at home. Her mind is always going. Engineer brains. I bought a few platformers with the switch because as far as I was aware, those were her favorite.I bought Zelda Breath of the Wild for me.I showed her the begining of the game and she decided to try it. I have since lost her somewhere in the couch. I know she goes to work and sleeps but otherwise I have lost her to Zelda.My home is no longer magical. Food isn't suddenly appearing before me, cold beers aren't suddenly appearing in the fridge, dishes are overwhelming the kitchen, clothes aren't throwing themselves on hangers much less appearing clean and ready to be worn and so much more!!!I can only assume that magical things happen when she is paying attention to me.I give it 1 star because of my suffering but seriously, I give it 5 stars because of how much she enjoys the game and it's nice to see her more relaxed and enjoying a game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2022,√âtats-Unis
"At the ripe old age of 36 I'm now lucky enoughto be in a position to afford the games and consoles I dreamed about as a kid! But I've checked on Amazon and I can't find anywhere that sells time!!And time is something I wish I had more of having played Zelda:breath of the wild. The game deserves your unreserved attention, and is a return to form for Nintendo (kind of reminds me of that Mickley O'Neil rising from the Matt in snatch).GraphicsI have recently been playing Horizon Dawn on the  PS PRO and for anyone else that has, they will tell you the games looks incredible. So in contrast Zelda would pale into insignificance right? WRONG! I have had just as many 'wow' moments as I have with Horizon. Maybe the art style of Zelda is more forgiving due to its cartoony look and feel. But everything feels alive, bugs and critters buzz and jump around you as you run through fields. Leaves blow through the air, sunlight paints a gorgeous glow over the mountains that have you hitting the screen shot button. I am yet to experience any rate rate issues either, although 90% of my play time has been in mobile mode which I believe runs at 720p so that may explain why. Unless you are offended by the art style I doubt there will be anything here that doesn't make smile at how much thought has gone into it.AudioAs I said above, most of my play time so far has been in handheld mode. But through headphones everything, as with the graphicsfeels alive. Wind blowing through trees, bombs going off, all links little shouts and grunts. Nothing feels out of place. What voice acting there is, is great although I wish all dialogue was voiced over as I'm not much of a reader. Music is like a walk back through time with jazzified versions of the music of old once again perfectly suiting the mood of the game.GameplayNever has a Zelda game had so much to manage. The weapons system at first took some getting used to, knowing my big hitting samari sword would be broken after a few battles made me not want to use it. But when I bumped into a grumpy old cyclops I had know choice but to bring out the big hitter. At that point I realised this game mechanic might just actually work! Now it is like second nature. Thus is just one of the new additions to the game. There is so much to do, i think I'm probably 5% in after 12hrs play time..... After getting the..... SPOILER ALERT... glider,  I was off running to the highest mountain to glide as far as I could in completely the opposite way to the main quest. And this game is HUGE!!! In the distance you can see the glow of a star that has just fallen from the sky, on the way there you pass a waterfall, on closer inspection you find a secret cave behind the waterfall..... And so on and so on. Little puzzles are everywhere, cooking elixirs, hunting, sliding down mountains on your shield. I feel like I'm just scratching the surface and the fame draws you in to dig deeper by rewarding you every step of the way.I can't praise this game highly enough. This reminds me of the classic Nintendo games of old, and I don't think you can give it much higher praise than that. Sublime in every way!10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"If you're of a certain age, then you will have no doubt experienced the rare milestones throughout years of video gaming. Well, Breath of the Wild is that next milestone. Just as the likes of Super Metroid and Super Mario 64 established their respective genres, Breath of the wild has a ""wow"" factor that will leave you almost speechless.Link awakes from a 100-year slumber with little clue as to why so, or where he even is. With nothing more than a short promise from a mysterious female voice, a tree branch and some fetching underwear, you can guide Link around a huge, sprawling landscape that is just waiting to be explored. There are small prompts to guide you throughout the opening phase - but it is not until you start making friends that your quest becomes clear.In fact, one can travel towards the 'end' phase of the game right from the beginning; though defeat is certain. This gives you an idea of the freedom and realism on offer.The simplicity of the story serves a purpose, which is that it underpins your narrative. You play the game how you want to play it, and as such become a director. More importantly, I think what makes Breath of the Wild different to other open world games is that it has real integrity. Link must become at one with the environment to complete his quests, and that means being more thoughtful about your actions so that you can plan ahead.Do you really want to try and slay a grizzly bear that can kill you with one swipe; or would you rather sneak up, jump on it and tame it? If I have no horse to aid, should I create a bond with a dog to help scare away smaller foe? Should I traverse at night through a forest looking for acorns, or wait until the morning when squirrel-like creatures collect them?This is the so-called Nintendo Difference - a game that is built on morals we can learn from. Not a post-apocalyptic war zone with blood shed and linear objectives.While the graphics are typically Nintendo as a stylised affair (which, let's face, is a lot more interesting than hyper-photorealistic-pixel-peeping textures), I believe that it is the audio which shines through. I don't believe I've ever played a Nintendo game with such crazily accurate attention to detail - so much so that you can pass time easily through just crouching in a meadow and listening to insects, animals and the wind gushing through the grass, changing position as you move. This game also lacks a soundtrack in the traditional sense, but instead opts for incidental and atmospheric music that accompanies your style of gameplay. If you're a fan of Penguin Cafe Orchestra, then this is the game for you!As a final word on performance, I have found the game runs at a steady 30fps for almost the entirety of the play session. Where there are frame dips, it is only for split seconds during graphically demanding scenes.So don't just take my word it. The hype is, surprisingly, real - this is a treasure that will go down as the next milestone, and should be experienced by as many gamers as possible. It is absolutely breathtaking.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Not gonna lie, I will admit to being skeptical of BOTW only because it had more coverage than most games & I got the impression that it was just overexposed. So I waited for a while & got it recently and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. The story is naturally built up & I was enthralled with the world the game gave me. If you haven‚Äôt played it, go for it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2022,Royaume-Uni
"There are a few things that bother me about this game, but overall it is remarkably well done and worth a play. I wish the gameplay was a little more linear. I didn't follow any guides or anything and ended up skipping to the final boss on a whim, which is a little disappointing. It should have been much harder to get to him. . .All of the different classes of damage and protection seem at odds which makes the game a little disjointed. It is like classic Zelda that I'm always in need of arrows. . .",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,8,2022,√âtats-Unis
If your a fan of a open world game with exploration you‚Äôll love the legend of zelda breath of the wild it has an abundance of locations to discover and explore finding and completing all parts of the map will leave you satisfied even when that‚Äôs done there is so much more like side quests and for 900 korok seeds across the entire map is fun for those die hard gamer completion rate,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,9,2022,Royaume-Uni
"Big and VariedThe amount of stuff to do in BotW is pretty impressive, there are plenty of places to explore, enemies to fight, items to find and quests to complete.This is the one of the biggest change ups to the Zelda formula since its inception, no more dungeons, in the traditional sense anyway, no more collecting items to advance to places you couldnt reach before. Now its about collecting monster parts, food, wood, flowers, pretty much everything. You use most of these things to create meals and elixirs that give you additional hearts and other benefits like stronger attack or defence.In place of the dungeons there are now shrines, (120 of them in total) which are more often than not in hidden or hard to find places, these are essentially mini-dungeons with 1-5 puzzles in them; you complete these to earn spirit orbs which can be traded in to give you more hearts or stamina (4 orbs = 1 heart or 1/5 of a stamina wheel). The shrines are great fun (mostly, screw the motion controlled hammers) and often offer multiple solutions using your weapons, bows or your new powers which replace the typical Zelda tools and can be used in a variety of ways. The Shrines and Powers combined wake for a great time and made the game really enjoyable, as did the new version of Hyrule, large fields, cold mountains and firey volcanoes are nothing new but now they are obstacles as well as environments, dont go to the mountains without warm clothing (or a fire sword) or you will freeze, arid deserts without heat resistance and you will dehydrate, this makes getting around a fun challenge in and of itself.On the flip side the new weapon system or more specifically the durability system is less welcome to me personally. Weapons, shields and bows now break after a certain amount of use, this can be annoying when you loose a weapon you like but there are plenty of them all over the place so it never became more than a mild annoyance. I also found the stamina wheel to be annoying initially as i didnt think the starting amount of stamina was enough as it greatly limits your ability to run, swim and climb (which you can do on nearly any surface), but a few shrines later and it wasnt a problem. The biggest negative for me in this game is that the story is weak in comparison to earlier titles in my opinion, nothing actually *happens* in the game, its all happened before you start, you can find flash back cut scenes but they didnt really do it for me, but your mileage may vary.Overall+ Great world to explore+ Shrines are fun+ Experimenting with powers is fun and rewarding+ Combat is fun and challenging- Durability system can be irritating- Stamina dampens the early game- Story is kind of absent",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,2,2018,Royaume-Uni
"THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW :) (At the bottom is a full list of pros and cons, which is a summed up version of this review)Breath of the wild was an extremely charming and welcoming surprise for a gaming experience within the Zeldauniverse. Having fully played through the entrire game, i can say it was truly fantastic.It is a beautifully crafted world and filled with tons of content to enjoy. It is filled with some great detail, with each area of this open world, having some meaning or use - which is quite rare for an open world game, usually having irrelevant areas which are just there to fill time, this game it feels amazing to go off and explore.There are no restrictions, if you see something of interest - you can gon explore it. You will find yourself doing numerous side quests for fun and finding intriguing and challenging puzzles and enemies to test your wits and skills.Graphically this is one of the most beautiful looking zelda titles for a while, it feels as though it is a unique artstyle as many games take a modern approach to games in terms of realistic graphics, so this is a welcome differentiation.Whilst there is a story in this game, it takes more of a backseat to the world and gameplay, it is still present within the game - having a main goal backstory etc. However the story is quite nice to see and the cutscenes are fully voiced, which is a first for zelda, but was surprisingly good and a welcomed inclusion. The character of zelda felt a lot more developed than some of the previous titles in the series.GAMEPLAY, the gameplay is fantastic. There are so many new additions to the mechanics and a variety of fun random things you can do, it truly is amazing. There are so many weapons in this game, allowing for different ways to attack enemies, really keeps you on your toes. When playing the game, because the core mechanics are so much for, you find yourself creating and finding out new things to do all the time, you find yourself messing around having fun just creating stupid scenarious to kill an enemy - it can be really hilarious. The great thing anout this game is that i kept finding new things to do even late into the game, i had figured out randomly towards the end, i can pull my shield out, jump on it and surf down a hill. And i spent embarrasingly a long time doing this, and combining it with other mechanics into the game to do some really fun and stupid things.Bug wise i have personally not come across any throughout my whole playthrough, and i feel as though i did everything content wise that i could, and during this whole time i did not come across one bug.This is a truly fantastic game and i would recommend this to anyone whether you are a newcomer to the series or a longtime fan, it will truly be a fantastic experience for you. 10/10 game.Pros:Lots of contentAn amazing world to exploreNo bugs (personally)Beautiful graphicsMechanically fantasticA truly fantastic worldMusic is blended in well to fit the scenario of what is going on within the gameCons:The story, whilst still good, takes a little bit of a backseat in comparison to that of other zelda games.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,8,2018,Royaume-Uni
"This is a great game with some annoying ""features"". I love the Zelda franchise. It was the reason I brought the original Wii and it is the reason I got the Switch (although it couldn't entice me with the Wii U and that HIDEOUSLY huge and ugly controller). This takes the series and builds on it in a mostly positive way. There is very little in the way of hand holding and you are expected to go and explore and the surprisingly large open world. There is lots to see and do with many side quests that make you forget you are actually saving the world (or at least meant to be!).There are a few decisions with the game that I find frustrating. Your weapons die and you have to keep restocking them. I get that it makes you use lots of different weapons and try different tactics but when you find a weapon you like you don't want to use it as it will disappear eventually. The Witcher 3 had a much better 'degradation' mechanic allowing for the weapon to degrade over time but allowing you to repair it. The other part I find frustrating is the horse. I could be remembering wrong but in Twilight Princess you could just 'whistle' and your horse would appear. It's a little handwavium but it meant the horse was of genuine use in order to get about the huge spaces. BOTW has an even larger open world, but I rarely use the horse as you have to go to a stable to pick it up if you left it somewhere. It really limits (for me) how you use the horse. The game says you can whistle but the horse will only come if it is in ear-shot is it is ""not magical"". I get it, it is more realistic, but come on, this game has you beaming around the country using a mystical not electronic tablet that lets you take selfies without holding it! Can we just pretend that the horse (once you have fully broken it in) can be following you around just out of sight ready to come to your rescue?Aside from those couple of little rants (lol) I love this game. It is tough and challenging without feeling you can't do it. The side quests are reasonably interesting and some genuinely fun ones when you are exploring. I found one when I climbed a mountain - because it was there okay? ;) - where I had to rescue a spirit to access the shrine. It was genuinely surprising and finding out how to save the spirit was a fun challenge (even if you have to shoot it to save it?!).",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,11,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Omg I absolutely love this game , it is a single player game and it is absolutely addicting. Even when I‚Äôm falling asleep I‚Äôm still holding onto my switch to play ü§£ü§£ü§£",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,10,2022,√âtats-Unis
Best game I have every played !! I'm new to gaming after many years and got a switch as I had always used Nintendo systems up to the game cube. I'm disabled and in a wheelchair and due to the pandemic I have struggled to get out so have been house bound and that is aweful as it still continues so to stop the boring time dragging on I decided to go for the switch and had always been a zelda fan I got breath of the wild and Wow !! At first I was feeling like omg I will never be able to do this but it didn't take long for me a non gamer to get to grips with the fighting and cooking and crafting and im totally hooked !! Excellent game play and it doesn't matter your skill I had not gamed for over 20 years and now I love it the im 42 and Im no longer bored and have a fantastic way of passing the time and due to my health and spinal issues I am at times bed bound and as this is also a portable game system I can take it to bed and to the hospital as well to stop being bored . This game is excellent and if can do this anyone can I'm sure it's taken me longer to play than others but compared to how I was at the start of the game to now is a massive difference the game teaches you how to fight how to do things and that makes all the difference it's so worth playing can't wait for the sequel next year,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,12,2020,Royaume-Uni

"It was watching someone playing Ocarina Of Time that made me buy a Nintendo 64 and I've owned all the major Zelda games since. Despite this, I've never finished one of them, or even got close. The linearity, ability gating and puzzles always result in my getting stuck somewhere along the line and giving up with an unfulfilled promise to myself to come back later. So the over-a-hundred hours I've put into Breath Of The Wild aren't just more than I spent in any Zelda before it; they're more than I spent in all the other Zeldas put together.When I first wrote this review it was after the first seventy hours, and even that was more than most professional reviewers were able to play before giving their 10/10 ratings. At that point I hadn't even completed a dungeon: now I've done them all and I feel that my perspective, if not my rating, has changed. This game is no respecter of your time: the world is enormous and wandering from place to place, climbing stuff, collecting stuff & unlocking stuff will take as long as it takes. More importantly, though, when you start you think in old-fashioned terms: ""the Main Quest will be the biggest part of the game and these shrine things are just bite-sized puzzles"". As time goes on, you finish the smaller, more visible shrines and suddenly start discovering the ones that take the time & trouble. After you've spent as long doing a shrine as you spent on a dungeon, you realise that ""beating the final boss"" (which I haven't) is no metric of completion in this game.Before you can do what you have to do you have to learn what you can do, and the game teaches you nothing: you either discover it for yourself through experimentation or happen across the NPC who can give you some clues. There's never been a game that needed a guide more and there's never been a game that would be so spoiled by using one. For example, there are several major abilities that I only found out about long after I could have received them, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing because I have tens of hours still to play.Breath of the Wild is not perfect; not nearly. Everyone seems to have their own pet peeve with this game: the stamina system; the cooking system; the frame rate; the inventory system; the weapon degradation. But most players seem to make peace with these small problems as the ticket price for the journey to the next magical horizon.This was what the promise of the Zelda series was always about ... it just took me a few years to find it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Well what can I say? It's Zelda! Now this isn't the perfect game, but I have given it 5 stars because in my opinion there is nothing else quite like it on any other platform and I have had endless hours of fun and exploration.  I have spent most of my time playing Breath of the Wild in Handheld mode (which looks absolutely gorgeous by the way).  There is so much to explore and things to see and do that you can spend hours running round the map completely ignoring any objectives that you have.  I really like the whole open world idea and the shrines are a fresh take on mini dungeons.  I have a few gripes about the game though and these are only my personal opinions so feel free to agree or disagree.  First of all is the music.  The music whilst effective, is just not Zelda for me....it is used sparingly as you venture across the open world, but it does not have those memorable themes that I have come to love from Zelda over the years.  In my opinion there could've been much more effective music used in the over world and in the dungeons.  The second gripe I have is the *SPOILERS*Divine Beasts.  These are essentially the four main dungeons and whilst I think they are a good idea, they are just not dungeons to me.  They have 4 variations of the same boss, and without meaning to sound old hat I miss the Zelda formula of getting an item in the dungeon that you then have to use against the boss.  Again the music could've been more memorable for me.Those are the only real problems that I had with the game though, as I found the open world breathtaking and sometimes just stopped playing to watch a rain and thunder cloud move towards Link as the heavens opened and the rain came pouring down.  And the landscape is absolutely stunning as you run across the grassy plains with the sun rising above the mountains behind you.This game is fun! So much fun to play!  It's gorgeous in terms of it's graphics and lush landscapes and is the best game I have played in a long time.  There is so much to see and do!Well worth the money!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I purchased this game as back in the day I remember playing Zelda & recalled that it was a bit of an adventure game. It arrived speedily which was great, was well packaged & well presented, so would be ideal as a gift. So, the first mission of finding the 4 shrines & completing their tasks to obtain the orbs, - well finding the actual 4 shrines was the mission in itself! It took me almost a week to find them & complete them! At first I was tempted to give up, but I persevered & it was challenging, & I got there in the end! Once link has all 4 orbs, he has the 4 main powers of bombing, magnetism, freezing time, & he then also gets given the handglider -  which helps massively with regards to getting around from heights. This first quest prepares link to go further into the game. It gives him the skills & abilities that he needs, & it also makes him have to utilise his skills during the 4 shrine finding & completing task.The graphics are really good, and riding horseback is great, as is the cooking recipes, & what can I really say about fighting the monsters?! Only that the orange monsters are a lot easier to defeat that the green monsters. And watch out for that all seeing laser eye!Overall, a really good game of adventure. Tons of playability, & can even purchase expansion packs too. I would deffo highly recommend,  especially if you like a challenge!I hope this review has been helpful, xx",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,11,2020,Royaume-Uni

"Update: I've been playing this game for 130 hours and still only done 1/4 of the main quest line! (I've done mostly side quests, but this shows just how much there is to do!!)This is kind of like a Nintendo take on Skyrim, in the sense of an open world and very diverse and versatile combat system.It reminds me of Skyward Sword, Windwaker and Twilight Princess; all rolled into one, but in such a marvelously succinct way. You can definitely feel that Skyward Sword was the greatest influence here, particularly in the visuals and many gaming dynamics (like the sail cloth, crafting and weapons/shields that break). But many of the best bits of those 3 games are merged in.You are gradually weened into a very diverse set of controls and play styles, but after you leave the starting area there's a massive element of ""just go figure it out for yourself,"" in this game, which will be a refreshing experience for Zelda fans.Stealth, temperature, weather, climbing, cooking and potion making are just a few of the amazing additions to this game. You'd be forgiven for expecting these things to feel a bit crowbarred in or cumbersome, since Nintendo haven't ventured into too much depth with these dynamics in their past Zelda games. But, this is far from the case.Enemy AI is great. Enemies will try to use the environment against you, picking up weapons and throwing objects at you.Just a few small examples of attention to detail:* Temperature: If you're standing in the shade, your temperature drops and if you stand near a campfire, you get warmer* Stealth: Walking around in water makes more noise than on the ground* Climbing: Wet surfaces are slippery and harder to climb* Enemies: If you quickly disarm an enemy while they are throwing something at you, they won't notice and will continue trying to throw it, then will look confused when nothing happensThis game makes you wonder why you have to pay ¬£50 for some other games, that feel like they've not had 5% as much care and attention as what has clearly gone into this game. The bar has again been raised by Nintendo!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"I've been gaming since the start and very rarely does a game come along that crosses boundaries and excels like this one. It's memorable great fun for all the family - even my non gaming wife has been drawn in to the family discussions about our ""progress"". That's a 40yo man, a 6 yo boy, a 3yo boy and a non gaming 38yo woman all hooked and enthralled by this beautiful, quirky, warm, exciting, epic quest of a game.As with all open world games the range of things to occupy your time is massive and varied but in this game things of particular note for me:Tthe way the difficulty is so well done. Boss fights are stiff and need a bit of forethought but are then very doable - I haven't been frustrated once, although I've been daunted 100times! Flying is a joy, cooking is fun and the fighting is so varied and the breakable weapons mean you have to keep it moving. This balance is never quite right but they've cracked it with this game.Small things that make the world more believable are beautifully done - sheltering in a cave as a storm rages only for a tree to be felled by lightning just outside ...just a wonderful world.Then there's the hundreds of puzzles that are woven in to the game. Varying from a simple bit of fun to real day-long head-scratchers for the family. And this indeed is how everyone becomes involved; before you know it how to complete the latest Shrine puzzle is the topic at breakfast and everyone has fun working it out and then completing it.I love the bow and how you have to allow for drop at range - a very satisfying weapon.The paraglider is a masterpiece - everyone should have oneI just can't say enough.

"How do I begin... Well, I think you are ready, ready to hear what happened 100 years ago.The beginning of this game throws you in at the deep end, you have little items, and little explanation of what you need to do, minus a few visual prompts (we've all seen the E3 treehouse, so I won't go much further). From there, you then have a few quests, and then, you're able to leave the Great Plateu and your journey truly begins.This is the first Zelda of its kind, it's now non-linear, you're not forced to venture down one path, and you're more not held back by needing a certain item to progress. However, Zelda does lovingly tell you in its own unique way, that maybe, just maybe, the path you went down, wasn't quite for you yet... and by that, I mean, you'll see A LOT of Game Over screens. This doesn't make you feel annoyed though, if anything, you want to accept the challenge and try to kill the enemy, or raid the bandit hide out.Breath of the Wild, is a breath of fresh air (I know, I did it), it's a master piece, and probably one of the best open world RPGs I have EVER played, and probably the best Zelda game to date. In this, you can do whatever you like, raid a camp, do a side quest, climb the tallest mountain, be killed by Ganon right at the beginning, because you thought you were gonna be a big man, and kill him after your 100 year slumber. The possibilities are almost endless, and it has SO much to offer, that yesterday, I stayed in a town for about 5 hours, just trying to complete some side quests. I have barely dented the map of BotZ, and I'm still wanting more.If you love RPGs, get it, get it some more, and then again and again.

"For everything this game does fantastically, there's always the looming feeling that this is just not Zelda, the huge lack of real dungeons, the jarring lack of any real overworld music and the way the Master Sword and Hylian Shield are treated among much more makes this feel very not Zelda-like, I only got the Master Sword because I wanted it, I never even found the Hylian Shield but I'm told it can break... Forever... How does the Hylian Shield break? That's just silly, the Master Sword running out of power I can accept but c'mon, the shield should he unbreakable. It feels like Nintendo were so quick to series routes for their idea of innovation, and that certainly works to its benefit, it's just jarring seeing how everything is so not Zelda. A great remix of the Overworld theme plays once you get to Hylia Castle and that's amazing, but it's possible you won't even hear it for upwards of 40 hours if you want to do a lot of shrines or side quests. If you're coming at this the strict desire to play a Zelda game, you'll likely leave disappointed, but if you just want a great game, BoTW delivers in every department",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2021,Royaume-Uni

"At first I couldnt get into the game because I found it too hard. This was because I was playing it in my traditional style of main story first , side quests later (which is still possible).But after some pondering I found that you have to really invest yourself into the game to know what you're doing, and if you're not willing to do that the game might not be for you, but this title has earned its status for a reason.I had so much fun exploring hyrule and making new foods, I've probably died close to a thousand times yet I continued. The game has an effect on you which forces you to want to make ammends on your mistakes, and that I believe is the addicting part of the game.Theres so many macro details that allow you to immerse yourself , such as hitting a tree with a torch and watching it set a flame to picking up any ingredients and cooking them over fire.If the thought of buying breath of the wild has ever crossed your mind and you can afford it , then I would advise that you give it a try !",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,2,2021,Royaume-Uni

"I've been a console gamer since the late '80s, and have always had a current gen console of some description at every point of my life since that time, but in recent years I'd kind of fallen out of love with gaming. It seemed harder to find the time to play, and any sessions I did manage to fit in were rushed and unenjoyable. My 360 and Xbox One were little more than FIFA machines, and if it hadn't been for the 3DS I'd have happily 'retired' from gaming and moved on. The the Switch was announced, and I impulse pre-ordered along with this game... hoping Nintendo could deliver a masterpiece that would get me back into it all. I really believed this was nostalgia talking, and I'd end up disappointed.How wrong I was. It's the deepest, most spectacular and well-crafted game I've ever played, and immediately reminded me why I loved gaming in the first place. The landscapes, the music, the atmosphere, the physics of the world and everything in it, the intuitive control method - it's all unbelievably good and just transports you fully into the game.I've logged well over 100 hours so far, and the game hasn't been far from my mind since it launched six months ago. I completed it months ago, but can't stop playing it. I make time to play it, and the Switch's portability obviously helps with this. The idea of playing the most detailed, biggest Zelda game ever on a handheld still blows my mind a little. I'll stick it on to travel to an area of the map I hadn't previously visited. I'll go for undiscovered shrines. Or I'll just stroll about and take in the scenery. It's almost like a second life in another world, rather than a game.It's a beautiful work of art.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Im a 45 year old gamer who back in the day sided with Sega, back then you chose a side, either Nintendo or Sega and that was that. It was akin to supporting a football team, and Sega was my team.Since then my irrational teenage loyalty has waned, I've owned every Playstation & Xbox console & Ive also owned (or I should say my son) has also owned an N64, DS, Gamecube & WII. I've always appreciated the TLC that had gone in to games like Windwaker, Mario Sunshine, Smash Bros & Metriod etc. The game mechanics were always flawless but I had never had that wow moment or had a real connection with a Nintendo game. I just preferred GTA, Red Dead, Skyrim, God of War etc. I put it down to my age & that Nintendo was aimed at the younger me who had chosen Sega.Then this Christmas my son had a Nintendo Switch. After a quick blast on Breath of the Wild I was impressed. Then after another go I was even more impressed. And then I was absolutely transfixed. The game is absolutely glorious! The game design & mechanics are flawless. The graphics are beautiful, & the open world is engrossing & extremely challenging.This game is absolutely captivating and oozes charm.

"I have played all the games in the Legend of Zelda series and I must say this is definitely as good as (if not better than) Ocarina of Time, which is still the highest rated game on Metacritic.Breath of the Wild (BotW) is vastly different from any other game in the series, as once the ""tutorial"" section is finished, you can go to any corner of Hyrule. No where is off limits provided you are equipped with the right clothes, food and have enough stamina to climb and swim long distances. You're given all the Sheikah Slate abilities you will need throughout the ""tutorial"" rather than having to unlock them as you progress through the game. It's up to you to figure out how is best to use the abilities to succeed.There is a strong survival element to BotW which I see a welcome change to the series. It can be difficult at times, but once you learn how to effectively dodge, counter and apply your Sheikah Slate abilities to both enemies and to the environment, a whole new world of possibilities opens up. (For example, setting fire to a big patch of grass can cause a nice little updraft to start paragliding from rather than jumping off a mountain or building)I am over 45 hours in and would say that I am probably half way through the game. I like to take my time and I often find myself getting distracted by the scenery or just wandering off the beaten path looking for something interesting (you're never far from a new challenge)I can't get enough of this game at the minute and highly recommend it to anyone who owns a Switch (I haven't tried the Wii U version so can't comment on the performance).",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Admittedly it took me some time to get into Breath of the Wild as it is somewhat a departure from the Zelda I know and love and there are still some things I dislike and truth be told I still prefer previous more driven style with no open world and larger dungeons but the more time I put into BotW the more I fell in love with it.I'm not really a big fan of the more grinding element of having to grind for raw ingredients which might be for eating, upgrading or selling for rupees but it's not a necessarily a bad thing and a lot of people like this.I was on the fence about the difficulty at first as I felt Zelda shouldn't be an overly difficult experience but again the more you put in and level up, get new gear and simply improve then you come to appreciate what Nintendo were thinking.The graphics are stunning, the open world fun to explore and the Shrines (mini dungeons) are very fun to figure out and always give a sense of satisfaction once you've worked out the solution and complete it.You will get potentially easily get a couple hundred plus hours out of this game as there is so much to do and see.Breath of the Wild's sequel has just been announced so if you haven't I highly recommend jumping into BotW asap.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,6,2019,Royaume-Uni

"Carried a lot of hype when it came out which puts me off honestly, so at the time I thought I‚Äôd leave it and buy it when it all dies down a bit.Absolutely blown away by this Zelda, this is what you call a GAME. I can already tell this has some serious gameplay hours and I can‚Äôt wait to keep progressing through it.I haven‚Äôt 100%‚Äôd many Zeldas over the years having only completed it on the 64 as well as Wind Waker but I feel this one is definitely going to be keeping me gripped and will be added to that list.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2022,Royaume-Uni

"I'm a huge Zelda fan and have been playing Zelda since the beginning.I was really worried about this Zelda the same I was originally really worried about Wind Waker. And like Wind Waker, I was very, very pleasantly worried about nothing.Here are things that aren't great about Breath of the Wild:Music : aside from 2 or 3 tracks the music is extremely mediocre. It's a disappointment compared to past Zelda games where the music is legendary.Dialogue : Sometimes the dialogue choices that you are forced to choose from are extremely frustrating because they force you to sound like a petulant little brat. You'll have a choice between petulant child and arrogant turd.Monster diversity - There's very little of it.Dungeons - They aren't the same and the equivalent ""shrines"" don't add up to the usual Zelda dungeons.Story - About as basic/generic/boring as you can get.DESPITE all of this, this game is easily 5 stars because of how fun it is and how many hours you'll put into it. It's not my favorite Zelda game ever, but it's certainly the one I've spent the most hours playing, and that's within a month of owning it. I've put a good 400 hours into it over 3 playthroughs. Never have I beaten a game only to be excited to literally, literally immediately start back up.The fact that this game has so many flaws and yet is so amazing and so wildly successful and critical received tells you just how good it is.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Let me start this review by saying that this is my introduction to the franchise. I‚Äôve heard of the Legend of Zelda before, I‚Äôve watched countless videos talking about the rich history of Hyrule and all of the games; but I‚Äôve never picked up and played one before.I saw the immense popularity this game had gotten over the last year which swayed me to lay down the money and get the game.And let me say, without a doubt it is easily one of the best games I‚Äôve played this year and this past decade.Allow me to explain why:This game is one of the games where player freedom is put centre stage, and allows for some truly immersive gameplay. Without going into spoilers, any busurd and stupid idea you might come up with is possible. I would liken the player freedom in this game to something like Metal Gear Solid 5, which also allowed complete expression through the mechanics.Also like Metal Gear Solid 5 though is that the story is easily the weakest part of the game, and almost feels like an afterthought.Despite that though, I can tell that this game is going to continue to bring me back for dozens upon dozens of hours and allow me to create my own experiences that no other game can quite match.TLDR; Nintendo have still got it and remain the centre of innovation.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,9,2018,Royaume-Uni

"It‚Äôs a very different Zelda title, but it is quite simply brilliant. It may take some gamers time to get into because it‚Äôs all about Hyrule and learning about the environment while surviving off it as well. You can take pride and time to develop link and learn about the world and how to combat the evil that lies out there. Typical Nintendo have made a very slick combat system for the game, but it‚Äôs about choosing your battles and using the land to gain advantages where you can. The game looks amazing and plays like a dream. It certainly takes a bit of time to open up but the puzzles you face in the shrines, the open world environment to explore in, the combat, and the climbing. Even gathering ingredients for the cooking to gain an advantage or help survive a bitterly cold mountain you have to explore to find something is hugely fun and rewarding as you see Link improve his abilities and enhance his equipment or amour. It‚Äôs a fantastic game that any RPG/open world/Zelda fan must experience.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,6,2020,Royaume-Uni
"This is by far the best game I‚Äôve ever played on any platform ever. Lol‚Äî sounds dramatic but seriously this game has everything you‚Äôd want: adventure, mystery, action, magic, exploration, treasure, and so much more. You‚Äôre free to explore the insanely detailed terrain however you want, follow certain main story goals or take a side quest detour. I‚Äôve never been more immersed in a game before in my life.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,1,2022,√âtats-Unis
"If you play this game to blast through the story, you'll probably be a bit disappointed, but that would miss the point. The true joys lay off the beaten track. The huge map can seem a bit empty at first glance, especially when compared to the dense clockwork of puzzles that made up previous entries in the series, but allow yourself a moment to relax, explore and get sidetracked and you'll discover that the best stories in this game are those that write themselves as you play. The way that everything reacts with everything else in this game creates a toybox you can experiment with for tens of hours and never get bored. I'm far too lazy to go into much more detail than that, but trust me, this is one of the most enjoyable games of the last decade or so. Buy it, sit back with a cup of tea and have fun.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,2,2021,Royaume-Uni

"With the Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Nintendo has re-written the rules of how to create an open-world RPG. It is absolute joy for a seasoned gamer as there are not many instructions given and you have to figure out most of the mechanics yourself. The gameplay is so smooth and fun. The open-world is expansive and no area is out of reach after the initial phase of the game. You are only limited by your actions.Deducting 1 star because I did buy it for an exorbitant price but it is available at affordable rates if you buy it at the right time.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,8,2021,Inde

"this is the best ""video game"" i have ever played - i am not a hardcore gamer, but due to my age, have played a fair few titles over many years, and this is the most solid, comprehensive, huge!! experience i have had the pleasure to immerse myself in.having seen the abundance of 5 star reviews and praise for BOTW, i did feel as though this was potentially hyperbole from zelda/nintendo fanboys, but what other choice of game was there for us day 1 switch owners?admittedly, even for the first few hours of play in breath of the wild, good as it was, i thought those were still very high praise reviews indeed, little did i know that the arc of the game had yet to unfurl into what it would soon become, which is nothing short of genius in my book.i am a slow-ish player having spent a few hundred hours of play, and only just finished all of the shrines, side quests, shrine quests, memories, divine beasts, and ganon a few weeks back, my only teeny tiny gripe with the overall completion system is i am only showing 32.34% done!!this is because i only have 122 korok seeds out of about 900 - maybe too many? :) that's a positive negative though, complaining about too much gameplay is better than saying there wasn't enough! can't wait for the DLC'sp.s. having wolf link to accompany me on my travels of hyrule was another inspired touch!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Probably one of the best adventure games out there and its nearing 3 years old already.make sure to select your missions on the shiekah slate and it will give you the location of the mission on the map, there are a lot of side quests compared to the main story ones, i have a feeling most people who found this game boring were just wondering around aimlessly not knowing where to go or not knowing the difference between side missions and main story on the slate. Also the first area of the game (the great plateau) is basically one big tutorial and its easy to go and explore which will get boring because your character has no weapons or special abilities or armour (you're practically level 1), you have to complete all of the tasks before you can leave it and explore the rest of the game with out restriction, once the great plateau (Tutorial area) is completed then the game truly shows its worth.=) Have fun!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2020,Royaume-Uni

"This game is absolutely deserving of its perfect scores. An absolute masterpiece on all accounts.I've got a super high end watercooled pc so i know good graphics when i see them. The lighting effects,  the scenery, the 'cell shaded' style really works in the world of hyrule. The music suits every scenario, birds chirp from every corner of the room and the mysterious voice echos around the room. Physics on a zelda game,  never thought I'd see the day tbh. Everything you do can have an effect on the world around you. Experimentation with cooking ingredients gives you all sorts of potions,  elixers and power ups. For instance,  the cold near killed me. No problem, throw 5 chilli peppers in a dish to make a strength and cold resistance meal. Seriously fantastic stuff from nintendo here.The open world of hyrule is vast and huge and I literally can't wait to explore it all. Littered with bogoblin hideouts and outposts and vast mountain ranges,  its a sight to behold and you will be sharing your pictures on social media, trust me!The best thing is I'm just getting started, I'm only just scratching the surface here.Please please please, just buy a switch if only for this game. Its nintendos mona lisa, their sistine chapel, their statue of david! Its that good. If this is a taste of things to come then I can tell you nintendo have cemented their future financially, as well as in the history of gaming. For that I thank them,  and you will too.

"It has beautiful graphics. The puzzle dungeons are second to none, some of the best in any ARPG of all time. And the variety of ways the enemies interact with the environment and each other is spectacular.And nearly every other aspect of the game is aggravating at best and irresponsibly and unprofessionally designed at worst. You're a wet paper bag that is OHKed by everything for most of the game, and not from lack of skill, but because all enemies were made to be bullet sponges to artificially boost the difficulty. RAIN, 'nuff said. NO MUSIC. You walk slow, you run slow, you climb slow. Cutscenes and unspoken dialog are unskippable. Repeated popups are unskippable. NO MUSIC. Weapons breaking could easily have been made non-frustrating, but it was not. NO MUSIC. Puzzle dungeons are cool but there's no classic dungeons - the big puzzle dungeons don't count and there's only 4 of them anyways. And there's 120 of them - if you don't do a large percentage of the 120 of them, you're still a wet paper bag trying to fight Gannon. NO MUSIC. The lead designers of this game need to be strapped down to a chair and forced to actually play through their own game, from end to end, with no help, on camera. They'd be screaming for the same minor changes necessary for smooth gameplay that the rest of us have been screaming about, and maybe their ego would come down a few notches. NO MUSIC. Beware playing this game. Some aren't bothered by these issues, but some place this last in the entire line of games in the entire franchise, and I'm one of them. NO MUSIC.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,5,2021,√âtats-Unis

"A good game, really the best reason to buy a Switch. The open world is the star of this game. It is huge and you can go pretty much anywhere. It is marred by the bizarre breaking weapons for me, however, and the story takes a back seat, being conveyed only through flashbacks that really seem just an add on, so I didn't feel like I had been on an epic adventure as I had with previous Zelda titles or develop any meaningful empathy for the characters. Also, completionists will be disappointed; the grind to find all Korok seeds and complete all shrines is exactly that, just a grind, and the reward, even if you are hardcore enough to do it, is pathetic. Oh, and the DLCs really are not worth it, they just add more shrines essentially. But this isn't a review of the DLCs. If you own a Switch, this is the best game on it, period, but the deliberate prioritising of open world freedom over narrative is weighted too far in favour of the former to really cement a place in my video gaming memories as a classic.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,7,2018,Royaume-Uni

"I recently purchased Zelda Breath of The Wild after having played my niece‚Äôs copy a while ago and finding it very addictive. I have not yet completed the game yet but I have not once felt that it lacked.The atmosphere and environment of the game will have you in awe as you work and explore your way around a vast, open and beautiful world. You scavenge for items, you hunt for food, you climb to highest mountains to get the best views and you make your journey truly yours. Game works amazing on a HD TV but I still prefer playing handheld just because it feels a bit more immersive for me. Make sure you have a good charge on your Switch though as the battery will drain quite quick if you want to only play Zelda.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,6,2020,Royaume-Uni

"A sandbox and a zelda at the same timeI miss old school dungeons. New dungeons are very easy or incredibly, stupid dificult (giroscope not well implemented)Open world is amazing. Enemies can be repetitive, farming diferent items, discovering every part in the map, its being though to discover something or to hide something,Teleporting makes game enjoyable. As map is quite bigThe idea of the towers i don like it (copy assassin creed, far cry)I miss the main zelda theme or more music in the open worldIts very addictiveI would give 4of5 because i miss a couple of things, but the game is very good. It feels it is very well done.Graphics are beautiful with diferent design in every part of map and rich of colours and secretsSounds are similar to every zelda but now we have voicesMusic is not bad but i miss some masterpieceGameplay is responsive and well implementedDuration depends what you do and how you do itWithout guide its quite dificult to find some temples.And there are plenty minigames and puzzlesWhatelse  can i say it's a must have for switch owners",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,12,2018,Royaume-Uni

"The best game I have ever played! At least best modern game. (Can't beat Super Mario World).Ok that may not be the case for everyone. But I was seriously not expecting how good it is. I was excited for the Nintendo Switch for games like Snipperclips to begin with, and Mario kart/Splatoon/Mario Odyssee later on. But I found that I have spent a lot of time already playing this game.It is no short game either, it has a lot of side quests, and the open world is Huge and NOT EMPTY as some were worried about. There are lots to do everywhere.But on a more serious note, it is a brilliant game, with much to do. It still feels like a zelda game, despite a difference in the way you play. The story is very gripping, and is more so if you have played previous Zelda titles.The controls are good, the visuals are good, (yes there are games with better graphics, but you can only go so far, and it is still a big leap from previous gaming generations).The title in a way describes it well...

"It seems futile to write a review on this game when everything has already been said by greater and more established gaming websites, YouTube channels, magazines, PRACTICALLY EVERYONE AND THEIR DOG.  But I like to chime in with my two pence worth when I purchase something.It's a fantastic game.  Nice depth of story and combat mechanics revitalise the long established Zelda/Link franchise.  A substantial number of gaming hours can be put into the game if your intention is to cover all the quests, side quests and items to be found.  I've yet to complete it having purchased it on its launch (March 2016) but this, in my opinion, shouldn't be a game that you should run to complete - in this age there always seems to be a hurry to 'beat' a game.  The beauty of the Nintendo Switch system is that you can take the game with you on the go and resume a title as and when you like with little to no delay.This is a flagship title for the system and despite being available on the Wii U comes off as the better version.  A must have title for the system.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,10,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Have always been a Nintendo fan but recently fell out with games consoles in favour of PC gaming.  I wanted the Switch purely for Mario Kart and hopes of a new Pilotwings game.  Since there are still hardly any games, I plumped for Zelda despite being pretty ""meh"" about the whole thing (loved Ocarina of Time but was a bit Zelda'd out!).This game is awesome.  Do not worry about the comparably low power of this console because Zelda has the power of Nintendo under its belt! Little touches like fish swimming in lakes, birds flying in the sky and little fairies buzzing around trees are the sorts of immersive little touches that only Nintendo bother to add to their games.Despite borrowing a little ""tower climbing"" from all the same-old-same-old Ubisoft games, Nintendo have done it right here - getting to the top lets you look out across the map - and the map, oh the map...  it is huge! We've been playing for 2 weeks now exploring here and there and floating off mountains using the paraglider and still only just uncovered half the map!Lovely, absolutely lovely.

A great game only one problem it's extremely inconsistent hoe some creatures oneshot you.An how the same creatures sometime only do 3 hearts the bosses patterns are inconsistent for example thurnderblight Ganon sometimes charges you and sometimes he throws balls before charging you.Once you get to the third phase it's even worse he can brake your shield or make you drop it but it's extremely difficult to run from him.While fighting him during the third phase I noticed a lack of patterns and most of his attacks can kill you in one hit.The stamina system also ruins the game as you can't climb in rain and simple things take up stamina bars.The fact that you weapon can break is a tremendous problem too.I fought waterblight Ganon and I walked In with 6 weapons left with one.These mechanics are kinda stupid.Since once a player loses all their weapons during a boss fight they are completely screwed.,3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,7,2021,√âtats-Unis
This was working great but then the card stopped reading after 1 month of use and i only played it for about 10 hours in that month. My other games still work so its not the console.,1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,2,2023,Royaume-Uni

"I know, sacrilege, but I can't give something 5 stars just because everybody in the world did!  Don't get me wrong, the scale is epic, the story is detailed, the puzzles are great, and the hours of gameplay in this is bordering on the ridiculous.  But, that's part of my gripe - there is just too much to do and too many combination of things to get my head around.  Just don't have the time or energy to do this game justice, which is a shame, but that's why I gave it 4 stars.  I can totally understand though, why fans of the series gushed over this game, and I'm sure the follow-up will be just as good.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,10,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I bought this not expecting to get along with it - I was raised on Sega so anything with this many control buttons (switch) gets a bit confusing for me. I needn't have worried, it has beocome the most popular game in our house since Mario racing! Both my partner and at least one of the children have completed it multiple times for the story, for the achievements, and for completionist attempts. Well worth the cost given how good the game is and the amount of play time we've got out of it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,12,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I play a lot of games across every console imaginable and this is definitely one of the best I've played. Don't be put off by the art style I'm in my late 20's and this game offers plenty of challenges. The best part about it is that you can walk in any direction at any point and be constantly finding things to do - the game world isn't just big for the sake of it. I've played for >25 hours so far and feel like I've only just got started. I don't normally spend much time away from the main storyline/quest in big games because I tend to find them long enough as it is but this one is a definite exception to that.One suggestion - don't ruin all the surprises for yourself by watching videos or reading too many spoiler articles online, the best moments are the ones where you stumble across something that you never expected and the feeling of ""wow"" is irreplaceable.The only downside is whatever game you play after this is going to feel really rubbish in comparison! I really hope Nintendo can produce more games of this quality for the Switch going forward.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I was about 10 months late to the Switch Party and only bought one because Bayonetta 1, 2 and 3 was announced for it - THIS game had already been crowned Game Of The Year by quite a few outlets. Playing it now I can see why.This game, at a glace, may seem like: ""Oh they've made a Zelda game open world like GTA or Skyrim..."" But the thing is, they've actually made a Zelda game that does everything better. The more hardcore Zelda fans might boast about how they finished it with 3 Hearts while only wearing their blue shorts in 39mins... but this game has more to offer than that... and DESERVES more from the player I think.I advise any new players, like I was, to just ignore the internet and jump into the game and learn how to cook from trial and error, learn how to fight each foe, seek out those secrets. I've been playing this for days and I don't even feel like I am ""avoiding the main quest"" or ""Looking for stuff to do"". Every journey I make ends up an exploration, the world in this game is very well done.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
Purchased from Game Planet Implex for 5200/-.Must buy game. However if purchased pre-owned it will be a better deal as the new one import date is old therefore you will not receive Nintendo gold coins as per Nintendo reward program.Hence it makes no sense to purchase new copy rather purchase digital version or pre-owned (game card) version.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,7,2021,Inde
"I left this review for a while whilst I played through hundreds of hours before making a judgement. I considered many points that I was going to include in my review, but the fact is, unless Nintendo developers are going to read this and take on-board my minor annoyances and suggestions, there is no point. All you care about is whether it is any good and worth a go. And to that question, the answer is it doesn't get much better than this.It has now been nearly a year since I played it, so I have had plenty of time to reflect and change my mind. Now I just miss it. There are a few disappointing elements but it really is a master piece and I expect it will go down in video game history.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,5,2019,Royaume-Uni
The best game I've played in years,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2022,√âtats-Unis
"Has to be one of the best games ever written.  Beautiful world, richly populated with people, flora and fauna and loads to do.  Wander aimlessly taking in the scenery, stock up on ingredients for cooking up health and stat boosting meals and elixirs, take out the bad guys for loot and weapons, plan your attacks using bombs, magnetic manipulation, mastery of time or ice pillars. Solve the puzzles in the shrines to upgrade hearts and stamina, glide from towers and mountains, catch, tame and ride horses, find koroks to upgrade inventory slots, mine rocks for minerals and precious stones, use the camera to take pics of everything you come across, swim in mountain lakes and maybe even up waterfalls if you're lucky, help many people on numerous side tasks Oh, and there's the main quest to tackle too. All activities play out in a logical fashion and the game always seems to remain true to its own internal rules and systems.  If you have a Wii U or are thinking of getting a Switch get this game and lose yourself in Hyrule, it's a beautiful, dangerous land and you won't want to leave once you start.  10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Brilliant game , and I highly recommend it. This is the type of game that‚Äôs fun even when ur not playing it. Since I have a projector, I get to enjoy this whole new engrossing world on my whole entire wall, and lots of times my family comes to watch and commentate, and it‚Äôs fun for all. Literally spent about 50 hours completing 10% of the game. Then again I‚Äôm a perfectionist and won‚Äôt rest until every side quest is complete, but overall brilliant game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,1,2021,Royaume-Uni

"Solid gameplay, fun open world. My only complaint is that I have a switch lite so some of the tilting puzzles are almost insanely difficult on a portable device!DLC is also worth picking up, but none of the new outfits that are found in it have a decent armor rating, so they‚Äôre almost purely decorative and rarely worth wearing.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,3,2021,√âtats-Unis

"I finally beat the story last night and I want to dive straight back into Hyrule to discover all the secrets that still await me. This adventure is a little different to other LoZ games but it's no worse for it, in fact it's better than all of the others. Sure there's no big dungeons but BOTW straddles perfectly between handheld accessibility and home console grandeur. The shrines are just the right size to beat on a commute, whereas the vast open world is a sandbox for explorers and adventurers to seek out formidable enemies or hidden treasures.An absolute masterpiece, though still with a couple of minor flaws. The sequel needs to have fishing and the ability to pet the dogs, then it will be perfect.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,6,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I have been playing computer games for so long it makes me feel old just thinking about it. The last great game I played and got totally engrossed in was Fable. I read a review on this likening this to Fable and I had to buy it. To be fair I've always been a fan of Zelda, wether it be on the game boy, yes the original game boy, the Nintendo 64 or any other platform it's been created for. This has massively ticked every box a zelda game should and so much more. Having completed it after 100's of hours of gameplay I'm a little sad but I'm looking forward to the add on material. It just a game that keeps on giving, every part of the world is different. Play this, I promise you won't be disappointed. I have a habit of collecting so much in a computer game the game gets boring and I never finish the storyline, I never even for a moment thought that was going to happen with this. Best game in years.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"For me, Wind Waker was the peak of the Zelda series. I was hoping for more of the same, with different graphics. However this game takes on the open-world RPG approach, somewhat similar to the large, open-world Skyrim, but with the playfulness of Zelda.The game is simply huge. I was about 20 hours in when I got told the game is well over 100 hours. If you've got time to play games, this is a good, long adventure. if you're wanting a game to pick up and put down, then you might struggle to ever beat this one. Overall, you get your moneys worth, and it's an enjoyable adventure. Giving it 4 stars. Wasn't overly keen on the RPG-element. I'd rather they left that to Skyrim/Final Fantasy.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,1,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Love the zelda series in games, so obviously was dead excited to get this! The graphics were amazing the game is huge as I still have not finished it yet. I do like to take my time with games, this game is abit different to the others though obviously its bigger and doesn't have as many dungeons in it more trails.Other then that if you have never played the zelda series or want to try it or like your rpgs this is suck a great game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,11,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I had my concerns if Nintendo would pull off a massive open world game, but they were put to rest shortly after booting up the game for the first time.The map is enormous, but so much content for players exploring this world, to the point that its easy to forget your main objective with the side quests, shrines and collectibles. There is so much to find.The different power ups and items Link receives throughout the adventure helps make the world feel like a massive playground.The graphical art style is a sight to behold. It's hard to believe that this game looks this beautiful when played in handheld mode. The musical approach is unique but it works within the world. Through my experience it changes based on the situation, particularly when up against some of the game's bosses.This is the main game anyone should buy when purchasing a Switch, first time I have played witness to a launch title of this caliber since Super Mario 64. Just rating it 5 stars would be an injustice to this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

The best game I‚Äôve ever played! This truly brought so much nostalgia and brilliance to a Nintendo game that I‚Äôm at a loss for words. As a fairly movie gamer this RPG game is ‚Äòbreath‚Äôtaking - The attention to details and the nods to past Zelda games are fantastic! It‚Äôs gaming style is easy to follow along with and it just so expansive you will spend hours and I mean HUNDREDS of hours exploring this world!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
Sadly i think the people who have reviewed this so highly have never played any of the older Zeldas  It's not a patch on ocarina of time or majoras mask or even a link to the past it's sorely let down by a terrible stamina system and weapons that break even the master sword needs to recharge which is terrible then there's the world which whilst huge its hampered by temperature changes and huge cliffs and is also way to empty then there's progression which is pretty much none existent i was finding myself been one shotted in the late game by essentially the same enemies I've killed throughout all because of having to change armour for different areas ! Now it's not an awful game i enjoy the shrines and it does make most of the limited power the switch panther but it just isn't a zelda game to me,3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,1,2021,Royaume-Uni

Great game. Even for a 40 yr old me its tricky and needs a lot of thinking and combat training. Quiet a long game. Its taking me almost a month around 2 hrs everyday five days a week.

"I cannot express the simple pleasure of capturing your first wild horse, taming then naming it and then just riding off together over vast grasslands.....,cooking that perfect dish with ingredients you have gone out and harvested yourself. Climbing huge mountain ranges through extreme weather, feeling on top of the world. Rafting down fast paced rivers with just a leaf. I am meant to be saving the world but I am having too much fun exploring it. A game that can make you feel like you are travelling through ancent world's.All this and puzzles, trials, side quests and all the usual extra-special Zelda moments.It isliterally a game-changer in the console world..Are there any downsides? It is addictive on a whole new level....you have bee warned!!!And the story line is scary for little ones so when kids are around just settle for catching a horse or go bug hunting :).Enjoy the freedom!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"This is my first Zelda game and after the first 10mins I didn't realise what the fuss was about.  I then spent another 30mins deciding if I would keep the game or not.  I'm so glad I kept playing.  3 weeks later and I have played this game every day and at every chance I get.  I am still not anywhere close to completing the main game and still have all the side challenges to start too.  As a gamer for 25+ years I think this is the best game I have ever played.  The imagination of the story, the open world scenery and gameplay, the range of difficulty of the puzzles, the creativity needed to survive through harvesting food to cooking and receipes for elixirs, the weapons, the enemies etc.  It's amazing and will be game of the year, decade and possibly best game ever.  10/10.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"While graphically the game looks amazing, I absolutely hate the stamina system because it severely hinders you for most of the game. Especially with such a heavy focus on traversing large terrain and climbing up mountainsides or gliding. All of this requires stamina and until you grind out a ton of shrines to increase your stamina, You are gonna be severely limited very easy on.And on top of that, The weapons now break and since most of them break after only a couple of hits, You have to be very selective about what enemies you choose to face and the only weapon that doesn't break is the master sword so good luck getting that. These two things are a very annoying change and until you grind out at least half of the shrines in the game to level up your health and stamina, You're pretty much gonna be going nowhere fast.BOTW frustrates me beyond my wit's end because of these ridiculous changes that make the game needlessly difficult when it didn't have to be.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I think I read somewhere that the whole world of Twilight Princess fits in just the starting area.  I believe it.This game is huge!  There's so much to do!  This is, without question, one of the best games I have ever played.  It's a wonderful experience from start to... well, I've finished the main game but I'm still playing because there's still so much to uncover.  You will get hours of joy from this game; it's incredibly fun.I haven't touched the DLC yet as I want to find everything the base game has to offer, but I will be buying it to try Master Mode once I'm ready.I only really have a couple of gripes, such as some things being Amiibo-exclusive (e.g. Epona, the Twilight Bow and the Traveler's Bridle and Saddle, to name a few) and a couple of the motion-control shrine puzzles.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,10,2018,Royaume-Uni
"One of the greatest games ever made. Takes the attention to detail and incredible game design found in all the Zelda games and applies it to an open world like Skyrim all while adding a bunch of tricks of its own. A beautifully realised world where you can go anywhere chocked full of puzzles to solve, secrets to find, monsters to fight and quests to complete. Looks absolutely stunning as well, one of the prettiest games on the Switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,8,2020,Royaume-Uni
"This is without a doubt the best game I've played.It's not often you can play a game so open as this and with endless ways around completing tasks and quests.When I bought the switch, I was a little worried about the fact that on paper, the console isn't as powerful as the competitors. However, Breath of the Wild has proven that power isn't all that's required to make a game beautiful. The art style, landscapes and gameplay flow and awe you as your story throughout Hyrule continues.So far I have between 40-50 hours gameplay and I've still not completed it. This is probably due to the fact I've enjoyed exploring, climbing and running for dear life at times before I remember I was just about to look for the next part of my quest.Overall, extremely impressed.

"Absolutely fantastic game.I have played many games and this has to up there with the best of them. I've not played any Zelda games previously yet I still managed to easily follow the story line and learn about the main characters. The game world is incredibly interesting and kept me exploring it for ages. The main quest will take a decent amount of time and there is also several side quests to keep you going if you don't want to follow the main quest. The art style is definitely unique but doesn't' feel wrong and helps creates a great atmosphere. The game also has a nice difficulty curve, it may seem relatively hard at first but when you get used to the mechanics you'll quickly get better but at no point have I ever found the game too easy.If you have a switch this is a must have.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,10,2017,Royaume-Uni
We have always loved Zelda and this one certainly doesn't disappoint. Would definitely recommend.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,1,2022,Royaume-Uni
Quite simply the best videogame of all time. I am absorbed after 8 days playing and at night I dream of discovery and shrines to uncover. The sheer thrill you get just from trying things out is intense. The game world is the size of 7 entire cities from gta5 and the scope for doing things and being creative is much higher. This map is bigger than any other videogame I can think of and contains thousands of little bits to do everywhere. Breathtaking! Smashes the Witcher 3 for game size and scope of design. Just a flawless product and crazy that we can even get something this perfect and this complete for normal retail prices of ¬£45-¬£55. Intense value and a game noone can hope to best within 3 months. This beats any experience I've ever been lucky to have on any system of any type over the decades. I'd give it 99/100.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"The game does a lot of things very well: the graphics are lovely, the gameplay is fluid and fun and the world is fun to traverse but it is by no means perfect.While the world space is expansive and fun to travel, it is sparse, best way to describe it is ""Wide as an ocean, deep as a pond"". Enemy camps and boss battles are fun, shrines are a fun challenge (though a little simple) but the majority of puzzles you find in the world are the Korok seed challenges, these are often repetitive and overly simple.The game has plenty of good ideas which it executes well, but the bad drags it down a little bit. I'd still recommend it but it wont be everyone's cup of tea.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,12,2017,Royaume-Uni
My first experience playing Zelda was on the Nintendo 64 with Ocarina of time. For any real Zelda fan this is a must buy. For any adventure game fan this is also a must buy. Breath of the Wild is one of those very few games in the past couple of years that has really tried to innovate it's games design and in doing so created a very fun and enjoyable game that tells a very fresh tale about Link in a vast open world game. This is a living and breathing world you explore battling a large number of interesting enemies and picking up upgrades for Link aswell as new weapons to keep the combat interesting. The game alone is stunning and for a console that is able to be played in handheld mode your going to be putting ALOT of hours in to this one. Do yourself a favour and pick up the absolute marvel of an experience you will not be disappointed.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,12,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Great game for the switch, looks as good on the big as on the small screen. The graphics aren‚Äôt as rich or vivid as I remember from games such as the ocarina of time, but I think that‚Äôs intentional to fit with the story line.

"Absolutely stunning game. Not at all disappointed. Have been playing Zelda games since the gameboy and SNES versions came out. It's evolved into a beautiful game with even more depth.I'm liking the temples as they're short and you don't end up in them for days.The ability to get fairly big items that you used to get further into the game (like bombs, bows and other powers) is really great as it opens up the whole thing.Really enjoying the size of the game without being too bombarded by annoying characters or gimmicks (like the irritating time demands of Majora's Mask). Feels like you can explore far more than previous Zelda games.So whilst I'm probably not very far into the game given the size of it - I think this is by far the best Zelda game yet.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This was my first game for the Switch and it's looking good. Only just starting so a long way to go.There are a lot of controls to learn/remember and there were NO instructions included with the game. There was an empty clip in the case that held the game card, so I contacted Nintendo support and asked about the ""missing"" instruction booklet.They told me that they didn't provide a booklet!

Can't wait until I have more spare time to play this - I literally had to make myself leave this at home before heading to work today!This game is vast - I shall certainly be taking my time to explore everywhere.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
Excellent but overrated. Discovering new areas is wonderful fun but most temples are repetitive and unexciting. Combat is too easy and dull. Without the expansion packs replay value is limited.

"I bought this at launch as all the trailers had looked good and I needed a good game to play at launch. The best way to think about this game is it is a Nintendo take on Skyrim. Hyrule is a vast, beautiful interesting world full of interesting areas (icy mountains, hot deserts, luscious jungle) and quirky characters. The world is the main reason for playing as well as the journey from a week link to getting the Master Sword and of course defeating the Evil Ganon. Overall the story is ok but the people meet, the areas you go and the mechanics are simply superb.In short if you have a switch or are an open world fan this game is simply a must play!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,4,2018,Royaume-Uni

"The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild is the first true open world game in the Zelda series. Nintendo's main goal at the beginning was to evolve the series and honestly, they couldn't have done a better job. On Nintendo Switch the game runs at 900p on the TV and 720p in handheld mode. The gameplay is magnificent and the story, characters, graphics and the physics engine really enhances the experience. If you have played any of the games in the series I highly suggest you play this game and if you're new to the series you should do the same, because honestly this game is a true masterpiece. Only minor complaint would be the fact there's not as many dungeons as past Zelda games and the final boss is a joke, but that still doesn't effect my perfect score",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,4,2017,Royaume-Uni

Loads of adventures, quests, battles, puzzles... this game has so much to do, you can play for as little or as long as you want. Highly recommend to both hard core gamers and those like me who never game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,5,2020,Royaume-Uni
This is one of the greatest games I've ever played.  Beautiful artwork and animation. Unbelievably gorgeous music.  Intriguing puzzles and a dynamic that allows the player to be motivated to keep exploring and become part of the adventurous legend and story.  Five Stars ...it deserves nothing less.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Holy God this game is fantastic, and its not a walk in the park either. What sets tihs from other Zelda games and most games today is the lack of tuturial at the beginning of the game. You walk out only knowing the very basics which you have to find out ot get out, and the rest you explore to find out, experiment etc and it makes for a whole new challenge, but its fantastic. If you want you can walk to the final boss as soon as you start the game, thats how open it is, but you wont win, but you can try.Anyone who has a switch must have this, or be insane not to have this, this is the only reason to own a switch at this point",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Literally the best game I‚Äôve ever played (other than oddworld), love that it‚Äôs open world so endless fun. You have plenty of tasks to do but you can freely travel around by foot, horse or glider (still early days in the game). So much fun! Delivered super quick as well, thanks!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
Amazing game for everyone that loves a good open world game. The graphics are astonishing and the soundtrack is perfect for all the different scenarios. The only thing that I didnt enjoy is the fact that you can't craft items.Really recommend it!,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,10,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Ordered this for my 8yr old son.The game was ¬£60 with Nintendo online, but ¬£45 to ¬£47 for the physical cartridge with most retailers. Thought this was poor form from Nintendo as we wanted the download version.Ordered from Amazon for ¬£45. Case arrived and when my son opened it there was no cartridge present. He was so upset, I went and paid ¬£47 for the game at Argos and later sent the empty case back to Amazon.Great service as usual from Amazon when dealing with the return.Poor experience from Nintendo for their dubious online pricing and sending empty cases.For the game itself  my son loves it.We will be buying all games in store in future and checking the case before leaving the shop.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,6,2022,Royaume-Uni

"Although I bought this product ""NEW"" there was a slit in the plastic wrap and when my partner opened it for Christmas the game cartridge was missing and he noticed the inside of the game box was scratched up where someone had shoved something inside to pop the game cartridge out. Either I was lied to and this product was not ""NEW"" or someone in the distribution warehouse got a free game at my expense.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2022,√âtats-Unis

"I have been a Zelda fan for a long time. My favourite was ocarina of time and love all the others afterwards. Skyward sword came close to being my favorite but just missed. This however is by far the best entry in the series and has become my favorite and the best game available on the switch. It is a must have, it introduces a massive open world that you will literally spend ages admiring and taking selfies with your shekia slate. Story is great, full voice acting is very good as Zelda and other characters have full voiced dialogue for some scenes. Can't give the game enough praise, if you have a switch it is a must have.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I am still playing this game since I bought it a few months ago, and would highly recommend it to those who have and haven't played Zelda before.There's so much stuff to do in this game, and you don't even have to play the main questline until you want to! I've already invested many hours into it, and still haven't discovered everything! The graphics, music, animation and SFX are stunning!You need to pick this game up if you haven't already!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,7,2019,Royaume-Uni

"the game it the best zelda game to date and i have played every one the amount of freedom and movement that you are given in just amazing, you will find yourself just getting immersed in the gaming world for hours on end the climbing mechanic i would say it fun you can literally mountain climb  and also paraglide around this gigantic open world and it is one of the biggest open world games i have played and i play a lot of sand box open world games.if you like open world games you will most probably like this game the art style is also really pleasing to the eye and plays will in handheld mode and on the TV.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I‚Äôm sad to say today was the day I completed Zelda. Loved every minute! Still got loads of side quests and shrines to do, but I‚Äôve saved Zelda and now I feel like everything is over! Map is huge, loads of little villages to conquer aswell as fairy fountains, labs and of course the great Deku tree! I‚Äôve currently got around 110 hours game play but this could easily be double. Pretty damn addictive too, so if your a student like me with assignments I‚Äôd advise waiting for the summer!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Bought this for the hysband for his birthday. Hes been ranting on about getting it since it released, but wanted to wait for the price to go down... well, it wasnt going to this side of the decade, so i bit the bullet.By the sounds of things this game is a good mash of modern game play and nostalgia. Though i cant say much else cos hes been playing it almost constantly during down time. It must be good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,7,2019,Royaume-Uni
"(NO SPOILERS) This must be one of the best games I have ever played. It's so much fun. There is just so much to do, the world is MASSIVE, the graphics are gorgeous and music is fantastic. I didn't buy this right away because a friend of mine didn't find the breakable weapons a fun mechanic but I for one think it's a welcome change. I just wish we could carry more weapons though because there are so many cool weapons in the game.It's one of those games that will also make the time fly. Sometimes I'll just be 'that area down there looks interesting', 2 hours later I'm still exploring it. Highly recommended.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,10,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Definitely the best Zelda ever! I have now played it for a week and I find it difficult to put it down. There is so much to explore and do, I don't get bored. It is a different concept from what we are used to with the former Zelda games but the improvement is fantastic. I particularly like the open world, the fact that you can explore so much and you can tackle the game in any way you want to. I am thoroughly impressed and can't recommend it enough. Also, although expensive, because it is so massive, I will have hours and hours of play so worth the money. A word about Amazon service: it was great, as always. Thank you!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Less reviews than I would have expected; I think everyone has been too busy playing it to write reviews!Truly an amazing game.  Vast, rich, and detailed.  It's a good progression of the Zelda series; it has changed a few of the fundamental mechanics of the game, but in very clever and well thought out ways, and without losing it's identity as a Zelda game.  I've personally never been as much of a fan of Zelda fan as Nintendo's other franchises, but this release has changed that for me, and is one of my favourite games I've ever played.  And as a bonus, it's so big, I'll be playing it for some time to come...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"I've never been a big fan of Zelda games (I've tried Ocarina. Wind Waker. Twilight Princess and the DS ones but never clicked with them) but decided to grab this after the overwhelmingly positive reviews.After a week of solid play I can honestly agree it is a wonderful game.  The balance of story, of exploration, of puzzling, of combat in a huge and beautiful world is hugely engrossing.The game starts with a fantastic self contained area that introduces the mechanics of the game whilst drawing you before you finally see the real scale of the world and story revealed.  It's a brilliant game and it looks fantastic.  Easily recommended.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Ein MUSS f√ºr jeden ZELDA-Fan! Am Anfang war ich skeptisch. Nur kleine Dugeons, daf√ºr aber 120 St√ºck (!), open world und die Grafik wirkte, als h√§tte jemand die Figuren woanders ausgeschnitten und in das Spiel eingef√ºgt. Aber nach den ersten 20 Minuten spielen wirkte alles stimmig und machte riesen Spa√ü. Das Spiel bietet viele M√∂glichkeiten , ohne dabei zu √ºberfrachten, ist sehr detailreich und im Gesamten sehr episch!W√ºrde mir f√ºr zuk√ºnftige Zelda-Spiele w√ºnschen, dass man es mal zu zweit spielen k√∂nnte (z. B.: einer Link, einer Zelda oder Darunia).Eine absolute Kaufempfehlung f√ºr jeden, der eine Switch besitzt.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2019,Allemagne
"Absolutely adore this game. The primary reason I bought the Switch in the first place was because I'd heard so many good things about this game and I was not disappointed. While dropping this much on a game may put some people off, if I had to give one reason for anyone to buy a Switch, it would be to have the chance to play this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Probably the best game I have ever played. Manages to feel nostalgic and have the feel of the old Zelda games (Ocarina of Time, A Link to the Past) while feeling completely new and polished. It's completely absorbing, really fun to play, truly open world where you can practically impact and affect all of the world around you. I'm on 200+ hours and I'm still excited to go home and play it every day. I have other consoles that I had for 5+ years that have not released a game that comes close to this. The ¬£300 spent on the console and the game was some of the best money I've ever spent. Real masterpiece.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,5,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Da amante di Zelda e Nintendo in generale ero timoroso per questa virata ""open world"". Invece Nintendo ha di nuovo fatto la scelta giusta al momento giusto. Forse ne risente lievemente la storia ma allo stesso tempo non si poteva mantenere i toni dei vecchi Zelda con una realizzazione cos√¨ in grande. Giocabilit√†, fisica, ambientazioni, colori tutto √® perfetto, e quando si va a regime il gioco crea una piacevole dipendenza mai invasiva. voto 9/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,3,2020,Italie
"Best game I've played in a long time so far and makes me very glad I've bought a switch.I've barely made a dent in completing the main story so far and I keep getting distracted by the incredibly well designed and intriguing world they've built. I'm very pleased about the aesthetics, the way they've opted for less music and more rich game audio like wind rustling the leaves, bird song, always changing weather.There are animals scurrying around everywhere, secrets hidden all over the place. It's an utter delight, the world feels so alive and they've even got the difficulty spot on. I'm going to sink a huge number of hours into this I can tell!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This is one of the best game's I have played on the switch or even the Nintendo as a whole. Ever. This was the whole reason I decided to get a switch so I wasn't disappointed at all. I love games that have an open world feel to them such as The Witcher and skyrim and this game reminded me of these. Whilst the story and characters are not as in depth as these games, the landscape is still beautiful to gallop around. I have spent hours hunting fish and animals in the woodland and really enjoy saving up money! I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who asks!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I'm a 30 year old who grew up with a GameBoy/N64 and GBA/GameCube, playing anything you care to name on each console.Since then, I played about 5 games: Halo 2, WoW, Halo 3, SC2, and LoL. I thought single player gaming was a thing of the past for me.Breath of the Wild is something wonderful. I very nearly sent the Switch back as I was not accustomed to loading times (which are really not that long, and only when travelling between shrines) nor was I convinced this game was worth the price of the console alone.About 2 hours later and I was in love with the best game I've played, certainly in a generation, probably ever.Worth the price of the console alone. Buy it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Fantastic game with many hours of exploration alone. As a completionist this game is taking a while to find every hidden secret, the graphics are beautiful (I have taken so many screen grabs of simple scenery!) and mechanics are very cool. Controls are easy to get used to and can be played so casually people of any level of gaming experience can enjoy it. A wonderful addition to the Zelda franchise.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,9,2019,Royaume-Uni
Played this game for awhile now and I am not seeing the hype. I will say the game is incredibly well designed and the visuals are top notch. Unfortunately the gameplay doesn‚Äôt work for me. The vast open world while impressive feels tedious to me. Non linear gameplay often leaves me walking aimlessly around and often end up in a place I probably wasn‚Äôt meant to be in until later in the game. I thoroughly dislike the durability system. Weapons seem programmed to break at the worst possible time leaving certain death a possibility. The game does give you a lot weapons but most of them are pretty useless and don't kill anything. I find myself hesitant to play this game purely because I find it tedious and more often than not frustrating. It is a shame such an impressive game fails so badly in the enjoyment side of things.,2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,2,2021,Royaume-Uni
Good game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Totally open world, do whatever you want, in any order you want, explore everything, there is virtually nothing on this gigantic map that cannot be reached in some way by Link.Nintendo have surpassed ALL expectations for the Zelda franchise, and for the better.There have been some changes to the game such as the way you collect rupees, how you gain and utilise weapons and how you recover health and stamina.The graphics are beyond anything experienced in zelda before, when you look to the horizon you see all the landscape in great detail.Five stars doesn't really do this title justice, all Zelda fans will fall in love with this latest incarnation.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"The imagination on offer here is just ridiculous.  Finally, a game that doesn't hold your hand, tell you what to do or where to go or how to play.Once you get out of the first area and into the main world, which is HUGE!!, then it's up to you.Being able to follow the story at my own pace and really just enjoy and explore the rich world Nintendo have created is a Godsend.Also, be prepared to get your ass kicked a lot and by everything because this game can be tough.  Given the chance, monsters will kill you with one hit.  You will burn, drown, freeze, be crushed, fall, get electrocuted, stomped, kicked, blown up.....omg!!  You'll never starve though, there's always something to eat!A true pinnacle gaming experience.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"A triple AAA title that didn't disappoint, offers so much content that will leave players days on end to finish all events, side mission and main story.Has even got DLCs if you want more to experience the game fully although paid separately.This title is a must have on the switch!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,6,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Been a fan of Zelda games for many years but not had the most recent Nintendo consoles, preferring instead an XBOX One and GameCube/Dreamcast/PS2. I have to say this has opened my eyes back up to what Nintendo are capable of.It's unmistakably Zelda but with little elements of Shadow of the Colossus and Portal added in in terms of mechanic and feel.The visuals are sublime and the sense of pace and your surroundings are wonderful. The controls are fantastic as well and really shows what the Switch can do.Be prepared to charge your Switch a lot as you won't be able to put this down!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,10,2017,Royaume-Uni
Fantastic take on the classic Zelda formula. Makes the leap to an open world setting while remaining faithful to its roots. Great for long term fans as well as newcomers to the series,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Product arrived on time and was in perfect condition. The game is as fun as you no doubt have read from day of release plenty to do with hundreds of hours of content. No need to rush the story take your time to explore and familiarise yourself with the world and enemies you meet. Experiment and play, the fun you will have will be the reward long before you step foot into the more challenging and rewarding aspects of the game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
Fantastic game once you get used to the new Nintendo switch controllers. Works and plays great. I've played every version of a Zelda game since the NES and this holds up. It's a massive expensive game with great graphics. If you wish to play this without the motion controls and play and a standard game then you can turn off the motion controls and the pro controller or the joycons are great. Not worry about reports about battery life if your playing just with the tv. I've only run the joycons flat once in a week of player. This is a must have game. Any questions just ask,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Probably the best game available on the switch currently, but of a change from previous Zelda games with it‚Äôs more free roaming feel, the map is huge with lots of great things and places to find. The story is gripping and visually the game is stunning, many hours of truly immersive gameplay to be had.A must play title for the switch.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Game of the year? Game of the decade? ...or quite possibly... Game of the century!Believe all the reviews because nothing can prepare you for the experience that is... Legend of Zelda - Breath of the Wild.A staggering achievement in game design, artistry and imagination that you will not want to ever stop playing... absolutely mindblowing!((I love how Nintendo always give guidelines for playing thier games like taking a break after a couple of hours play to kind of give your self a rest... thing is though, with a game like this its damn near impossible to put down. Ive been playing it for two weeks now since its release and it just keeps getting better and better... it really could be 'the best game of all time'! ))",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
My boys love this game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2021,Royaume-Uni
"It's like the best parts of all the best games I've ever played. Haven't seen a world so vast and sumptuous since Red Dead or skyrim. It's such a pleasure to travel around (ability to climb makes you feel like you're never being boxed into a trail by the devs). Sneaking up on camps and figuring out strategies to attack, reminds me of Far Cry 3. The puzzles are as good as those in Portal. It's just got layer upon layer of detail, surprises and ingenuity. The last time i felt so thoroughly entranced by a video game was maybe Super Mario World on the SNES.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,7,2017,Royaume-Uni
Absolutely breth taking! I love it. There is so much to do in it and the enimys are diverse. the  puzzles: challenging but not frustrating the game give you the opportunity to exsplore if you choose to do so.

"This game is truly a masterpiece. It offers hours and hours of gameplay with a great story line and lots of replay value. If you're a Zelda fan then there will be things that might annoy you such as weapons that break and no real massive dungeons. But I'm between the empty landscape you'll find a colourful and vibrant town environments. I hope in the next game they go back to solve of the grass roots..

"I'm completely wowed by Zelda: Breath of the Wild as it exceeded my expectations completely and in terms of gameplay and graphics, it's utterly fantastic! I've been playing the game for several hours on end but not for the main missions, no, it was to explore the map, go anyone where I'd want and then do side-missions.I know it may seem silly to not focus on the main missions but considering there's so much to do, you're left with so many choices you just don't know which one to pick! :PNintendo made the best Zelda to date and no one can deny it!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"The game can be difficult for some but is the best Zelda in the series and a benchmark for any open world AAA game.  The story, the characters, all the world items, the music and the gameplay are all fantastic.  Nintendo took their time and put a lot of work into this and it paid off. It is no wonder why (they say) they sold more of this game then Switch consoles itself.  A must for a Switch console owner unless the console is used only by the very young or solely for local multiplayer.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,8,2017,Royaume-Uni
"A massive world to explore.Every single item moves or reacts with how you interact with it.Just going up to a tree or cliff and being able to climb it, wandering through grasses where stalks ripple and move.Then add in the intuitive , dynamic , exciting familiar and new gameplay and you lose yourself in this amazing game.New concepts of weapons and armour with number of times they can be used, making elixirs and foods , from countless ingredients is the right way for the series to evolve.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,4,2018,Royaume-Uni

Fantastic game.  I haven't had this much fun since the Ocarina of Time when I was a kid.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,2,11,2020,√âtats-Unis

"This game has delivered in all aspects. The game is beyond anything you will have ever played before and trying to go back to a game like Witcher, Horizon Zero Dawn or any other open world game will be tough. The freedom of exploration, combat, upgrades and many hidden secrets will have you engrossed for hours 100 + hours in and im still engrossed. Even if you do end up completing this game, there's always something else to do and find. If you haven't bought this when you buy a Ninetendo switch.. then your missing out on something truly special.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
One of the greatest video games of all time.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,8,2021,Royaume-Uni
Been a playstation devotee for years but bought this for my wife to go with the Switch I bought her. We find ourselves wrestling fir the controller for this one though.Probably one of the all time top games ibe ever played and I've been playing (don't judge me) since the late 80s,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
They did a fantastic job with this game! We love it!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I don't need to say anything, you coming here means you already bought the game and wanted to see what people say, and i have a lot.This game? This bad boy? This? This is no question the high quality content, beautiful graphics, open world to the extreme, amazing combat, amazing story, and all around great fun. Played over 80 hours and i still didn't fight the boss, because i still have quite a bit that can still be done.If you ever held a controller, you must play this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Fantastic game, I brought this to replace a copy that got lost. I have spent hundreds of hours in this game and plan to spend many more roaming Hyrule.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2021,Royaume-Uni

"It's the game of the year for a reason - I've loved Zelda games since I was a boy in the 90s. The only downside to this game is that all weapons break so quickly. Combat can be a bit tedious because of this, if you'd rather hack and slash than use your slate you might find yourself feeling like I do. That said, this game is beautiful. Stunning music, funny interactions with enemies and a very immersive story (albeit a little anime-esque).",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,12,2017,Royaume-Uni

Just buy this game. Thank me later,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,8,2021,Inde
"Even a year after release, this game is still fantastic. The fact that you can play it on the go on the Switch version is the icing on the cake.It's a pretty big departure from other Zelda games, with the the fact that your weapons will break and there's a stamina meter (like there was in Skyward Sword).Instead of dungeons there's Shrines instead which is a nice way to shake things up a bit to the old tried and tested formula.Definitely worth the purchase.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Having played Zelda for as long as I can remember and having played and replayed the majority of the Zelda games (except one or two of the Gameboy/DS ones), I can confirm that this newest edition is far from a let down, it is (and I never thought I would say it) incredible and even rivals ocarina of time. Definitely worth the money. The graphics and scenery are amazing and the open world is so smooth and flawless - no buffering.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,9,2018,Royaume-Uni
Brilliant game so much to explore so much to do it's a must have for any nintendo switch owner,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,5,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Best game I've played in ages.  Being able to play this on the move (bus/train) is great, and the Switch as a console allowing you to pick it up and be back in the game in seconds, with no loading time, is fantastic.  I've been playing this for a couple of weeks now and feel like I've still got a long way to go.  A wonderful new experience in Hyrule, which I've not enjoyed so much since The Ocarina of Time on the N64",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,3,2018,Royaume-Uni

Honestly the best game ever created! Played over 172h on it and still not even clsoe finishing it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,5,2021,Royaume-Uni
"New to the switch, So far I like it",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I die A LOT in this game but still it's fun. I normally don't like super hard games and couldn't play Zelda Ocarina of Time nicely without a walkthrough, but since this BotW is an open world game you don't have to 'figure the game out'. I've been fine (and enjoying it a lot) playing mostly on my own so far. Sometimes have to look things up. Buttons controls were designed nicely not hard to remember like many other games. Zelda fan or 'experienced' gamers or beginners don't matter you'll have fun saving the princess!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,4,2017,Royaume-Uni

It is great adventure game with awsome weapons.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
The best Game ever made. It does not need lengthy reviews. Its just the best game in the history of any consoles. I have a PS4 i had an xbox one. They can not touch this. Nintendo are now and in my opinion are on another level  !!! The only game I would compare it to in regards to love effort and detail put into a tittle would be metal gear solid by Kojima. And i bet even he is sitting right now playing and enjoying this too. And thats the thing it is such an enjoyable game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This game, to me, is the pinnacle of fantasy adventure games, it is great at introducing the series to newcomers, whilst containing throwbacks and elements that satisfy vetrans, all done with a fairly big gameplay change compared to previous games which I think works very well here. Definitely one to at least try.Also the game is abundant and thus wont take long to be delivered.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I absolutely LOVE this game. I bought it on Wednesday and have probably clocked up over 24 hours of gameplay, even with a 9-5:30 job.The first scene after seeing the landscape for the first time is epic.I've never been more excited for a game before, so much so that I do not skip any of the cut scenes. It adds so much to the story line.The only criticism I can have is the loading times between travelling and restarting after dying, but it's such a minor criticism.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2017,Royaume-Uni

The best game on the Nintendo switch. If you only buy 1 game get this one!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,5,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Sure, this game has some technical flaws but that hasn't stopped me pouring over 90 hours into it. The world is full of life, mystery and interesting characters. The best thing about this is that it lets go out of your hand the moment you start, you are free to explore to your hearts content - see that mountain WAY in the distance, find a horse and you can get to the top of it.I skipped the last Zelda game and really hope no one skips this, it's perfect.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
Great game it arrived earlier than expected I've been playing for a couple hours and it's easy to get in to and have fun in,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,12,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Great game. Have been playing a lot since the release, and I have kept uncovering secrets. This is easily the best Zelda game, and they have embraced the open world element. The dungeons being puzzles is a nice twist. At first I preferred skyrim and witcher with their high-fantasy and more adult feel, but this is a real masterpiece with excellent physics and a realistic world feel that drags you in bit by bit. The fact you can play this on the bus is even more amazing! Maybe the best game ever?",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
Great game. Easy to play,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
"I found the world empty and lacking any meaningful side content, the combat can't hold a candle to Dark Souls, the story was almost non existent and I think the characters were mind-numbingly boring. One of the only things this game did well in my opinion was the exploration which, while very fun, did not manage to make the game interesting for me at all, as I felt no drive to explore the world past the required amount. Even the exploration felt very formulaic, with the climbing of vistas to reveal more of the map and the exploration of shrines to improve your character. By the end of the game I found myself rushing into the final level (Hyrule Castle) to beat the boss and be done, only to be disappointed once again, by an unimaginative and easy boss fight and absolutely no post end content, which I think this game would have really benefited from.I imagine if my expectations were not as high going into the game, I may have found more redeeming qualities in it, however, I feel like Nintendo focused too heavily on the engine which, besides the exploration, was the only other part of the game I enjoyed. Now that I am finally done with this game I find myself wishing I spent my money on something else, and returning to games which I think had much more interesting content and higher replay value.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,4,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Magico. Estasiante. Sublime. Chiunque finirebbe gli aggettivi e le parole di fronte a tale maestria e sopraffina tecnica nel mettere insieme un gioco cos√≠ maestoso e imponente nella sua bellezza.

"The game is fun and beautiful. I was impressed by its size. But for me it's a 4 out of 5 because I wasn't connected to the story at all. It was just me though, I can totally understand other people. The game is really good and polished. Definetly a must buy for the fans! Nice one Nintendo!",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,10,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Breath of the Wild is an epic, open-world adventure. Graphics and gameplay are incredible, with many areas to explore, and tasks to complete.As my first Legend of Zelda game, this was an exceptional beginning into the series. New players not familiar with the series will not experience great difficulty in getting into the game, whilst those more familiar will enjoy references to older titles.Breath of the Wild offers an exciting world to explore with breathtaking landscapes and hours of entertainment.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,8,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Play. This. Game.I'm new to Zelda, but had to pick this up after watching my boyfriend playing it.It's gorgeous; huge, expansive open world where you can literally interact with everything. Climb mountains, swim in lakes, climb trees, sail, fish, build, cook, hunt, fly, fight, puzzles, magic... It's incredible. The designers have built the most incredibly immersive, beautiful game I've ever played and everyone should play it!It took me about 5/6 hours of playing to get a hang of the full controls. A minor 2pts off a 100,000pt game though; just power through and enjoy your new life. üòÅ",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2018,Royaume-Uni

Normally i don't write reviews but for this game i couldn't help it!I bought this game for my switch and have played it for endless fu for a couple of weeks. With endless replay ability you can play for hours and make little game progress OR you can  play for hours and make tons of progress.First Zelda game i have ever played and i would rate it 10/10 for sure !Best switch game i have ever played,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,12,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I love everything about this game except the price, as a Nintendo product it can never get 5 stars for that reason. The game is packed with content, the mechanics and controls are solid, the story is classic and it just feels wholesome and satisfying.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,4,2019,Royaume-Uni
It's ok I guess,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,2,2021,√âtats-Unis
"There are good and bad stuff about this game, for me a university student it doesn't really interest me. Its a huge open world but... there isn‚Äôt much action in the game. Lots of the same monsters and same battles over and over. While there is adventure and a huge beautiful world, its kind of a wasteland and not much action.It isn‚Äôt all doom but for me, paying ¬£48 for a video game it HAS to be fantastic. The high reviews and eatings for this game make it seem the best there is for the Switch but it isn‚Äôt. It is okay but not THIS good not worth the price. Its worth ¬£20 but no more than that.Kids might enjoy it and it might be suitable for them but if you like action-adventure save your money and get another game. This game will be ending up on eBay tonight because it just isn‚Äôt worth the money and no action in the game, just same monsters over and over in a huge wasteland. This just destroys the opportunity for it to be a fantastic game.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,7,2020,Royaume-Uni

I've played ocarina and a few other games but never quite fell in love with the zelda series. However this game is absolutely mindblowing. Best experience I've ever had with a game in my life.

"This new installment of The Legend of Zelda is the best to every exist. Botw is absolutely beautiful to look at and it runs amazingly on the Nintendo Switch, however the harsh environments are quite hard to get through especially cold ones because unless you're wearing the proper amount of clothes you're done for. But this is just too good to not give 5 stars and I hope they continue making Zelda games like this one.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2018,Royaume-Uni

Was never a big zelda fan but having a switch and everyone saying this is the best game for it and it has changed my mind this game is incredible spent alot more hours on it than I expected mainly thanks to the switch being so convenient playing this over a friends is an easy task and the look of the game is greatvon portable and on the tv can not rate this game high enough,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,1,2018,Royaume-Uni

Even my wife (sad as this seems) enjoys sitting and watching us play and occasionally checking google for cheats and tips, to help us out.  Worth buying the Nintendo Switch just to play it.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2019,Royaume-Uni

"I‚Äôve been playing video games for 30+ years and this is one of the very best I‚Äôve ever played. In fact it‚Äôs not a game but an experience. I love being able to just explore and discover new things. Difficulty level is just about right too.Edit/Update: still playing, appears my nine year old loves this game even more than I do. Together we've explored, solved puzzles and defeated bosses. Probably the best game I've ever played.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,11,2017,Royaume-Uni

"This is a great game. Absolutely love the game play, attention to detail, complexity and storytelling. It's not Ocarina of Time - let's be clear about that, but it is a modern day masterpiece that alone justifies buying the Switch. I would not recommend this for young children, mainly because of the difficulty of the game. There is no linearity to it, and you're left to explore the vast world at your leisure (and sometimes annoyance when you're lost). Highly recommended!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Previously played 10 minutes of a Zelda game (wind waker) so I wouldn't say I knew much about the history.I was quite sceptical about the claims being made about this game and was looking forward to picking this apart, assuming the rave reviews were based solely on its cosmetics.However, I have to marvel at the engineering, innovation, and quality that's effectively raised the bar on what people will accept from this type of genre from here on in.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,4,2017,Royaume-Uni

"WOW, now this is what I call a cracking game, full of everything you need in a game, proper full world exploration. Hopefully game designers and  writers will realise THIS is what we want. Remember people it is not graphics in a game that wins, it's gameplay, game design and playability, And this will astound you, in every direction, a must purchase.

Perhaps Amazon should avoid inviting ratings from the purchasers of products clearly intended as gifts for small children?",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,2,2019,Royaume-Uni
Christmas gift. Hope he enjoys it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2020,√âtats-Unis
Love this game. Almost too much content. It arrived on time and perfect.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,7,2020,√âtats-Unis
Good,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
I love this game.. I'm glad I got it back again.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
I bought this as a gift . The recipient seems quite happy with it .,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2021,Royaume-Uni
One of the best games out there for the switch!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
"I loved this initially but then I ended up getting a bit frustrated by all the things felt I *should* complete and it started to feel a bit repetitive and frustrating... I can see a lot of love as gone into this game and I think I'll have to come back to it one day but, sadly for now, it's not for me.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2018,Royaume-Uni
"It's a open world game,with a large amount of quests and lots of detail. Hours of game play to explore . Even if you're not a big Zelda fan, I really recommend this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,2,2020,Royaume-Uni
Lives up to the hype. Huge game with so many different fun quests and a gorgeous map. Exploring alone is tons of fun and general gameplay is better than a lot of RPGS. Can't recommend it enough,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
Great game so absorbing. Graphics are great and the sound affects first class. The monsters are really big and powerful. The weapons break after about 3 strikes unfortunately and I am hoping they get more powerful as the game progresses. Better to try and avoid a lot of the monsters they are so strong. It is a whole new experience for the Zelda games. Wonderful game wonderful graphics so much detail it is like a movie.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
Grandson loves it.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
Hours of fun,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2021,√âtats-Unis
daughter was very happy with this. they play it on their switch lite,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,12,2020,Royaume-Uni
"This really is by far one of if not the best game on the market and the next evolution of open world games. With the freedom to go anywhere and do anything without any hand holding or boundaries. Climb every mountain, cut down every tree, take a ride on every animal or go straight from the starting point to the end boss there are no limits and no other game that compares to it",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Great game, open world, exploration, combat, missions, the works, just a little slow to get into. If you like me, have ADHD & the attention span of a gold fish it‚Äôs probably gonna be one of those you pick up and play in bursts. Nonetheless, beautiful graphics.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,25,11,2018,Royaume-Uni
"This game is huge, I can't emphasise the scope of the world enough. The art style is simple and charming. Gameplay is just challenging enough so that it doesn't feel easy but it never gets boring. This game has the addictive quality of some of the earlier FF games",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,6,2019,Royaume-Uni
Grandaughter loved it,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,6,2021,Royaume-Uni
Follows on from previous Zelda games so excellent. I didn't have Wii U so don't know if it's this game that changed but I can carry unlimited arrows and money etc. I love the fact that I can buy and sell things off other characters in the game. I've been doing the side quests as well so that adds a little time to the game. Got a feeling I've almost completed it though üò¢,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
It‚Äôs an artistically beautiful game and the playing of it is incredibly fun. Play time goes beyond 100 hours if you wish it to. There are tons of things to do,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,3,2020,Royaume-Uni
Great game after nearly 3 years it still holds up and I loved it. First legend of Zelda game I've played and I want to go back and play the rest in the series,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I've been playing games for 30 years and I rarely write reviews, but after a day this honestly feels like it might be the best game I've played. It's definitely Zelda, but it seems the guys at Nintendo have very smartly adopted some of the more western open world techniques too. The game is VAST. And I mean big, but around every corner you will find secrets and surprises you expect from the franchise. The polish is outstanding. To hell with writing long reviews I gotta go play this game.Ps: Switch is a winner",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"If you're thinking about getting it but you're not sure then take the leap and order it, you won't regret it.The game as a whole is very open world, there's a story line but you don't have to follow it, the world of Hyrule is yours to explore.A fantastic start to the Nintendo Switch line-up and I can't wait for the next one.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
"I once played  a Zelda game on the original game boy, i didn't really enjoy it and gave up quite quickly.This game on the switch is amazing. I love the open gameplay and have spent hours just wandering around exploring. Lots of things to do - side quests, shrine quests, divine beasts & main quests. I've had hours of gameplay, it's really earned the money I've spent on the game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,6,2017,Royaume-Uni
"A true master piece. Having played most of the other Zelda titles over the years this one has managed something very special in usurping the other s in practically every way. Looking at the title from a player who is not familiar with the series is equally as special as the world is so immersive, so magical and so engrossing that it will not matter in the slightest. A must play for all gamers. 10/10",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"For me it is very disappointing to see the Zelda series go down the survival game path. It looks and sounds like Zelda but plays like your bog standard survival game. This kind of gameplay really undermines Link as a 'hero'. Instead it feels like your some incompetent  man constantly 'fire fighting' to replenish his broken or depleted stockI was especially loathed when I found out this game requires you to micro manage Links body temperature. There are items, food or clothing to help with this but you have to constantly watch your stats and switch equipment which sucks out all the fun from the game.The worst part is the speed weapons degrade. You have to keep breaking combat to manage this. Eventually you will start avoiding combat as the reward will not be worth the cost of breaking your best weapons only to be replaced by rubbish clubs and spears. This is a complete oversight and should have been realised during the play test phase.As you can tell from this review I am not a fan of tedious survival games. It is good how Nintendo are trying new genres but they should have done this with a new IP rather than defacing a series like Zelda.The trials can be fun but are very short and generally very easy. It's just a real shame about the bits in between them.Do not buy into the hype. If you like frequent micro managing and pausing games during the action then you will love this. For me I prefer the fluidity of games like Nioh, Nier, Horizon or the more tradition Zelda games.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"functions fine but arrived with scribble all over the cartridge, I expected better paying ¬£45 for a Nintendo game (from Amazon Warehouse or not!)",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2022,Royaume-Uni
"Before I bought 'The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild' I had never played a Zelda game in my life. The only reason I bought this was because the other switch launch titled looked absolutely terrible! The storyline has lots of depth, the world/map is huge and the game play mechanics are simply amazing! The only problem is, this game is certain to take up at least 100 hours of your life!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This game is by far the best game I have ever played. The shesr size and replay value of the game can have you spend hundreds of hours without getting bored. This is the biggest reason why its better than mario odyssey as that game is good but extremely short. So considering the price of the game, you get way more worth of content",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,5,2018,Royaume-Uni
Wow. What a game. I absolutely love it!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,2,2021,Royaume-Uni
What can I say about this game? If I could give it more stars I would. Without question it is one of the finest games ever produced. I would go as far as to say it is the BEST game ever made and that's quite some claim.I ahave spent countless hours exploring Hyrule and am still nowhere near completing it. Absolutely HUGE map! Buy this game!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Wonderful experience playing Breath of the Wild. I completed all the shrines, the four dungeons, memories and stormed Hyrule Castle and I have no complaints on money well spent. DLC will be a must , though it is probably best to revisit with that towards the end of the year when you can get both downloads from Nintendo. This is just a special gaming experience and if buying a Switch this is the must buy game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"I myself personally never played this game, but my kids love to play it on the Switch.... I love to watch them playing it and same time they explain all what they are doing in the game...  Definitely a must have for the Switch! Too bad it is not available on the PS4...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Really good game if you love Zelda, the weapons breaking alot is annoying but don't let it put you off. The shrines are challenging at times and the world is beautiful",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,2,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Link really needs to learn to take better care of his swords.They have this annoying habit of shattering like mechanical pencil refills.Anyway... it is a fun game, despite a few weird and annoying draw-backs... like the fragile weapons... and the fandom arguments over which LoZ timeline it fits into.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,1,8,2018,Royaume-Uni
This may just be my favourite game of all time. Nintendo have crafted a game that truly allows you to interact with everything and go wherever you like at any time.There is so much content here and the game offers something for everyone to enjoy.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,6,2019,Royaume-Uni

excellent!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,6,2021,Royaume-Uni
"A beautiful game. Possibly the best Zelda yet. Certainly the best game I have had the pleasure to play since Super Mario Galaxy back on the Wii. Still playing it after over 100 hours, and still enjoying all the little secrets and encounters hidden around the map. I could write paragraphs expousing how great this game is, but it has all been said already in other places.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,8,2017,Royaume-Uni
Brilliant game. Very quick delivery.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
There are no words for how awesome this game is.  I was terrified to buy any other game for the switch as its tyrant good i though everything else would suck by comparison (ive just bought skyrim though and its pretty awesome too) Zelda BOTW allows you to just get lost in the game.  There's so much to do!  Can't recommend enough!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,11,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Having always been a huge Zelda fan and having not owned a Wii U, I thought I'd splash out on the Switch console just to see what all the hype is about. Simply put, five stars is not enough: this game is an absolute masterpiece. If you're a Zelda fan this will not disappoint; I guarantee you won't be able to put this down. Money well spent!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,8,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Fantastic game.I've only played an hour or so, but the possibilities are endless. You can do whatever you want and go wherever you want.The game looks awesome and mechanics of it are great.Main annoying point is that all weapons break so easily!!All in all i'm looking forward to getting more stuck into this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,2,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Not been a player of the zelda series but have always been a fan of open world RPGs. This game absolutely blew me away, the aGraphical style, the huge open world, the brain teasing puzzles. Everything about this game was brilliant and if you have ever enjoyed any video game I think this is a must buy.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,9,2018,Royaume-Uni
good fun,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,6,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Just a fantastic game, couldn‚Äôt recommend enough. Can be played on both switch and switch lite, however some parts of the game are significantly more difficult on switch lite.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2020,Royaume-Uni
"This game is simply stunning.- Most amazing graphics.- Massive map which feels hand crafted not procedurally generated.- Wherever you look, there is detail and depth to the gameplay- Fun combat system.- Huge variety of enemies to fight and NPCs to interact with.- Well thought out puzzles to crack.The number of times I've just stopped to stare at the view.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,11,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Couldn't find one anywhere to buy, amazon pulls through again!!! Great quality, and speedy delivery",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,10,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I was honestly surprised how beautiful the game is and didn't think I would get addicted to it. I got the game just for the heck of it and wanted to know what the hype was about but now I am seriously impressed. The horse rising, the little puzzle in the shrine, physics all add something extra.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,9,2018,Royaume-Uni
"This game is, by far, one of the best I have ever played. Beautiful and rich in content, leaves you coming back for more constantly. Beating it is only 1/3 of the fun, doing all of the other countless hours of activities is what really sticks.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,4,2019,Royaume-Uni

"Played 80 hours on the Wii U and 120 hours on the Switch Version.It's not as complex as Skyrim, Witcher, Fallout etc, but just absolutely fantastic.Worth buying a Switch purely for this one game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,9,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Honestly one of my favorite games atm. It's a game that doesn't shower the hero with rewards, but rewards those who really give it their all. It makes you want to improve your strength and have the shadows of Hyrule cower at the mere mention of your name. A must have for anyone who has a love adventuring and challenge.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,19,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Great price, great game. Fast delivery and as expected. Maybe the best game I've ever played on any system. Certainly one of the best games ever if not the best.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,1,2020,Royaume-Uni

"Bought this for my Nintendo switch and was not dissapointed with it at all.

Son aged 9 loves this game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,1,2021,Royaume-Uni
Do I really have to review this? Seriously if you own a Switch and you don't already have this what the hell have you been playing? This is an incredible update to one of the best game series ever created. It's new in all the right ways while still retaining the charm of the older titles. Blown away by how good this is.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,7,2017,Royaume-Uni
Bought this as a family treat before school starts back and it's brilliant. Delivery was good too.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,8,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Loving this game! It‚Äôs looks beautiful and the controls are great, good plot and fun side questsIf I have any problems it‚Äôs that the weapons tend to break far too easily, the idea is that you‚Äôll have so many you won‚Äôt even care but i DID notice and I DO CARE!",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
"I've played hundreds of games since early 80s and Atari 2600, through many comps, consoles and handhelds.This is, without exaggeration, gaming perfection.  (I've never claimed that about any game before).Forget any previous Zelda game you've played before.  Dive in.  You won't regret it...",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2019,Royaume-Uni

"I bought it on launch date, and here we are over a year later. This game is a masterpiece. You can pick it up to play with absolutely no purpose at all and just randomnly walk around the vast world. The only game that took me aback like this was Ocarina of Time.The gaming world needs a strong Nintendo!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,11,3,2018,Royaume-Uni
Great game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,5,2021,Royaume-Uni
Brilliant game. I've played a lot of Zelda in my life time (Including a 13 hour straight zeldathon with ocarina of time) and this game is up there with some of the best. So much to explore and do in Hyrule including loads of puzzling shrines to get you thinking. Really enjoyed and would highly recommend.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,7,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Treats new players horrifically, not really faithful to older Zelda games, definitely has really weird design choices in regards to putting features into the game that just ruins any fun you may be having... but is actually quite stunning when you get into it. Played for hours... although never really saw the point of owning a horse. Just quick travel?",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,7,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Best game available for switch! It is just levels above all other games out there. Graphic is amazing and you can mostly do whatever you like form walking around, doing side quests or following the main story. A lot of hidden gems and easy control settings. Just the perfect game really. You can't go wrong with this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
Present for my Grandsons 8th birthday I know it‚Äôs quite a complex game but he is very smart and is getting along on it fine. Beautiful graphics and an intriguing game to keep you occupied for a while feeling of achievement as you solve the clues,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
My son loves this Nintendo switch came,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2020,Royaume-Uni
Amazing game. Probably the best game I've played in recent years. A huge amount of content with interesting gameplay which allows you to go about tasks in different ways. The Switch may not have the same grunt as other consoles this generation but you would never notice it on this game. I'm 35 hours in and barely scratched the surface of this stunning game. Recommended for any Switch owner.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This game has a very pleasing look to it and has great gameplay.There are many things to do in this game, it will take you a while to complete it.It works very well in handheld mode, which makes this game extra special.If you own a Nintendo Switch don't miss out, play this game!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,31,3,2018,Royaume-Uni

"Just incredible. Such a different take on the formula and it makes other open world games look like games for children under the age of 5. Very challenging, but not unfair. New, yet familiar. Probably one of the best games ever made. I honestly won't be mad if I paid 300$ just to play one zelda game on my switch, it's that good.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,12,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
Everything you'd expect from a legend of Zelda game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,5,2020,√âtats-Unis
"As a person who has never played a zelda game, this game has gotten me interested in the series. The beautiful game design and playful nature of the game, mixed with the RPG open-world elements make for hours upon hours of fun. Its also worth mentioning that this is one of the few games worth buying for the switch that are actually available at this moment in time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

"Have not seen my husband in months due to this little ol' thing :) Bought alongside the Nintendo Switch as a birthday present and he hasn't stopped telling me how amazing it is. Graphics, storyline, nostalgia, freedom of approach - all exceptional. Although find games very expensive, in comparison to the hours he has spent playing, cost per play is miniscule.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
"Good game, but to be honest little overrated in my opinion. It's really good, but that's all. 8.5/10 for me.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,9,2019,Royaume-Uni
"One of the good thing with Nintendo Switch is you can choose language even though you buy packaged software in a country other than your home country. I used to have a difficulty with download Japanese games for other console platform, but it's not the matter with Nintendo Switch. Zelda BoW is best to play in Japanese!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,10,2017,Royaume-Uni
good game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,3,2021,Royaume-Uni
"I only bougth the Switch because i wanted mario kart 8 , and just got this because there was nothing else to fill the void until mk8 came outI never played any zelda games, this is very good, and now im sad that i finished it, spent well over 100 hrs playing and kept going back looking for something else to",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Absolutely outstanding game, I haven't stopped playing it since I got it, I'm on my second play through and it is just amazing",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,20,2,2020,Royaume-Uni
I'm not into games but really love Zelda.  It's full of different 'trials' which I find challenges my brain as well as the nimbleness of my fingers!  A lot of thought has gone into the creation of this game and it really shows!  Definitely recommend Zelda Breath of the Wild.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,2,2018,Royaume-Uni
"I don't have the words to describe this game; awesome doesn't even come close. Beautiful to look at, challenging, creative; a great game that I feel we'll be playing for months! Play it on a big screen to get the best out of it. Landscapes are wonderful, especially when you paraglide. Console giroscope allows physical interaction to tilt bows and camera.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
This game really is everything the reviews say it is. Easily the best game of the last few years from what I have experienced so far. Redefines the series and the genre. It is no exaggeration how massive this game world is and it is a pleasure to explore and learn about. I won't spoil any details but just get it.There is a reason it is getting such high review scores.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
Buy the switch just for this game!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,11,2020,Inde
"My main issue with this game is the horrible weapon durability mechanic. Any weapon you get will only last so long before it breaks and you have to stop what you are doing and equip a different one. This takes the fun out of progressing and of fighting.Besides this issue the ""story"" is so bland as to be seemingly nonexistent, with the ""open world"" feeling more like an ""empty world"".",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
Bought for my granddaughter she loved it. Very interesting game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,9,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I can't really recommend enough to buy this game. Even if you're not a big fan of Legend of Zelda series or haven't played in your life a Zelda game, you'll enjoy it. Open world, big HUGE world, implicit references to old zelda games on locations, new race, new ways to battle and new characters... Hundreds of little quests... MUST HAVE!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,21,4,2017,Royaume-Uni

Excellent!!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,4,2021,Royaume-Uni
"I was amazed by this game when it first game out and it is still a good game. I got bored with the shrines and side quests as they really are repetitive and hardly worth the hassle. I spent over 250 hours on this and at the end i feel a bit let down by it. All i can say is dont complete the game first then do the shrines, as its very dull. Great scenery but for me its not the best game ever like so many first think, you'll get over the initial wow factor after endless trawls through the large world.I managed to only get 48% completion after over 250 hours",3,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
This a fantastic game and an absolute must-buy for Nintendo Switch owners and arguably the best game on the Switch. 10/10,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,2,2020,Royaume-Uni
"10/10 You do not need to know anymore than that. Yes it is expensive. But is it worth buying a whole new console just to play - YES! ¬£320 for one games & Yes I didn't hover over the cancel order 'stop kidding yourself' button several times. But I'm glad that I got it, paired with the Switch it is Phenomenal. I'm 42 and still a Zelda fan and have been since 1986.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,15,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

Christmas Present. Requested by grandson,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,12,2020,Royaume-Uni
Simply one of the best video games of all time. You shouldn't own a Switch and not have this in your game collection.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Glorious graphics and loads of gameplay mean that every member of the family has enjoyed this. One of the kids just loves catching and riding the horses, the other likes foraging and cooking, whilst my husband has played through the quests. A beloved franchise delivered really well, it is easy to see why this is one of the best games of all time.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2017,Royaume-Uni
I‚Äôm a huge Zelda fan and have played pretty much every game. This is brilliant. The freedom to explore the open world and do things your way. If you‚Äôve never played a Zelda game you‚Äôre missing out I think!,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,3,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I was super excited to play this game as I had watched many videos and it looked amazing! Unfortunately, having no previous experience with Zelda games, I was disappointed. The game started off fine but quickly I became stuck because the world is simply TOO large in my opinion. The Shrines became impossible without a guide (which ruined the challenge) and I was not a fan of the durability aspect of weapons/shields. Im sure if you were a hardcore Zelda fan you would appreciate this game much more and it would make a lot more sense to you.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2020,Royaume-Uni
Apparently this is an amazing game. My 9 year old loves it. Nice to get him off roblox and minecraft,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2020,Royaume-Uni
"Not a great deal to say more than any of the other positive reviews here. Amazing gameplay and atmosphere. I never thought I would rate it higher than the Ocarina of Time, it really is that good! My one and only criticism is the poor framerate. in certain areas, sub 30fps.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,4,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
I ordered this as one of my boyfriends Christmas presents. I purchased this for ¬£48.99 which was a brilliant deal considering they‚Äôre selling this game in most shops for ¬£60 now. My boyfriend likes the game and the game came exactly as described.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Absolutely every detail of this game is completely amazing. Wonderful scenery, charming characters, amazing story. I couldn‚Äôt recommend this game enough",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,17,1,2020,Royaume-Uni

"An absolute masterpiece of a game! I've played zelda since i was a young lad, and its just as amazing today as it was then! Can't recommend it enough!",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,8,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Very immersive, incredible design. 145 hours of play and still plenty to explore and discover. I bow to Nintendo's design team, they have certainly come up with something special. I hope they will extend the game for many episodes to come. Playing on the Switch is also a great experience, a winning combination in every way.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,9,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Brilliant my husband hasn't stopped playing since he received this on Christmas. A good story and characters because it‚Äôs Zelda. Fighting is brilliant the bows and arrows are fun, all the loot and gear is managed well. Have to collect stuff to cook foods and elixers. Definitely a game worth buying.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,29,12,2017,Royaume-Uni
The game is worth every penny it's up there with ocarina of time and majoras mask a must buy,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,26,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
Good  game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,1,2021,Royaume-Uni
"I'm not really a fan of Zelda, I always found the controls too frustrating and the puzzles too cryptic.  But this game is awesome, despite a few annoying puzzles the fact you can mostly approach them in any order, really helps to avoid getting burnt out by getting stuck in one particular spot with no way to proceed.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,22,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Fun game, the weapon durability can be annoying, at best it encourages you to use new gear all the time, at worst it leaves you having to back track a long way to get something suitable.Would play it more if not for the Switch's battery life not doing so hot with this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
Amazing game. Another amazing Zelda title. Love being able to just explore the world pretty much right from the opening.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
This game is absolutely terrific.You want a pet dog? You can.You want to become a photographer? You can.You want to become a cook? You can.You want to be a show jumper? You can.You want to dress in all black? You can.10/10,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
I liked the quality of the game but it can be very frustrating. I don't like the price think it's a bit too expensive.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,11,2019,Royaume-Uni
We liked the battles and the cooking and all of it really. It‚Äôs a very very good game.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
Its a great game but I can only give you a partial review as I lost my cartridge carry case before completing... And all my games where in it.If I had the money I would definitely buy it again.9/10 would lose again.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,9,2017,Royaume-Uni
"This game is a bit hard, but nice graphics, vast open world, lots to do.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,8,2019,Royaume-Uni
Some people said it is the best FRP ever. That is not true (at least for me) but still a great game with great graphics and storyline. Zelda is a most with any nintendo consoles! This is no different than that reality.,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,2,2018,Royaume-Uni
"One of the best video games ever. Don't hesitate, buy and play this game. Worth owning a Switch for.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,8,1,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I feel this will go down as a classic, everything I wanted from a Zelda game and more. Be aware it's pretty hard, lost count of deaths, but doesn't seem daunting, just a learning curve, truly promotes and rewards intelligent approach. Have noticed a few frame drops on Switch in docked mode, but only a minor distraction, runs great undocked. A real (not so little) beauty.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni
Excellent,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Open World ampio, ma lento. Sono ancora agli inizi, so che ci dovrebbe essere un po' di aiuto come mezzi, ma posso dire con certezza che sia difficile risolvere le quest se non si guardano video playthrough.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,9,2019,Italie
The Divine Beasts were a little disappointing but the rest of the game more than makes up for that.  The attention to detail by Nintendo is outstanding eg talk to Hestu without clothes on.The graphics are beautiful and show that maybe realism is not the way to go in video games.,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,10,6,2017,Royaume-Uni
Fun engaging game .,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,24,1,2020,Royaume-Uni

"My son loves this game. Only downside was the ¬£18 we had to spend on the expansion pack. At the price of this game, it should be included.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,3,7,2019,Royaume-Uni
The best game ever. This game show how the hardware power means nothing compare to the game developed for it. An open world with new point of view a bit mechanism of the creature that live in.

"Ormai lo sanno tutti, √® un'avventura magnifica, grafica spettacolare, storia avvincente.

"While not a perfect game, don't believe the hype it isn't perfect there are problems, frame rate issues is the main one. However it's still a very good game. A score of 8 and a half out of 10 is a fair score in my opinion.",4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,23,4,2017,Royaume-Uni
"Five stars really just isn't enough to do this game or the Nintendo Switch justice!!!!!!And if you cannot make your mind-up whether to get yourselves a home console, or a portable games system then worry not, cos, the Nintendo Switch gives you the best of BOTH worlds!!!!!!!!!!!!Well-done Nintendo, you've done it again.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,5,3,2017,Royaume-Uni

To say the world is large would be an understatement.  Takes about half an hour to walk from one end of the map to the other.  There is just so much to see and do that you lose all track of time.  You will die a LOT lol,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,6,5,2017,Royaume-Uni
This is the best video game i have ever played. Its suitable for 7 years and up and guves hours of gameplay. Follow the story or just explore Hyrule. Can‚Äôt fault this game,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,14,3,2019,Royaume-Uni

This game is incredible I got it a year or more ago and forgot to write a review about it I highly recommend this game the story is great same with the dlc,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,1,2019,Royaume-Uni
"Let me be real, everyone loves this game. But to me it is a zelda trying to be a jrpg, which zelda never was. I loved zelda for what zelda was not what it is becoming. It is neat and a decent prequel, but minus remasters and hyrule warriors, I don't see wasting my money on a game that feels like a badly made Tales series game. Bring back The magic of OOT and MM and even some of those Gameboy color games and a link between worlds... your real fans will love it. Also Twilight princess needs a upgrade more than skyward sword ever did.",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,30,4,2021,√âtats-Unis
"Love it, great adventure around Hyrule, only gripe is, once you've finished it, you can't carry on playing without going back the point before you beat the final boss.  I'd like a free-roam option really, with all the guardians turned off.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,2,2018,Royaume-Uni

Grandson loves it !,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,13,9,2020,Royaume-Uni
Really good but Mario on Switch is better. Had a break for a few months came back to it and couldn‚Äôt really remember anything. Doesn‚Äôt happen with Mario as it‚Äôs not dependent on remembering story/characters,4,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,16,2,2018,Royaume-Uni
This game doesn‚Äôt have the real life look a lot of games for the PS4 or X Box have but the artistic style is stunning and the game is amazing. I can‚Äôt recommend enough,5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,28,12,2018,Royaume-Uni

"I had high hopes for this game after reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews. Sadly I got bored and frustrated with this game after only a few hours. I found the gameplay too restrictive from the outset. Can't go there cause you've not got item X, can't go here cause you've not got item Y, you'll die if you try and do thing A. It got tedious very quickly, and I couldn't imagine myself putting in the hours in order to complete it so I returned it for a refund. Sure it's a great game if you're into that sort of thing but it wasn't for me.",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,12,2018,Royaume-Uni

"where do I start..i was ;looking forward to this release but it is so disappointing...it's boring, repetitive and empty......the weapons break so you acquire more weapons to kill the same enemy only for them to break again and so on so forth...you do not level up or get new skills, the world is vast but uneventful.. the enemy variety is low, the quests boring . when you do beat the boss you get nothing and the game saves at this point like you never beat Ganon at all..i like to be rewarded in games with new weapons, skills etc..this game rewards you zilch..you give and give and get nothing in return",2,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,2,2018,Royaume-Uni

"Honestly tried and tried and tried to give this game every chance to redeem itself but it just let me down every time. The story and narrative is barely there and there is nothing but walking and gliding between a shrine or quest marker. The game does not appreciate your time so it was very hard for me to appreciate things this game was trying to achieve. Wasn't expecting another ocarina of time master piece, but was not expecting such a let down either. AVOID!!",1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,18,2,2020,Royaume-Uni

I actually found this game to be extremely boring. I sort of fell asleep whilst playing it. I am disappointed. I played so many Zelda games previously but this one is too different. I understand others may like it but I hate it. It is very repetitive.Nintendo focused way too much on graphics and voice acting. Too many boring side quests like collecting leaves or chasing after demented horses. Dungeon bosses look very similar. Not enough variety. Even when the game offers something new it is so boring and pointless.,1,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,7,1,2018,Royaume-Uni

"HUGE does not begin to describe the playable area in Zelda: Breath of the Wild and quite how all that information fits on the TINY cartridge is one of life's mysteries.The non-linear style is a welcome change from traditionally rigid RPGs and the crazy amount of side quests can lead to hours, days or weeks being lost performing tasks which may appear to have nothing to do with the main quest(s). However, all that exploration is rewarded with extra rupees, weapons and ultimately makes you stronger so it's all good.......very good.If like me you are the sort of player who likes to explore every inch of the map and find everything which is available to aid your quest then you will definitely LOVE this game.The various enemies may get a little repetitive but the need to defeat them is always evident due to the degradation of weaponry making it essential to constantly hunt for new swords, bows and shields - add to that the fact that they drop useful items for cooking (making meals and elixirs) and you have every action being rewarded in some way.I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes RPG's or wants to experience what the best of them can be like to play....make no mistake, this is the best of them.Awesome stuff - Nintendo have done it again and it is no surprise that Breath of the Wild has picked up the amount of awards it has, including game of the year as it would take something VERY special to beat any aspect of this game.",5,ZELDA BOTW,AMAZON,27,1,2018,Royaume-Uni
