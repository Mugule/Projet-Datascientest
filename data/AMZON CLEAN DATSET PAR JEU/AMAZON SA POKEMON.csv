"I love it, need to play the new ones now though",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,21,2,2023,Royaume-Uni
"Been out of the Pok√©mon game since Crystal so there was much to readjust, and I can't compare it to the previous ones in my knowledge gap hiatus. However, I found this game enjoyable and fun in places, though it seems a bit short and unpolished.Difficulty-wise, it is rather easier, given the other Pok√©mon in your party gain experience points, even by not battling (unlike the old ones were they have to face the opponent at least once during a battle and the subsequent switching trick). This invariably speeds things up and avoids the long drawn out traditional process which can get tiring after a while. Of course, some might prefer the old style, and some suggest there should have been a function to switch that group experience gain off, which I feel there should be to give people a bit more extra challenge and impetus to spend more time in the field training their Pok√©mon. The trainers and gym leaders and rivals along the way aren't particularly challenging if you train up a good team well; in fact you could easily be over 10 lvls above their own Pok√©mon with not much extra training in the field. They don't seem to have any big teams at all until you're at the end of the main story, so even if you've got a weak team in terms of bad matchups, you'll have fewer opponents to face anyway so it doesn't matter if one or two of your team faints, you've got the numbers to beat them either way. From what I've heard, the real challenge is post-main game with the Battle Tower and actual real-life online battles with people from all over the world who would be far more experienced and knowledgeable than the NPC opponents who are, for obvious reason, set at a lower standard and level to ease you (be it beginner or experienced player) into the game. However, from what I've seen and heard, the online battles are not as good as previous incarnations in that they have limited a lot of functions and things that make the battles more enjoyable.It is unfortunate that it does not have the complete national Pok√©dex, and it is a complaint that many have with this game.The story does convey some mystery of sorts though it seems to be a bit clich√©d in places and it feels like an after thought. However, the characters are rather well presented and developed for the most part. They don't just appear once then that's that. In particular, you have several 'rivals' that have different character developments and plot twists. Your main rival or sorts, Hop, is annoying at first but he eventually grows on you and you eventually do feel sorry for his oblivious naivety. The Galar area is obviously based on the UK and it was fun to try and guess where each town/city was based on (Wyndon is obviously based on London, Motostoke probably Birmingham, Circhester on Bath, etc; I do wonder how many people pronounced 'Postwick' as 'pozzick' which would have been the British way to do so (i.e. 'Smethwick' as 'smevvick', 'Warwick' as 'worrick', etc)). But, compared to previous games, it feels a bit smaller, with routes shorter and not many cave and building like areas to explore.Graphics and animation-wise, it is not very polished and there are places where it is glitchy. I'm not too personally fussed but some people might take a big issue with it.Music is one of the things that I liked, especially some of the battle themes.New features are worth mentioning.- The Pok√©mon camp feature is rather fun. In previous games, they pretty much stay in your Pok√©balls and you only interact with them in battle. The camp feature lets you play with them and cook with them. This also brings benefits, such as better battle reactions and evasive likelihoods. It makes Pok√©mon feel a little more real than just battle machines. The curry dex also gives you another dimension of things to do other than battling and catching. However, you can't pet the Pok√©mon which is a disappointment.- The Wild Area is also an innovative way to open up the area that are usually restricted to Routes and Caves. You can catch all manner of Pok√©mon in this area, from very low to very high levels, and the selection changes everyday and with different weather conditions. This makes it a very good way to train your team and also catch high level Pok√©mon near the end of the main game when you don't fancy training up a low level one from scratch and need one desperately to face off a particular opponent (and using the Move Master at the Centre to tweak the moves of these Pok√©mon is a good way to get them to learn back old forgotten, but useful, moves). Hwoever, the area is a bit bleak and monotonous. It would have been nice to have different Wild Areas in other locations that can be unlocked later in the game that have more stronger challenging Pok√©mon.-Dynamaxing: at this point, I don't think this necessarily adds anything to the franchise. It does feel like a novelty more than anything, something to make battles a little bit more exciting/challenging. The jury's not out yet for this feature.Overall, I do like this game for the potential and initial fun though it feels like a incomplete game, maybe even rushed. It remains to be seen what the DLCs would be like and whether they patch up some of the problems, though the DLCs are very expensive for what they are and I'm not sure if they would save the whole game from average.Is it worth it? You might want to wait and not pay full whack for it. But as a quick game for a beginner it might suit your needs.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,25,5,2020,Royaume-Uni

"a lot about the game was fun. the main conflict was stupid. it was so, so stupid. and saying 'well, what do you expect from a kid's game?' is insulting to children.but other than that, the game was very fun, had some great new features, some great new pokemon. not much else to say, really.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,6,1,2023,√âtats-Unis
"For me, this game was fantastic! Of course, I know a lot of people are not going to like this game and I will give reasons why you should or shouldn‚Äôt buy this game.First of all, this is not the USA version, it‚Äôs the European (I believe).The game has a certain controversy called ‚ÄòDexit‚Äô in which a portion (234) of the 898 Pok√©mon are missing in the game. They cannot be caught or transferred from a later game. So some of your favorites may not be in it.This game also has DLC ($29.99), paid content to further your gameplay. I have the DLC and I really enjoyed it. There‚Äôs a whole new island and another new area to discover with brand new stories.This game has a ‚Äòboring, unmemorable gimmick.‚Äô Pok√©mon games usually have a gimmick like X and Y‚Äôs mega evolution but Sword and Shield‚Äôs is Dynamax/Gigantamax. Basically Pok√©mon get bigger and more powerful for 3 turns. Some Pok√©mon change appearances also. You can decide whether you like it or not. I don‚Äôt hate it or love it, so it didn‚Äôt really ruin the game for me.This game is pretty easy. It is one of the easiest games to beat. For me, I didn‚Äôt dynamax through the whole story or use any items in battle to up the difficulty. You could also try a nuzlocke or another challenge. This is the right difficulty for kids though.There is character customization so you can dress up but you cannot change your Gender once you select it.For returning players, this game has added some quality of life features like the removal of HM‚Äôs (yay) and many new Pok√©mon. There is also a new fairy type if you played before X and Y. No more heart scales to relearn moves either!For competitive players, this game makes it really easy to breed Pok√©mon and teach them old moves (no heartscales)! They can max out IV‚Äôs with an item and there are lots of TM‚Äôs and TR‚Äôs (one-time-use TM‚Äôs). Don‚Äôt worry - you can get multiple TR‚Äôs of the same move.Multiplayer- this game has some multiplayer aspect to it. There‚Äôs online (playing using internet) and local (people physically next to you). You engage in battles by teaming up with 3 other people and fighting a big dynamax Pok√©mon. BEWARE: You will have to pay for a subscription to play online ($20 for 1 year). Locally, it‚Äôs basically the same thing as online but you don‚Äôt need a subscription and you see the person. Each person also needs their own copy of Sword or Shield and their own switch, which can get pricey.There are still version exclusives. Basically, this game and Pok√©mon Shield are the same game but with minor tweaks. *maybe small, minor spoilers ahead* There are 2 gym leaders exclusive to each game (Sword has Fighting and Rock and Shield has Ghost and Ice). Also, some Pok√©mon are only found in 1 copy of the game (either sword or shield).Most, if not all, trade Pok√©mon can be caught in the wild.That‚Äôs all for my review. I personally loved this game but it ultimately comes down to you if you want it. It‚Äôs the perfect addition for kids!",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,5,3,2021,√âtats-Unis

Game has content! I know shocking. Isle of Armor dlc isn't worth it but I recommend The Crown Tundra! It's like the Legends Arceus snow area but with a cool interesting story around Calyrex.,4,POKEMON,AMAZON,25,12,2022,Royaume-Uni
"This game adds a great new set of Pokemon with very interesting abilities. Competitive play is a lot of fun and it's much easier for newbies to get into competitive. Dynamax is probably the best gimmick among the recent Pokemon games. Main game is kinda straightforward and short but the wild area concept is really cool, and the champion is one of the strongest in the series.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,9,2022,Inde

"So I had to sit down and write a review for this game after reading a few others and seeing that they have clearly missed the whole point of this game! One review here states they completed it in 20 hours and so one starred it...well I am 15 hours into the game and am just on my way to 4th gym.  The reason is is that this is not a game you are meant to grab a team of 6 and blast through everything.Like most people I was turned off by some of the features that were to be included, Dynamax, lack of National Dex, etc.  But I picked it up anyway and instantly found myself immersed as I emerged from my house and saw Wooloos (sheep pokemon) grazing and Butterfrees flying overhead.  It felt like I truly was stepping into the world of Pokemon.  As someone who has played since Gen 1, I was impressed.  I also enjoyed how they set you up for the gym challenge with you having to be endorsed/sponsored.After watching a brief animation of the starters mucking around I picked up my Grooky and was ready to begin my adventure...but first a narrative forced route through The Slumbering Weald, a dense forest thick with fog that began to cloud my vision with haunting music playing through the background.  There a strange pokemon emerged before me, a chilling cry spreading fog further into my path, I attacked but to no avail, then blacked out and awoke to find it gone.  Not going to lie...I was intrigued.  For the first time in a long time I wanted to know more!!Following the usual shtick, i.e. fight rival, be the best blah blah blah I found myself in the heart of the game, the Wild Area, and this place is awesome! Think a smaller scale Breath of the Wild.  Unlike most games there are not just a handful of pokemon, as the weather and time changes you can find more than 30-40 pokemon around here, this gives you huge team opportunities and will allow for future playthroughs to be different each time.  I wandered to the right and picked up a Tyrogue and a handful of new pokemon.  I then encountered the first issue in game, that people moan about...not being able to turn off EXP Share.  I arrived at the first city and headed around towards the gym where I trounced the first gym with absolute ease and my pokemon were a good 4 levels over despite me being careful and avoiding trainers and wild battles so as not to overlevel.  I returned to the Wild Area and decided I wanted to spend some time exploring and just enjoying the game, so I boxed my main team and pulled out a fresh new team of 6 of randoms that I didn't care if I levelled up, and this is where I found the real joy and heart of this game.  Wandering around and exploring the lush scenery and finding all the hidden gems and pokemon, camping out and searching for rare, exotic items and pokemon, switching my team around every so often to raise some of the new critters I had found.  This is NOT a game to run around with 6 pokemon, but a game that allows you to swap and change your team and raise them quickly so you don't have to worry if a new pokemon comes along that you want to try.  My main team of 6 quickly began changing as I tried out every new pokemon I could find.  My Tyrogue became Hitmonlee and I picked up a Toxel from the nursery...one of the COOLEST evolutions I have ever seen! I even picked up the Apple pokemon which again evolved into a surprisingly awesome dragon! Well done Gamefreak! The designs for this game are some of the best in a long time!In short I will spend hours more on this game just exploring and raising all the new pokemon.  I'm currently swapping between around 20 pokemon (you have a portable pokemon box so can switch on the go). You set your own challenge.  I keep my main team for the story and am finding they are even slightly underlevelled now which is great as the wild pokemon end up being really strong and gym trainers and challengers actually put up more of a fight! But if I so wish I can power them up with a few random battles against the stronger Wild Area pokemon.  So don't rush and overpower yourself, just take your time and enjoy exploring everything! There's plenty of side quests and hidden gems to find",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,11,2019,Royaume-Uni
I honestly never got to play the game because I was going to get because I thought it could have up to 4 players but turns out it only has 1 player so I sent it back,4,POKEMON,AMAZON,1,12,2022,√âtats-Unis

I wish it had disclosed that sword and shield are basically the same game but each has a few charactors that the other doesn't. Not worth buying the game twice for just some minar charactor differences. Also there aren't many as I have been playing both games and have yet to find any difference between them. It won't be the sales fault obviously. It is the game developers. But it would be better if the add declared a warning that they are not two different games. I could have chosen one of the other bundles and had two games instead of one twice. Not worth the money paid by far.,4,POKEMON,AMAZON,8,9,2022,Royaume-Uni
"...there are a few things that disturb me. first I'll come to the really great things. the Galar Region in which this story takes place, is very beautifully designed with big hills and stuff - what you might have missed in the previous generations. there is a ""Wild Area"" where the weather changes from day to day and you have different possibilities of catching various Pok√©mon, from which some may even chase you if you go nearby. you may even rotate your view, but this is limited to the Wild Area - in other areas you have the same primitive isometric view as in the former Pok√©mon games. the soundtrack of the game is surprisingly very good at some points - even a bit mesmerizing, so you could dive into your Pok√©mon experience even further. though I'm very glad that you can finally (!!!) turn off the music completely with the other sounds still being active (that's really a game changer for me since I like to listen to other music while playing the game and don't like it to be completely silent).unfortunately the main story line isn't challenging at all and those other trainers you'll come along just start to annoy you sooner or later. same for the Gym Trainers; the only ones which are somewhat competitive appear in the ""Battle Tower"" which you're granted access after completing the game. and you may of course compete in the monthly competitions which are truly challenging and this is the very reason I play the fourth generation of Pok√©mon anyway; the main storyline becomes it's means in the end.it's a shame that you only get crucial hints by several YouTubers though - at least they could put some true ""Trainer Tips"" like the use of the Destiny Knot and Everstone for breeding purposes into the game. and some Gym Trainers could use advanced tactics like having a Trick Room team or something, which would make it a little more challenging, there could have been different difficulty levels so the game would be even interesting for those who don't want to compete in any Online Competitions.the fact that you only get the most important information by some YouTubers makes you believe that you may rely on what they're saying. but the developers made some changes in the newest update in January, there you get punished if you made use of certain techniques as the ""Date Spamming"". none of them knew that those exploits will break your game later in that you can't have certain advantages for competing online, so you can't blame them. but that's why I had to buy another version of that game (and do so much stuff AGAIN!!!) so I'm not punished for not knowing what will happen later. this really makes it hard to remain calm.the last thing I find very upsetting is that there is so blatant satanic symbolism in the game like the Pok√©ball in front of each Gym has small edges in the middle of it so it forms a Saturn with three sixes inside of it. this makes me very disappointed, though I really like the game and this whole Pok√©mon universe that's why I'm giving it four stars anyway.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,2,2020,Allemagne
"I love this game. It's very fun and it can be difficult to battle and go through the gym leaders. You get to catch other types of Pok√©mon. It's almost addicting. Beware of playing this game, you might get distracted. I love it!",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,11,2022,√âtats-Unis

"This is such a good take on the classic Pok√©mon games from game boys, the game is meant to be set in Pok√©mon Britain and is a easy enough for 6 years to play, would recommend very good game",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,5,11,2022,Royaume-Uni
"Overall this game is very good in terms of graphics and general storyline. It plays similar to previous editions of pokemon on the 3ds and ds. Without spoiling the game too much, I can honestly say I enjoyed the game because of how much I love pokemon.BUT there is a lot of things that made me feel like this isn't the five star pokemon game I was hoping for;To start with I was pretty disappointed with the starter pokemon final evolutions, especially Inteleon and Cinderace, both of which look too human like in their stances and overall look. I prefer them looking more pokemon/animal like. So for me as someone who has played since pokemon red/blue, I was disappointed.The main reason for me giving this four stars is that I am rather disappointed that the game has changed as much as I hoped. It is almost exactly the same as previous versions of the game. I was hoping that it would be more like pokemon collusuem/pokemon xd. I also was disappointed that I was not able to transfer my pokemon or even get all the pokemon from previous generations in this game. I knew that would be the case as he developers made it clear, but they insisted this was due to the new pokemon models in the game, however as many have stated in the reviews and online, the models have honestly not changed, or barely changed. So I don't see the reason behind the lack of pokemon in this game.Another thing I find really annoying is the lack of menu before starting the game. When you click the game and load it up on the nintendo switch menu, if you have made a save file already, it loads straight into that save file. So if you want to start a brand new save file, you have to delete all the app data which is a bit tedious. I would prefer the load/new save file option menu like in previous games.Would still recommend it for anyone who is a diehard pokemon fan such as myself, because it is a good game, just not the best4/5( Click ‚ÄúHelpful‚Äù if this helped ^__^ )",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,11,2019,Royaume-Uni
"As someone who enjoys the format and basis of Pokemon games, this was a really fun game and I enjoyed my time playing it. But I can see why some people are leaving negative reviews as it doesn't really bring any thing new to the table when it comes to mainline Pokemon games.When comparing the game with other mainline games in the series, I think that my money would be better spent on Legends: Arceus which is a completely new experience and definitely brings a new perspective to the series.Overall, enjoyable game, but not the best option for the console.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,29,4,2022,Royaume-Uni
"This game was extremely good, i completed the entire thing already and got zacian, About to do the battle tower.A lot of people are review bombing this game because they are too easily convinced by twitter, But really, this game is fantastic, The story was great, the characters, the new pok√©mon, the wild area, all the new items and mechanics, It's really improved since ultra sun and moon and i feel sad for all the people boycotting this incredible game, they are the ones missing out.What i loved most about this game the most was the wild zone, it is so much fun to go there and catch a load of pok√©mon in a huge open area and do the dens, You can collect W (watts) and redeem them for items like TMs and wishing pieces (which are used to attract dynamax pok√©mon in the dens).The game was a little easy but you can definitely challenge yourself if you avoid the wild zone and just play like you would in any other pok√©mon game, I got so over levelled to the point where i was avoiding trainers.Spoilers ahead:The story was pretty good, You take part in the ""gym challenge"" with loads of other trainers and compete to battle the champion, If you succeed and beat the champion you become the champion (just like other games) Instead of it just being you and your rival doing the gyms, it's lots of other people, you meet some of these other characters during the gym challenge, Like bede who was ""endorsed"" by the chairman and thinks he's more important than you, and eventually gets disqualified, but becomes a gym leader later in the game and battles you during the finals.You can't trade pok√©mon from previous games which is a bit of a shame for some people, Personally i don't mind since i prefer to use the pok√©mon that were actually in the game anyways.I could go on, but i don't have the time, I give this game a 9/10, It was very good and there were very few issues with it.",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,18,11,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I first played Pokemon Red and then took a break for about 15 years, since then I have played all subsequent titles very recently. I have to say it is the worst mainline pokemon game I have ever played for the following reasons.- NegativeIt isn‚Äôt a challenge at all - There are no difficult battles or routes. Exp share is always on and you can‚Äôt turn it off - so levelling is really easy. You get exp candies for completing the wild area raids, so it isn‚Äôt hard or time consuming to evolve a full pokedex. There are no caves or forests with more than 4 trainers. In fact every route except the final one has no more than 4 battles, most of these trainers with just one pokemon. Fishing is only on dark spots and there is one limited ocean to explore. Only one wild area and it didn‚Äôt take me long to explore it fully, maybe about two hours. Once you have the pokedex data for your opponent pokemon, the game tells you in battle, whether or not your attacks will be effective before you use them. This makes it even easier. There is no team rocket or ‚Äúevil‚Äù team to pursue, there is a ‚Äúteam yell‚Äù but this just involves lots of unnecessary speech and about 5 battles in total across the whole game. The gym challenges are essentially like the thunder gym in pokemon red and are a bit limited. The dragon gym leader only has one dragon despite there being around 10 dragon evolution lines in the game. You can‚Äôt use the pokeball controller either. There are no HM‚Äôs or any need for them, you have flying taxis from the first city making the railways rather pointless - i only used them twice when the story required me too. The story is very limited talking about a ‚Äúdark day‚Äù in the past but they always tell you to just focus on your gym challenge rather than explaining it in anyway. Some of the new pokemons designs are awful - the four fossil pokemon are basically just two designs with different colours. The gigantimaxing seems fairly pointless as you can‚Äôt use it on online battles only in game at gyms etc. This is unnecessary as everything in your party will be overpowered anyway as I was 20 levels higher than my opponents for the entire game. Apart from one pokemon the galarian forms aren‚Äôt interesting type wise or by design. Seeing as it is the first mainline game available to play on a tv the graphics aren‚Äôt that great with obvious touches missed out such as bark on trees. Lets Go had better graphics. The wild area camera is glitchy and it is hard to use. There is no long catching/battling experience such as silph tower or the rock tunnel. Half the time your opponents will heal your party halfway through anyway - such as the final championship - making it even easier. There are no new animations for anything rendering their excuse of not including a full pokedex ridiculous. The camping is pointless, only did it once, as you can fly to key places in the wild area to heal anyway. The new starters are weak and only single typed rendering them basically pointless past the first two badges. Charmander is available but not bulbasaur or squirtle. Butterfree but not beedrill. Really strange choices made there.+ PositiveThe wild area is a good idea if only there could be more than one and trainers in it. I liked the championship idea but it needed to be more challenging.Overall I am pretty disappointed, it could have been an amazing game but instead they botched it. Overall the game just feels unfinished, they should have beefed the story up, corrected some of the graphical anomalies, included the full dex and added more components to the game like they have done in previous games. It definitely is the most limited mainline adventure I have played and I did not feel challenged at any point. Unfortunate, i will wait for reviews of the next one before buying it.",2,POKEMON,AMAZON,28,11,2019,Royaume-Uni

"It‚Äôs very short and I‚Äôd say not worth the ¬£45 or so I paid for it. It‚Äôs fine, I liked it. Best thing about it is the dlc, kind of. The dlc drags on a bit and is quite the hassle, though it does give you access to tons of legendaries!",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,15,9,2022,Royaume-Uni
"This is my first Pok√©mon game since Pok√©mon Yellow many moons ago.Graphics are pretty good and are cartoony like previous titles - maybe not as impressive as Breath of the Wild but still quite decent. The region of Galar is bright and colourful. Like old titles, you can find items out in the world like Poke Balls and potions, and talking to NPCs can land you some nice goodies.The Pok√©mon themselves are quite good, maybe not quite the classics as previous Generations. They seem to level up quite quickly, in just slightly over 3 hours most of my team are over level 10, and my Scorbunny (my starter Pok√©mon) has just evolved.Not all previous Pok√©mon are in the game which has caused quite a bit of controversy as you can't now (to my understanding) ""catch 'em all"". That's a bit of shame but maybe including all 800+ Pok√©mon (or whatever the total number is now!) would have significantly extended development time on the game, and considering the ""next gen"" nature, may have been infeasible (e.g. pushing up development costs). This doesn't really bother me though as there's still plenty of Pok√©mon to see and catch, and there's more depth here I think than the likes of the mobile game, Pok√©mon Go.Overall, a pretty good Pok√©mon game and a good first attempt for the Switch. Maybe not the best entry for those who have played the other titles but so far I've enjoyed it.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,11,2019,Royaume-Uni
"I have played a lot of the old school Pokemon games; Red, Blue, Yellow, Gold, Silver, Crystal, Diamond, Pearl and Platinum - the games after that I don't have much experience with. I decided to get back into them and purchased Pokemon Sword - most of the basic gameplay is the same as I remember, but there are somethings which are different and not necessarily for the best. (Found the water bike and air taxi's weird and sort of takes the fun out of using your pokemon for that stuff) Personally I have found it to be not as indepth as the ones i have previously played - I have had it a week and have finished the gym and championship challenges. There is lots of stuff to do in the wild areas but I just don't find it as challenging as the older games. There used to usually be an evil side challenge to be dealing with at the same time, and although there is a sort of side task its not really something you get to be involved with that much - at least thats what i have found so far. Also why are the Pokemon SO ugly and weird in the newer games?! All in all, not a bad game, but not the best of the bunch either. Will be interesting to see what the future games will be like.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,24,4,2020,Royaume-Uni

"The game is great fun, but not the same as the games I grew up loving. The quality of the packaging is great as per usual from switch games and there was no issues here. The game itself is, at its core, no different from most Pokemon games. It‚Äôs just a bit empty. There‚Äôs much better animation and very fun 3D graphics, but there‚Äôs a sore hole missing in difficulty and content. Thankfully, as it‚Äôs the most recent game there‚Äôs constant online features and DLC being added to keep the game alive, so the lack of content is less of an issue now. The game is too easy however. Because all of your Pokemon gain EXP after a battle now, not just those involved, your team races up the levels and you can steam right through the game!The setting is fun, even if the UK references are very over the top compared to what previous games did. It certainly adds charm to the game though, and made me enjoy exploring the now much bigger towns and cities more than I had done previously.All in all, a good game, but die hard fans of the originals will be left wanting more. A great place for new comers to jump in however!",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,25,6,2020,Royaume-Uni
"This game is quite controversial but it's really not that bad!I found it rather enjoyable. The graphics are better then people make it out to be but it might lag for a few secs in some parts (not often tho)  The region is really beautiful, from the buildings to misty forests. The characters look really cool and colorful, really happy with their design .It's kinda a disappointing that there is not that many new pokemons but majority of them look really cool or cute. Tho it feels sometimes like they are missing some animations when they attack.Compared to the old games this one is really and I mean REALLY easy. The gym battles are nothing, I beat majority of them with my starter pokemon and without switching. It also has the controversial exp share so it makes leveling some much easier (it really depends on you if its a plus or not) Also you can really get lost in the wild are and spend a lot of time there!Overall:It's pretty nice and chill game. I don't think it deserves all the controversy it got and its really not that bad that people made it out to be. But if you are HARDCORE pokemon fan you mighty be disappointed with some of the decisions or features",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,15,12,2019,Royaume-Uni

"There are good and bad bits about this game (as there would be for any other). The good things are, that Its a new adventure, new pokemon, graphics are incredible, the wild area‚Äôs an adventure, its cool to fight the giant pokemon. But the bad stuff are that the game feels too arcadey, it‚Äôs too fast. Before you know it you‚Äôre at level 30 and not even faced the first gym.Myself, I‚Äôve played every gen of pokemon games and I prefer the older ones. The reason why is because I enjoy the feeling of the older buildings and world. This game feels too much like a iOS game... where you have stages and complete stages before going to the next one. It feels too fast and a lack of direction in the game.But there are really fantastic stuff about the game, the graphics are incredible, new story, new Pokemon, and the amount of work that‚Äôs gone into the game is phenomenal. Its just not my cup of tea, for me personally, its just too fast.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,7,2020,Royaume-Uni
"The idea of Dynamax pokemon might seem great, but it gets stale and is an uninteresting way to win battles. The graphics aren‚Äôt amazing, and you cannot get all the previous pokemon like you could in previous games, without buying the DLC. The storyline is not magnificent, and definitely needs work, but the redeeming feature about this is the online comparability and the wild area. The DLC is AMAZING, but that costs too much money for the content of it, considering it is a DLC. Overall, the game is average",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,21,4,2022,Royaume-Uni
"After playing this through to the end, this game truly was great.  I haven't played a Pokemon game since Stadium on the Nintendo 64, and was not disappointed.  I love the sheer variety of different Pokemon you can catch, as well as the gym battles and the champion's cup.  I really liked the dynamax feature where your Pokemon turn gigantic too.  My only gripe is that the game isn't that like long, a little over 20 hours and is relatively easy to complete.  Apart from this this is a five star game.",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,2,1,2022,Royaume-Uni
"Giving it four stars because the product is perfectly functional and as described. The game itself disappointed me. I've enjoyed Pokemon merchandise and cards since I was a kid but never played the games. This was my first Pokemon game so take this review with a grain of salt. I was disappointed by the game and quickly grew tired of it. Granted, I was mostly looking forward to collecting Pokemon and the story line over pvp but I was definitely underwhelmed. Your npc friend is perhaps the least interesting fictional character I've encountered and dialog feels like complete filler. (No voice acting and many scenes skipped like the $60 game did not animate me eating with a gym leader, they just skip the whole interaction). The npcs are really un-special in my opinion, mostly repeat and lack dimension. I feel cheated. I enjoy Pokemon GO much more and it's... free.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,9,12,2020,√âtats-Unis
"This probably could have scored higher (it did have that potential), but it has some features missing, you can't even get all of the Poke'mon in this game, and some of them have to be purchased in DLCesque ways to be in the game at all. For the Poke'mon motto to be ""gotta catch'em all"" for all these years, after playing this I am sad to report that it has now changed to ""gotta buy'em all"".",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,2,8,2022,√âtats-Unis
"Now this game is quite fun! I have a few issues with it though. The problems are mostly graphical.So to start with the pros:1. Great story line2. Characters & new features are great!3. I like how they include old sounds from previous pokemon games - Stricly personal reasoninigCons:1. Graphics are poor - What's up with those trees? They look like someone from reception scribbled within the lines.2. The pokemon move stiffly... There is no fluid motions3. Small ramps and tiny cliff parts cannot be walked over or cycled - In real life and other games, this wouldn't be an issue4. The game lost a lot of previous features and I miss that. Why does a multi-million buck company not produce better quality games? They have all the resources. Games like Zelda or Mario have a fraction of the income Pokemon has had. Come on Nintendo!!! Give us a better game we all know you can produce! The switch isn't being used to it's full potential!To conclude I gave it a 3/5 even though I would have been more likely to give it a 50/100 - Simply due to the game not using up the full potential Nintendo could have done with it and the switch. I am upset the game lacks drastic improvements I thought were going to be implemented, however, it's a pokemon game. If it ain't broke why improve the pokemon community?Meh, good game. Not great :(",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,3,8,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I love this game great graphics and some amazing animations, this is the first game in the franchise other than my first pokemon game ( emerald)  that made me cry at the intro ( getting you starter) with excitement at how good it felt,  I especially love dynamaxing my pokemon.  As for the new pokemon I like them thought there doesn't seem to be as many as in some other games, including galar forms which I love and I am glad regional variants stayed.  The things I don't like about this game are,  some of the animations feel lazy,  like double kick the pokemon literally just moves up and down still in its idle animation not even its attack animation plays.  The lack of a National dex botheres me but I can understand that it would be a lot of extra work to make new models and animations for all 700+ pokemon but it still could have been added at a later date.  Overall a good pokemon game that's a must buy for any pokemon fan :)",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,22,2,2020,Royaume-Uni

"I've played Pok√©mon since day ONE, including Red, Blue, Yellow etc. That's my angle for this review, so I hope that means something.I bought Sword for my girlfriend's son (knowing I'd be playing it myself). I just didn't get that same feeling or buzz, that I got from past Pok√©mon games. And no it's not due to my age! The game just doesn't have the challenge of the old games. You don't have to work hard to beat the game, spending hours training your team. The days of being a real Pok√©mon trainer are gone, with the XP share you have from the start of the game, as your party levels up super quick. You can also send Pok√©mon to do jobs, so they gain XP without even being in your party, as well as receiving XP boosts from raids. Having everything given to me just took away that feeling of working hard to achieve my goal of being a Pok√©mon master. As fun as Sword was, it doesn't compare the the likes of Silver, Gold, Yellow etc.Parents, if you're wanting to get your kids into Pok√©mon, the best thing you could do for them is get them an original Gameboy and then work them up to the newer games. Teach them the same resilience I was taught. Teach them about losing gracefully and about battling gym leaders over and over, not to mention the original Elite 4!",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,6,2020,Royaume-Uni
"I got this with my switch to pass the time over last Christmas.Firstly, i love all things pokemon however i haven't played a pokemon game (except pokemon go) since my Nintendo DS days.The game itself has good graphics and gameplay. It follows the usual story line of a trainer looking to become pokemon champion but in a new region/setting.If you like pokemon you probably will like the game as i did. The only downside i'd say is the gyms and how many trainer battles there are. I prefer the gym battles from the classic pokemon game where you had a bunch of junior trainers to avoid and battle as you wish. it just added a bit more of a dynamic.However i still enjoyed it overall and the nostalgia has got me getting my old DS out to play pokemon soul silver.",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,9,2020,Royaume-Uni

"Sadly the same old game.I adore the Pokemon franchise and don't want to put it down for the sake of it. I've played from the very beginning of red and blue and each series since. And I am a massive Nintendo fan boy.All that being said the game is just lacking, its the same old  Pokemon game but with some new Pokemon in it. The game was actually feeling fresh up until the 1st gym the wild area is a good idea and roaming Pokemon like go Pikachu and Eevee is a good step. But after that its just the same old Pokemon game, go do the gyms with final challanges. The characters are nothing exciting, not bad just ok. The music is dull again not bad but nothing is catchy more like its there for the sake of it.I will grant it looks nice, and not having an entire national dex isnt an issue, there is alot of new pokemon and alot of them feel well designed. Also the online aspect is decent.Im actually yet to view a single review as im not bothered by them until I've actually finished a game.The main line games need a big shakeup! An actual epic journey and story! I feel 3 stars is a fair review its it's certainly not a bad game just an average one. I will continue to love the franchise.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,21,11,2019,Royaume-Uni

"Now hear me out, Pok√©mon is a anime/cartoon yes, and the games are somewhat based off of this. But, it seems that the imagination, is gone and a child is making up these new Pok√©mon that aren‚Äôt really unique. Granted there are some new ones in here, to me at least, that are new and pretty dope. I feel as if the game is to laid out  for the player there‚Äôs no thinking really involved anymore.

Definitely recommend!",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,18,4,2021,Royaume-Uni
"I've been a pokemon player since 1999 and heard a lot of negative reviews about the latest game. Ignore them.

I had a great time playing and I've already sunk too many hours into Pok√©mon Sword.In my opinion, the Pok√©mon introduced (which I was worried about from the leaks) we're very unique and had personalities that just made them interesting. I also really enjoyed the concept of dynamaxing because I felt it was balanced (unlike mega evolution) and it added a bit of drama to the gym battles.I know a lot of people seem to hate sword and shield but I would really recommend this game!",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,20,11,2019,Royaume-Uni

"I did enjoy this... Really I did, but it only gets three stars as I felt it was too linear. I've previously played blue, yellow and gold and thought this would be a cool first switch game. The graphics are incredible, the cut scenes look amazing. Because it's not got that realistic factor, everything looks so beautiful. However, I felt like I just did all the gym battles and that was it. There was a slight main story, but no adventures to go on alongside it. The version of team rocket was also awful. Team grunt who just cheer on a rival... I also found I didn't need to wander around leveling up my pokemon as they gained enough levels in the gym battles and the trainer battles you couldn't escape. It was a lovely pokemon experience, just too easy, quick and not enough. I hope next time they can up it.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,12,12,2019,Royaume-Uni

The game has received a lot of uneeded criticism that it does not deserve.Sure not all 900 pokemon are in it but in their place there are so many fantastic new ones.the game is a great one and is one of my favourites to date.If you give this game a chance it will not let you down so please give it a shot!,5,POKEMON,AMAZON,13,12,2019,Royaume-Uni
My son loves this game. Cool graphics and easy to play. Its interesting and fun.,5,POKEMON,AMAZON,10,5,2021,√âtats-Unis
"This game is cool to have a first experience on Nintendo Switch. If you have not played Pokemon Let's Go Pikachu or Eevee, the experience is really impresive, but the pokemon of this new generation are not a big thing. The gym battles are too easy and even the Tournament is not challenging at all.Apart from that, is a pretty chill game. I loved the option of camping with your party.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,21,3,2020,Royaume-Uni
"While the game itself does have some quality issues, it is nonetheless very fun to play, which is honestly what I most care about. Great if you're new to Pokemon.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,27,2,2020,√âtats-Unis
"Digital copies are the best because they will always be yours. That being said, the game came in brand new quality, and the game case is also new. The designs and the game itself is really awesome, definitely worth it!",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,8,6,2020,√âtats-Unis
"As I should have noticed in the rating in the corner, it says Pegi. I feel like the seller should have made sure to tell buyers that this is not a US copy in clearer terms. I guess people like me just need to read better next time.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,11,3,2021,√âtats-Unis
I do not play the game but my boys sure do like to play it.,5,POKEMON,AMAZON,12,4,2021,√âtats-Unis

"such a well made game, as someone from the UK the architecture and music make it feel just like home. some of the dialect is rather cheesy though",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,17,5,2021,Royaume-Uni
"Love it! It's most likely the perfect pokemon game for anyone that hasn't played the series before, as well as being great fun for long-time players! New features, new pokemon, new graphics! And expansions announced!",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,1,2020,Royaume-Uni

"What the old games had that this doesn't:PuzzlesSpooky areasTeam rocketGrindHarder gym battlesBetter musicThe use of Pok√©mon moves to solve and travel to places e.g. fly, rock smash, boulders, torchBetter cavesBetter storiesA sense of evilBetter NPCs 99% of the NPCs have boring dialoguePok√©mon contestsGamblingA likable professorBetter starter Pok√©monI'm sure there's more but thats what I can think of right now",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,13,12,2019,Royaume-Uni

"Despite what people were saying about Sword and Shiel, I still love the game and am enjoying the gameplay a lot.Has great new Pokemon up for offer, I love the gyms and there is a lot of character personalisation.Only downfall is that they could have spent more time with the story as some parts felt flawed.",5,POKEMON,AMAZON,1,12,2019,Royaume-Uni

What more to say. Good customer service from Amazon.,4,POKEMON,AMAZON,7,9,2020,Royaume-Uni
Would have loved a more modern take for the Pokemon franchise on the new gen console but this is just a rehash of the same old game with slightly updated art models. Old regular pokemon game players can skip this one... players who haven't played in a long time might enjoy a return the pokemon world.,3,POKEMON,AMAZON,31,3,2020,Inde

It is very fun but when you finish the game it is very boring unless you buy the expansion pass,5,POKEMON,AMAZON,5,4,2021,Inde

"Fairly repetitive game and kinda boring - I haven‚Äôt played Pok√©mon before and I ended up buying Pok√©mon Let‚Äôs Go after playing this one for a few hours, just because it has the Pok√©mon I‚Äôm familiar with from the tv show in the early 2000s.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,11,8,2020,√âtats-Unis
"- En buen estado en cuanto a envios y manejo, excelente en este aspecto.- EL JUEGO en si es muy aburrido y sus personajes no generan buena relacion con una historia tan infantil.- Para un ni√±o es perfecto.- Con servicio de envio a Colombia/Bogota.",2,POKEMON,AMAZON,23,12,2021,√âtats-Unis

"Absolutely not worth ¬£50. While still fun (it‚Äôs Pokemon), this is a ported DS game, that somehow also manages to have less content and extremely dislikable main characters.

"Pr√©commander un jeu sur Amazon, plus jamais ! Attendu vendredi, le jour de la sortie, il est arriv√© samedi sans qu'on ne sonne, ni ne me laisse d'avis de passage (merci la poste), je l'ai donc eu en main lundi. La prochaine fois, autant dire que j'irai au magasin.Pour le jeu en lui-m√™me, un peu d√©√ßue. Il donne l'impression de ne pas avoir √©t√© bien fini par moments (le graphisme tr√®s laid des arbres, certains d√©tails pas franchement jolis‚Ä¶). Certaines choses sont simplifi√©es, il n'y a plus de place festival par exemple, on √©change en direct. Je trouve le camping moins bien que la pok√©r√©cr√© : finit de gratouiller ses Pok√©mons, ou de soigner leurs alterations de statuts en les brossant. Le pok√©dex moins sympa (il me semblait qu'avant, on pouvait faire tourner √† 360 la cam√©ra), on ne voit plus les silhouettes des pok√©mon lorsqu'il y a des √©volutions, dommage, par contre il a l'air bien fourni.La custo de personnage est enfin correcte (j'en suis √† la 3√®me ou 4√®me ville, et c'est pas foufou, mais c'est mieux qu'avant). Les raids dynamax sont ok, c'est pas pire que les Bracelets Z, et c'est plut√¥t sympa de voir des Pok√©mons g√©ants.Les Pok√©mons attrapables seulement quand vous avez obtenu plus de badges par contre, c'est vraiment lourd, surtout quand on parvient √† les vaincre quand m√™me. Pas du tout pratique non plus les changements de saison, s'il vous faut une temp√™te de sable, vous √™tes bon pour revenir chaque jour √† l'endroit voir quel temps il fait, ou bien changer la saison en changeant le jour sur votre console.Dans les points positifs, il y a de jolis nouveaux Pok√©mons, le monde semi ouvert pr√©sage de bonnes choses pour l'avenir. A c√¥t√© de √ßa, les starters √©voluent encore en forme humano√Øde, et pour une fois, il n'y en a pas un seul que je trouve classe ou mignon en forme finale.Sinon √ßa, on retrouve les autres bons points habituels de pok√©mon, les combats pour les badges, les captures de pok√©mon sauvages, etc, mais je m'attendais √† mieux.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,11,2019,France
jeu parfait et envoye rapide merci,5,POKEMON,AMAZON,3,9,2022,France
"Apr√®s le remake rafraichissant de Let's go Evoli et Pikachu, on repart sur un gameplay plus classique. Le retour √† la capture de Pok√©mon apr√®s affaiblissement rend le jeu plus laborieux pour ceux qui n'ont pas connu le gameplay traditionnel et √ßa devient ridicule sur certains Pok√©mon tr√®s faibles qui c√®dent au premier coup ou s'enfuient syst√©matiquement apr√®s votre attaque (et comme vous ne les connaissez pas, vous devez t√¢tonner en mettant le Pok√©mon nul adapt√©)...Le fait d'√™tre dans des stades pour jouer, bof, seul ""l'√©preuve"" avant est dans l'ambiance du type du champion. L'utilisation d'un maillot est inutile (de m√™me que c'est b√™te de ne pouvoir personnaliser son v√©lo alors que l'on peut totalement relook√© son perso d√®s la premi√®re ville).La team de punk ""Yell"" est encore plus path√©tique qu'une team Rocket qui avait au moins un petit c√¥t√© fun.En ayant bien profit√© de la plaine du d√©but, on monte vite suffisamment des Pok√©mon pour ne m√™me pas avoir besoin du Dynamax pour gagner...Apr√®s la critique revient √† chaque g√©n√©ration, mais franchement, les nouveaux Pok√©mon sont tr√®s moyens, le Miaouss de Galar est affreux... Et les starters, ils n'ont pas le charme de ceux d'Alola.D'ailleurs, Galar est une r√©gion tr√®s fadasse et la paresse de graphisme des arbres, notamment dans la plaine du d√©but, est path√©tique (on dirait vraiment les arbres d'Ocarina of Time sur N64 et l'arbre √† baies a souvent des bugs de texture).Concernant les PNJ, un leader de ligue ridicule, un pr√©sident tout aussi ridicule, un ""ennemi"" tellement pr√©tentieux que sa faiblesse le rend path√©tique d√®s le premier combat, on est loin du style de Giovanni et du Conseil des 4...On a envie de se ""facepalmer"" devant ce jeu, parce que le ridicule tue le dr√¥le.Quand √† la fonction campement, bof, on dirait un bout de Zelda Breath of Wild qui s'est tromp√© de jeu...Bref, c'est fadasse et ennuyeux...",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,11,2019,France
"Le jeu a √©t√© simplifi√© et enfantis√© √† l‚Äôoutrance, on est limite prit par la main pour faire tout et n‚Äôimporte quoi, arriv√© √† la derni√®re ar√®ne il y‚Äôa beaucoup de r√©p√©tition des m√™mes actions pour faire durer le jeu mais √ßa le rend lassant.",3,POKEMON,AMAZON,18,9,2022,France
"Les jeux √©p√©e et bouclier sont sans doute les plus simples de tous ceux de la s√©rie principale !C'est de l'assistanat, il y a trop d'objets pouvant donner facilement sans entrainement de l'exp√©rience.Le Dynamax et Gigamax sont un m√©lange entre la M√©ga-√©volution et les capacit√©s Z.Le jeu est visuellement beau mais certains d√©tails ne plairont pas aux connaisseurs, notamment des arbres trop ""pix√©lis√©s"" et les animations de combat sont globalement dans le m√™me style que pour les jeux 3DS.Le nombre de nouveaux Pokemon est mieux fournit par rapport aux jeux de 6√®me et 7√®me g√©n√©ration.Et la plupart sont meilleurs qualitativement, il y a du potentiel et l'√©quipe design a fait du meilleur travail.C'est une bonne chose que Game Freak ait d√©cid√© de faire confiance √† des anglais pour superviser les designs de ces nouveaux pokemon.Il y a un bon d√©veloppement des personnages principaux, surtout des rivaux. Mais la plupart ne sont pas tr√®s marquants et charismatiques.Les antagonistes ne sont pas tr√®s pr√©sents et charismatiques non plus, comparer √† d'autres pr√©c√©dentes ""team"". Sans parler de la Team Yell...L'id√©e du D√©fi des ar√®nes est bonne cependant Game Freak s'est trop centr√©e dessus et fait pass√©e au second plan le reste. L'histoire est trop maigre par rapport √† de pr√©c√©dents jeux.La r√©gion de Galar en elle m√™me n'est pas tr√®s grande avec encore des routes √©troites et ""dirigeantes"" malgr√© l'apport des terres sauvages (qui est une bonne avanc√©e).Concernant les DLC, celui sur Isolarmure n'est pas tr√®s consistant, l'histoire est pauvre, c'est une √Æle enti√®rement sauvages divis√©e en plusieurs zones avec la cam√©ra tournant √† 360 degr√©s.Tandis que celui sur Couronneige est meilleur je trouve, en effet le sc√©nario est plus complet, la zone est plus grande que pour le premier DLC.Les exp√©dition Dynamax sont sympas et pour les 2 DLC, il s'agit d'un monde sous forme de ""terres sauvages"".Apr√®s est-ce qu'ils valent le prix √† payer en plus, bonne question ? c'est √† chacun de voir...En r√©sum√©, pas mal de bonnes id√©es mais le jeu montre qu'il a √©t√© b√¢cl√© et pas assez travaill√© (sans doute parce que les d√©lais sont trop justes et que sortir un jeu par an oblige les d√©veloppeurs √† se d√©p√™cher) ou alors que c'est juste une pompe √† fric et que le jeu aurait tr√®s bien pu sortir sur 3DS.En soit pour un jeu Pok√©mon, c'est un bon jeu comme la plupart de ceux de la s√©rie principale car le gameplay pla√Æt √† tout √¢ge mais pour un connaisseur ce sera diff√©rent peut-√™tre car le r√©sultat montre une part de fain√©antise chez le studio.",1,POKEMON,AMAZON,19,8,2020,France

"Apr√®s 10H de jeux.Les plus:(++) le design des nouveaux pok√©mons.(++) les musiques et th√®mes des combats dans les ar√®nes(+) la direction artistique en g√©n√©rale, la r√©gion de galar est charmante(+) l'interface utilisateur tr√®s bien pens√©e, une vraie am√©lioration par rapports aux versions pr√©c√©dentes(-/+) l'absence de nombreux pok√©mons des anciennes versions. Cela permet cependant d'apporter une certaine fra√Æcheur au jeu et √† s'attacher aux nouvelles bestiolesLes moins:(- -) un manque de finition:>certains personnages identiques apparaissent dans la m√™me sc√®ne,>les personnages et pok√©mons sortent de nulle part quand vous √™tes √† environs 10m d'eux>les environnements du mode combat ne correspondent g√©n√©ralement pas √† l'endroit ou vous rencontrez les pkms(-) l'absence de doublage lors des cin√©matiquesConclusion: am√©liorations notables par rapport √† la derni√®res version sur 3DS, ce n'est cependant du niveau des claques que l'on √† pu avoir avec Mario Odyssey et Zelda BoTw qui ont marqu√© leurs franchises.Si le manque de finition est flagrant, ces derni√®res versions sont n√©anmoins plaisantes √† jouer et cela a √©norm√©ment √† voir avec les nouveaux Pok√©mons de la r√©gion.",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,18,11,2019,France

"J'ai longtemps h√©sit√© √† me l'acheter, mais en fan de la premi√®re heure de la franchise, j'ai fini par craquer.Au final, par rapport √† tout le mal qui a √©t√© dit du jeu, j'en suis tr√®s agr√©ablement surprise! Il m'a d√©j√† fait passer de tr√®s bons moments (j'ai d√©j√† une vingtaine d'heures de jeu au compteur, et je n'ai toujours pas fini l'histoire), et son ambiance g√©n√©rale me rappelle X et Y, qui sont parmi mes pr√©f√©r√©s.Mais le jeu n'est pas exempt de d√©fauts, je vais donc m'efforcer de faire une liste concise des diff√©rents points que j'appr√©cie particuli√®rement, et ceux qui me posent le plus probl√®me:En positif:> l'ambiance du jeu: les graphismes (sans √™tre fantastiques! loin de l√†, mais ils restent sympas avec de sympathiques choix de couleur), la musique (un gros OUI pour moi), le design des espaces, villes et routes. Point particulier pour les pok√©mons visibles dans les herbes, et ceux qui restent cach√©s, conservant une part de surprise (et en ce sens: je suis tr√®s heureuse que les shinies ne soient d√©voil√©s qu'au moment du combat, contrairement √† let's go)> les Terres sauvages, zone en monde ouvert qui est une premi√®re dans la s√©rie: j'esp√®re en voir davantage dans de futurs jeux.> la nouvelle g√©n√©ration de pok√©mon. Globalement d√©√ßue des pok√©mons depuis la 5√® g√©n√©ration, cette g√©n√©ration m'emballe √©norm√©ment. J'adore!> la simplifications de certains aspects du jeu (maitre des noms, capacit√©s, acc√®s aux bo√Ætes partout, d√©but du jeu tr√®s facile, facilit√© de d√©placement tr√®s t√¥t dans le jeu...) qui permettent de gagner en fluidit√© et en rapidit√©.> L'histoire, courte et extr√™mement simple. C'est loin d'√™tre la ""meilleure"" histoire de la saga... mais je la trouve du coup plus agr√©able que soleil et lune qui n'en finissait pas. Et je pourrai rapidement me consacrer aux aspects du jeu qui me plaisent le plus: le shiny hunting et la compl√©tion du pok√©dex. Chacun son truc ;)Maintenant pour les aspects qui me d√©plaisent:> Le pok√©dex r√©duit √† 400 pok√©mon. C'est peu, pour un habitu√© de la franchise. Et une bonne partie de mes chouchous ne sont pas pr√©sents, je trouve √ßa franchement dommage. √ßa n'emp√™che pas d'appr√©cier le jeu, mais sur le long terme c'est tr√®s d√©cevant.> Le shiny hunting: il semblerait que GameFreak ait mis en place des syst√®mes pour rendre ces pok√©mons de couleur diff√©rente plus faciles √† trouver: tant mieux pour les amateurs de shasse rapide! Mais pour ceux, comme moi, qui pr√©f√®rent qu'un shiny reste rare et difficile √† trouver, ces nouvelles sont une d√©ception terrible, d'autant plus qu'une des mani√®res de garder ces shinies rare, c'est d'√©viter les combats... un comble pour ce jeu! Bref c'est dommage> le multi-exp impos√©... heureusement il est bien pens√©, on s'y fait vite, mais c'est dommage d'enlever encore une fois des options et de rendre obligatoire des aspects du jeu qui ne font pas l'unanimit√©.> Alors l√† c'est HYPER sp√©cifique et pas grave du tout mais bon dieu, l'ergonomie dans les cabines d'essayage: piti√© changez √ßa, devoir cliquer sur chaque v√™tement pour l'essayer, c'est d'un lourd!!!Mais √ßa me permet de terminer sur un aspect sympathique et tr√®s r√©ussi; la personnalisation de son avatar. Disponible d√®s le d√©but du jeu, et plus pouss√©e que dans les opus pr√©c√©dents, √ßa reste un plaisir de jouer avec un personnage qui nous ressemble :)",4,POKEMON,AMAZON,21,11,2019,France
"Le Pok√©mon bouclier a une histoire asser longue, passionnante bien penser mais diff√©rentes des anciens Pok√©mon, moins dur, on soigne nos Pok√©mon souvent, l ar√®ne final est pas tr√®s compliqu√© mais le jeu, de part les niveaux des adversaires reste plus complexe que let'go, ayant jouer a tout les jeux Pok√©mon, le jeu change , on part sur une nouvelle version compl√®te. 100* mieux que let's go mais moins attachant que certains sur ds , de part la nouveaut√© des pok√©mons plus enfantin.

"Ce jeu est une purge pour un jeu pok√©mon :- Des cin√©matiques √† n'en plus finir.- Une facilit√© d√©concertante.- Une dur√©e de vie qui fait honte √† ses pr√©d√©cesseurs.- Plus de la moiti√© des pok√©mons connus ne pourront jamais √™tre vu ou transf√©r√©s.- La paraisse des d√©veloppeurs sur le visuel et les graphismes transpire √† chaque seconde.Je pourrais continuer longtemps.
